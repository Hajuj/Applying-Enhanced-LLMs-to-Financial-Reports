25/11/2023,Autoliv to Capitalize on Backlog in Passive Safety Technology,Autoliv Inc,ALV,3,22/10/2023,Richard Hilgert,102.47,USD,24/11/2023,101.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,22/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Autoliv reported third-quarter earnings per share before special items of $1.66, missing the $1.79 FactSet consensus EPS by $0.13, but it is $0.43 ahead of the $1.23 reported last year. We believe the shortfall was due to a slight increase in customer output disruption sequentially from the second quarter and inflationary cost pressures. Revenue increased 13% to $2.6 billion as volume, customer recoveries, and the chip shortage all improved compared with a year ago. Excluding favorable currency, organic revenue increased 11%, outperforming a 4% increase in global light-vehicle production by 7 percentage points due to launched new business and customer recoveries. Adjusted operating income jumped 41% to $243 million from $173 million last year. Margin expanded 190 basis points to 9.4% from 7.5% last year on higher volume and cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by slightly worse customer call-offs compared with the second quarter. Despite the UAW strike at Autolivs Detroit 3 customers, management tweaked 2023 guidance higher with organic revenue growth of 17%, up from 15%, and reduced tax rate to 20% from 32% due to reorganization on cost-cutting efforts. Adjusted operating margin guidance was unchanged at 8.5%-9.0%. The UAW strike had minimal impact on the third quarter, but the firm said it expects $6 million in revenue per week strike impact and assumes the labor shutdown lasts until the end of November in its guidance. We model revenue slightly below managements guidance, with organic revenue growth of 15%. Due to high uncertainty remaining from the UAW strike, output disruption (chips, logistics), inflation, war in Ukraine and Israel, and weakening global auto market economies, we assume an 8.5% 2023 adjusted operating margin at the low end of guidance. The time value of money added $2 to our fair value estimate, lifting our fair value estimate to $101 from $99. The 3-star-rated Autoliv shares trade at a 4% discount to our new fair value.","Autoliv possesses a culture that enables regular and consistent innovation, commercializing technology that generates solid margins and returns on invested capital. Increasing safety content per vehicle across global markets is a growth opportunity for which Autoliv is well positioned. Rising U.S. and European NCAP safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use advanced safety technologies to achieve a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety systems interact with active safety.","The auto-parts supply industry is highly competitive and customers expect annual, contractual price reductions. The cyclical, capital-intensive nature of the industry means that a modest volume decline could translate into a significant drop in profitability. Raw material costs are volatile, adding a degree of uncertainty to margins.",22/10/2023,"Autoliv is the global market leader (43% share in 2022) and is well positioned for growth in vehicular passive safety content. An ability to innovate and then commercialize technology has helped support profitability and returns. Rising New Car Assessment Program safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use active safety features to even be considered for a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety products interact with active safety systems in occupant collision protection. As consumers in emerging markets become wealthier, demand for safety content should increase. In addition, as roads become more crowded and traffic fatalities increase, developing countries may require safety legislation similar to that required in Europe and the United States. Autoliv has demonstrated technological leadership. The company and its predecessors introduced two-point seat belts, the retractable seat belt, seat belt pretensioners, side-impact air bags, and various pedestrian collision safety technologies. It annually spends about 5% of sales on research and development and holds more than 6,600 patents, mainly in air bags and seat belts. Additionally, Autoliv has produced an average of 4.4 percentage points of returns in excess of its cost of capital since 2002. More than 70% of Autoliv's workforce is located in low-cost countries, compared with about 30% at the end of 2002. We view this as a strategic positive as Autoliv pursues business in developing markets, leading to a leaner cost structure and enabling the firm to spend larger amounts on research and development without compromising margins. It also positions the company to take advantage of its customers' objective to use more global, common vehicle architectures.","The sources of Autoliv's narrow economic moat rating include its intangible assets, high customer switching costs, and to a much lesser degree, its cost advantage. Some safety product areas are also oligopolistic, resulting in a slight efficient scale moat source benefit. The company's moat also benefits from a substantial global manufacturing presence, highly integrated and long-term customer ties that result in sticky market shares, and moderately improved pricing power from a well-diversified customer base. Since 2002, Autoliv's return on invested capital has exceeded its weighted average aftertax cost of capital for an average of 4.4 percentage points in economic profit. Autoliv's consistent technology innovation enables favorable pricing relative to many automotive industry suppliers, increasing the company's dollar content per vehicle. New innovations typically debut on European and North American luxury vehicles, where average safety content is around $400 per vehicle. In general, automakers are willing to pay for components and systems that provide substantial product differentiation, weight reduction, enhanced safety, or reduced cost, as is the case with Autoliv. Having a diversified global customer base provides Autoliv the opportunity to maximize pricing of its innovative product technologies by selling to a broader group of clients. Autoliv's customers would incur prohibitively high switching costs should they decide to withdraw business in the middle of a vehicle program, especially when Autoliv has a supply agreement for a complete set of passive safety systems. Costs for switching to another supplier would include the substantial lead time and investment to develop and validate new components, the potential for production disruptions, and the cost of moving equipment and tooling. The whole process of changing a critical supplier like Autoliv might cost an original equipment manufacturer as little as a few million dollars to as much as several hundred million dollars, depending on the size and scope of the components or systems being replaced.Automotive OEMs prefer vendors like Autoliv that can supply components and systems on a global basis. To reduce costs, some of the underlying safety components of a particular vehicle sold in the U.S. may be the same as another vehicle that might be sold in Europe, South America, or Asia. As emerging-market countries develop, a greater number of these safety components may become common to more than one region. Also, some countries have local content laws that require a certain percentage of components to be sourced from within that country. Winning a contract to supply a major component or system for a global vehicle program requires a supplier with a substantial global manufacturing presence.With more than 70% of Autoliv's global workforce now located in low-cost countries, the company has a lower fixed-cost base than other automotive suppliers without a moat. Developing a global footprint like Autoliv'swith 62 production facilities in 27 countrieswould require a huge capital investment, a substantial barrier to entry for potential competitors, particularly given the challenges for auto suppliers to consistently turn an economic profit. Close ties with OEM customers are integral to success in the automotive industry supply base and create another significant barrier to entry. New-vehicle lead times can run as long as 36 months. Autoliv's engineers participate very early in the development process, especially when an all-new vehicle platform is being developed, because safety is not only important to consumers but also mandated by governments. Once launched, most vehicle programs have a 5- to 10-year lifecycle, assuring Autoliv long-term contractual streams of revenue, albeit subject to volume changes dependent on consumer demand for specific models and overall economic conditions. When a vehicle nameplate has a complete redesign, including active and passive safety systems, and Autoliv is the supplier for the predecessor program, the company typically becomes the incumbent supplier for the redesigned successor vehicle program. In total, Autoliv potentially has a 6- to 13-year tie-up (development and production) with each customer's vehicle program. We view Autoliv's diverse, well-established, long-term, highly integrated customer relations, supplying hundreds of vehicle programs, as an invaluable barrier to entry.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Autoliv is High. Commodity costs and declines in global vehicle production present the biggest risk to Autoliv. Commodity exposure to volatile oil, steel, and copper prices adds risk to margins during periods of high inflation. Annual contractual price reductions for OEM customers are an auto industry norm, so Autoliv has to aggressively employ kaizen, kanban, and Six Sigma Lean manufacturing programs to advance cost savings. To maintain pricing and margin, Autoliv also requires continual investment in innovation. A loss of focus in cost reduction or technological development could result in an erosion of profitability and return on invested capital.Additionally, the company operates in a capital-intensive industry subject to cyclical demand. As a result, Autoliv has a high degree of operating leverage, so sudden declines in volume can have a meaningful impact on profit. Conversely, any increase in sales following large cost-cutting measures significantly raises profits. The potential changes to profitability brought on by the firm's operating leverage and cyclical demand results in our High Uncertainty Rating.We think Autoliv has some environmental, social, and governance risk exposure, which we include in our uncertainty rating. The firm supplies the global automotive industry, which is transitioning to zero-emission electric powertrains from emission-producing internal combustion engines. Autoliv provides passive safety products for electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. The firm also has product governance risk exposure from potential vehicle safety recalls, which have increased compliance scrutiny from various governments' safety regulations. Autoliv's products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain highly skilled human capital with expertise in various engineering disciplines.","We assign Autoliv a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized maintainable midcycle, we estimate Autoliv's return on invested capital exceeds its weighted average cost of capital by roughly 10 percentage points.The balance sheet is sound, with 1.1 times net debt/EBITDA and a net debt/total capital ratio of 14% at the end of December 2022. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound. Management states that it targets net debt/EBITDA of 0.5-1.5 times and a strong investment-grade credit rating. Since 2012, the company has returned roughly $3.2 billion to investors, averaging about $300 million per year, in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. During the past 15 years, Autoliv's median dividend payout ratio is approximately 35%. However, cash-conservation measures deployed because of COVID-19 included the suspension of the dividend and share repurchases after the first quarter of 2020. Autoliv reinstated its quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2021.Upon the spinoff of Veoneer in July 2018, Mikael Bratt became the president and CEO of Autoliv, replacing Jan Carlson, who had held the position since 2007 and who became president and CEO of Veoneer. Before assuming his current position, Bratt had been president of Autoliv's passive safety group since May 2016. Before joining Autoliv, Bratt was with Volvo Group for 30 years, most recently serving as the executive vice president in charge of group truck operations and previously as Volvo Group CFO. We expect Bratt to continue Autoliv's record of creating shareholder value.We like that management creates shareholder value by returning profits to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After the 2009 Great Recession, the company resumed its dividend effective for the third quarter of 2010 and increased it 17% for the fourth quarter of that year. In 2020, the company terminated quarterly dividends after paying $0.62 per share in the first quarter. The dividend was reinstated in the second quarter of 2021 at $0.62 per share but raised to $0.64 in the fourth quarter and then to $0.66 late in 2022. During the 15-year period from 2007 to 2022, dividends per share grew at a 4% average annual rate. A share-repurchase program is still in effect. The company reactivated a share-repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2013. Since then, Autoliv has repurchased over $1.1 billion worth of its stock. In November 2021, the board authorized a new share-repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion or 17 million shares, whichever comes first, from January 2022 to the end of 2024. Autoliv also deserves credit for its financial transparency. The company provides more detailed information than many of the parts companies we cover.","Autoliv is the global leader in passive safety components and systems for the auto industry. Products include seat belts, frontal air bags, side-impact air bags, air bag inflators, and steering wheels. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is the company's largest customer at 11% of 2022 revenue, with Stellantis accounting for 11% and Volkswagen 10%. At 34% of 2022 revenue, the Americas was Autoliv's largest geographic region, followed by Europe at 27%, China at 21%, and Japan at 8%.","We view Autoliv's financial health as relatively strong for an auto-parts supplier. Excluding commercial paper and overdraft facilities, the company has excellent liquidity of $1.7 billion, with approximately $0.6 billion in cash and an undrawn $1.1 billion revolving credit line at the end of December 2022. Since 2012, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR has averaged an investment-grade credit level of 1.9 times. While credit facilities are unsecured and there are no financial covenants on the firm's debt, management seeks to maintain a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.5-1.5 times and was at 1.1 times at the end of 2022. Overall, Autoliv's financial health and free cash flow generation are much better than many in its peer group. We view the company as being well positioned to withstand a challenging decline in global new-vehicle demand, which was demonstrated during COVID-19-induced industrywide factory closures in 2020.Autoliv has generally maintained a conservatively financed balance sheet. Capital requirements have been met with funding from operating cash flow and the company's unsecured revolving line of credit. Since 2012, total debt/total capital has averaged 16.1%, while net debt/total capital, which takes into consideration the company's cash position, has averaged 6.3%. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, a leverage metric that takes into consideration a company's use of operating leases, has averaged 1.9 times but has exceeded the average every year since 2018 at or above 2.2 times after taking on debt in conjunction with the Veoneer spinoff. Veoneer received a $970 million cash infusion from Autoliv to fund heavy R&D spending.",ALV,Consumer Cyclical,8838937600.0,NYQ,586767.0,USD,102.47000122070312,True,0,96.59317609001056,109.24853683099512,1
24/11/2023,"Arista Dominates High-Speed Switching, Earns a Wide Moat, and Is Making Inroads Into Campus Networks",Arista Networks Inc,ANET,2,10/11/2023,William Kerwin,217.69,USD,23/11/2023,160.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,10/11/2023,"We maintain our $160 fair value estimate for shares of wide-moat Arista Networks after a positive and informative 2023 analyst day. Arista provided a 2027 financial model that largely agreed with our existing forecasts. Management highlighted continuity in Aristas successful strategy, focusing on high-speed hardware and transparent and efficient software to differentiate and win placements in customers. We liked in-depth discussions surrounding artificial intelligence and how Aristas portfolio is implemented in large AI clusters. Shares dipped 6% afterhours following the session, which we view mostly as a coming back to earth after a 20% rise since Aristas bullish earnings call less than two weeks prior. We agree with the market that Arista has a ripe opportunity in clouds, enterprises, and AI applications, but we continue to see valuation as challenging. AI applications were Aristas focus during the event. While Arista is the market share leader for high-speed Ethernet switching in cloud customers, its revenue from the back end of AI clusters (which involves communication between graphics processing units) is small, with Nvidia bundling its own infiniband connectivity with sales of its GPUs. Arista is targeting rapid growth in the AI back end, growing to $750 million in 2025. Aristas overall financial targets were highlighted by a 15% top-line growth target through 2027. This target represents a slowdown from superb growth since 2020 and is in line with our model. Elsewhere, Arista is targeting 63% non-GAAP gross margin and 40% non-GAAP operating margin in 2027, both of which we believe the firm can achieve. We liked the firm providing a back-end AI sales target, as well as managements reiteration of its $750 million campus revenue target, also in 2025.","Arista Networks has gained a top market share position in high-speed switching, resulting, in our view, from technology leadership, and it continues to gain share. Arista holds best-in-class profit margins and earns robust economic profits, reflecting its strong value proposition and wide economic moat. Arista earns heady free cash flow, which it can use for organic investment and shareholder returns.","Arista Networks has a weaker position in areas of networking outside high-speed switching and may struggle to expand into adjacent markets. We see heightened investment and competition from Cisco in Aristas core high-speed market, which may make growth and market share gains more difficult. Aristas acquisition history is small and new, and it could risk destroying shareholder value with ill-advised deals.",31/10/2023,"We view Arista Networks as the technology leader in high-speed switching for enterprise networking. We expect Arista to maintain its top market of high-speed ports above 100 gigabits and for it to augment its share in lower speeds and campus applications where it has historically been less penetrated. In our view, Aristas software gives it a structural and durable competitive advantage over competitors in winning new customers, both in the cloud and in the enterprise. We believe this software-led approach provides the firm with a wide economic moat. Aristas performance at high speeds and its software-led approach set it apart from other networking equipment providers. Its Extensible Operating System, or EOS, gives customers a highly programmable, modular, and single image solution that can reduce downtime. Arista has foregone the proprietary hardware-plus-software lock-in approach of Cisco in favor of utilizing cutting-edge merchant silicon and focusing on software development, which allows the firm to offer top-tier performance at a competitive price point. We think its software focus has generated significant intangible assets and embeds it deeply with customers. Arista is now looking to expand from its high-speed cloud heritage into the larger (and in our opinion, stickier) enterprise market. Arista first established itself in the most cutting-edge applications for hyperscalers, but we believe its modular software approach will prove attractive for smaller enterprises building out private clouds or on-premises data centers. We think share gains in the campus market will come, but more slowly. We view the enterprise market as stickier than the cloud market, due to more extended refresh cycles and more strained IT departments. In our view, Aristas further penetration into the enterprise market will embed Arista deeper with its customers, augment switching costs, and widen the firms economic moat. Finally, we expect Arista to maintain its excellent profitability as it scales, with a robust research and development budget maintaining its intangible assets and its ability to exact pricing power. ","We assign Arista Networks a wide economic moat rating based on intangible assets in high-speed networking and customer switching costs. We view Aristas high-speed switches and software-led approach as significantly differentiated from other networking competitors and very difficult to replicate. We expect strength in high-speed switching to generate economic profits for Arista, more likely than not, over the next 20 years.Aristas networking switches for high-speed applications are best of breed, in our view, resulting from a software-led approach over its networking hardware. Aristas specialty within networking is high-speed switches, at speeds of 100 gigabits or more, that are designed for data centers. These switches create a local network to then connect to a wider network and the internet. Data traffic continues to explode, increasing the need for Aristas gear, in our view.We believe Aristas high-speed switches are the preferred option of both public cloud providers and enterprises building private clouds, and it occupies roughly one third of the market for 100-gigabit ports and faster. It has gained this share steadily since its founding in 2004 and has dethroned networking colossus Cisco at high speeds. We believe Aristas share gains are the result of fundamentally better performance at higher speeds and a software-led approach that outsources semiconductor development to merchant silicon from the likes of Broadcom and Marvell.Aristas extensible operating system, or EOS, sets it apart from Cisco and other networking players and represents considerable intangible assets, in our view. We see Aristas differentiation clearly in its first-class gross profit marginsrivalled only by Cisco (with which it is neck-and-neck) in networking equipment providers.Aristas decentralized software is the product of nearly two decades of developmentmoving from system-based software initially to a newer database and data lake approach. EOS presents a unique value proposition: its decentralized and open structure makes it appealing to hyperscalers with large IT teams that want to fine-tune software for mass deployment, while its robust array of features and modular APIs makes it easy to deploy for smaller-scale enterprise data centers. For all customers, Aristas single image and fault-containment offer the possibility of easier network upgrades and lower downtime.This contrasts with a networking competitor like Cisco, which focuses on features but locks customers into a closed ecosystem of chips, hardware, and software, all of which generate significant switching costs at their respective customers. We dont foresee Cisco abandoning its walled garden in favor of Aristas open approach. An existing networking competitor would have to rebuild its software platform to rival EOS decentralization and single image, and likely risk an inferior product lacking over a decade of evolution and fine-tuning based on customer feedback. On the other hand, an aspirational new entrant would find it difficult to build out an equally rich feature set of code and match Aristas efficiency and security, even if it were to achieve hardware parity using merchant silicon.We also see switching costs for Arista. We think networking equipment broadly carries switching costs for well-positioned providers. Aristas proprietary software and hardware configurations require training and certifications, requiring weeks of class, hours of testing, and thousands of dollars in expense. Furthermore, networking setups take months to implement and years to optimizeForrester claims that a typical business doesnt fully utilize the value of new networking technology for two years. If a company were to switch away from Arista, it would require wholesale retraining of its workforce under a new vendor, inclusive of the time and expense to do so. Furthermore, an IT department would spend the time and expense of getting the new network off the ground and have to redesign workflows and processes to accommodate different software and optimize operations. Even cloud customers, which we typically think of as conducive to lower switching costs due to their multisourcing and disaggregated buying patterns, experience the stickiness of Arista equipment. Even if Arista isnt installed in an entire network, the portions in which it operates become sticky, as cloud customers develop workflows for, and write software on, EOS. We also view EOS as complementary to base software like Microsofts SONiC or Metas FBOSS. Microsoft, as an example, uses EOS working on top of SONiC for portions of its network, which gives it the programmability and features of EOS while maintaining consistency with other non-Arista portions of its network.We view the combination of Aristas strength in networking hardware and software design with inherent switching costs to networking equipment as creating a wide economic moat to defend against competitive threats to economic returns for 20 years.","We assign Arista Networks with a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Aristas sales are concentrated in the cloud networking market, which can exhibit cyclicality and lumpy spending patterns from customers. This lumpiness can be exacerbated by Aristas concentration in customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Softer spending patterns at these customers can cause top-line performance to suffer, as seen in 2019 and 2020 when Meta skipped an upgrade cycle.Arista is working to expand its presence in the larger enterprise market, both in on-premises data centers and campus environments. Aristas market share in on-premises data centers trails its presence in high-speed cloud setups, and it has historically not been a participant in campus. We think its efforts to penetrate these markets creates uncertainty. Arista breached the cloud market with cutting-edge high-speed performance, but it may struggle to match the comprehensive portfolio of Ciscoinclusive of cybersecurity and collaboration softwarefor smaller customers and campus environments. If it is unable to successfully make inroads, its performance could suffer.On the environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, front, we foresee little risk for Arista. We view the biggest risk as a data or security breach via its equipment that could create permanent reputational harm for the firm, but we view this risk as low.","We assign Arista Networks with an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, based on our assessments of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.Aristas balance sheet is strong and provides the firm with flexibility. It has no gross debt and more than $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. We also view its newfound share repurchase program as appropriate. We expect the firm to maintain annual buybacks in excess of what it needs to offset dilution from share-based compensation now that it generates heady cash flow and can eke out operating leverage.Aristas investments have been exceptional, in our view, and drive our Exemplary capital allocation rating. The firm has focused on organic investment for most of its history, of which we approve. We view positively its strategy of using cutting-edge merchant silicon and focusing its development on software, which has led, in our opinion, to its wide economic moat. As a larger company, we think its recent small acquisitions have been prudent to expand into adjacent markets and round out its portfolio, but we continue to like that its primary investment is organic.","Arista Networks is a networking equipment provider that primarily sells Ethernet switches and software to data centers. Its marquee product is its extensible operating system, or EOS, that runs a single image across every single one of its devices. The firm operates as one reportable segment. It has steadily gained market share since its founding in 2004, with a focus on high-speed applications. Arista counts Microsoft and Meta Platforms as its largest customers and derives roughly three quarters of its sales from North America.","We view Aristas balance sheet and cash flow generation as very strong. Going forward, we expect it to focus its cash flows on organic investment first, followed by bolt-on M&A and opportunistic repurchases. Arista had a net cash position of $3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, with no debt on its balance sheet. It has consistently covered its obligations and organic needs with strong free cash flow. We forecast it to average more than $2 billion in annual free cash flow through 2027 as volume grows. Though Arista has historically focused its cash wholly on organic investment, we believe its newfound acquisition and repurchase programs have been prudent. It has returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via repurchases since 2019, while bolting on several small, technology-focused acquisitions. We expect these modest spending patterns to continue and believe these are necessary for Arista to scale up and maintain competitiveness with a larger incumbent like Cisco.",ANET,Technology,67396702208.0,NYQ,1644601.0,USD,217.69000244140625,True,0,189.67376439711882,254.8838278687988,1
24/11/2023,Chugai Leads Japans Oncology Market and Innovates With Cutting-Edge Antibodies,Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd,4519,3,27/10/2023,Jay Lee,5073.0,JPY,24/11/2023,4860.0,High,Narrow,Standard,A,27/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Chugai's third-quarter earnings were slightly better than expectations on strong overseas shipments of Hemlibra to Roche, which were buoyed by robust demand as well as favorable currency rates. The company is on track to meet its full-year guidance of JPY 1.07 trillion revenue and JPY 415 billion operating profit and may even outperform slightly. We maintain our fair value estimate of JPY 4,860. We view shares as close to fairly valued. The company highlighted crovalimab (C5 sweeping antibody), nemolizumab (IL-31RA inhibitor for atopic dermatitis outlicensed to Galderma and Maruho), Enspryng (IL-6 sweeping antibody), and orforglipron (nonpeptide oral GLP-1 receptor agonist outlicensed to Eli Lilly) as the next drivers of growth for the short to midterm and reviewed recent clinical trial initiations and results. We have previously highlighted these assets as commercially promising and differentiated in design. Although we had hoped for faster progress on its middle molecule (circular peptide) program, such as LUNA18, the progress reported on these assets gives us confidence in the company's late-stage pipeline. Based on phase 2 data, orforglipron has a highly competitive profile compared with other oral GLP-1 drugs, with patients dosed with 45mg daily experiencing 10.6% and 12.4% placebo-adjusted weight loss at weeks 26 and 36, respectively. Although the company does not disclose royalty rates, we tentatively guess that it might be low (such as midsingle digits) given that this drug was outlicensed to Lilly in September 2018 at the preclinical stage. Nonetheless, given the massive potential of the oral GLP-1 market, there is potential upside for the company's revenue and profit margins if the phase 3 trial confirms the phase 2 data.","Chugai controls about 20% of the Japanese oncology market and is the countrys leading drug developer in both oncology and therapeutic antibodies overall. The alliance between Chugai and majority shareholder Roche appears to be strengthening, as Chugai's novel antibody technologies generate promising drug candidates like Hemlibra and Chugai benefits from Roche's diagnostics arm and personalized medicine potential. Hemlibra is growing faster than expectations and is quickly becoming the standard of care for hemophilia A patients.","Despite Hemlibras early success, it could potentially see challenges from gene therapies within a few years. Roughly half of Chugai's business is focused on Japan, and reform measures, biennial price cuts, and increasing receptiveness to generic and biosimilar versions of drugs could weigh on Chugai's growth. Roche and Chugai could struggle to maintain their oncology leadership if Tecentriq (third to market in the class) doesn't see strong uptake.",02/08/2023,"Japanese drug firm Chugai Pharmaceutical has established competitive advantages due to its alliance with majority shareholder Roche as well as its internal research and development engine. While current top products could see new branded and biosimilar threats over the next several years, the combined Roche-Chugai pipeline is robust and promising. Chugai was founded in 1925 and developed into one of Japan's leading biotech companies in the 1990s, launching Epogin (1990) and Neutrogin (1991). In 2002, Chugai merged with Roches small-molecule Japan affiliate, Nippon Roche, and Roche became the parent company, owning approximately 61% of the shares at the end of 2021. Chugai has launched many Roche products in the Japanese market, helping the firm achieve leading share in Japan for therapeutic antibodies and oncology drugs. Although many of Roche's older drugs have seen loss of exclusivity, its PD-L1 antibody Tecentriq has been a growth driver, and we think Vabysmo can help Chugai build an ophthalmology portfolio in Japan, a therapeutic area which we view as accretive to the company's narrow moat. Chugai also has strong in-house antibody development platforms, and enjoys royalty payments from Roche on ex-Japan sales of these assets. The companys most important drug is Hemlibra, which launched for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors in 2018 and was approved for the broader noninhibitor population in October 2018. We have peak sales of $6.5 billion globally ($4 billion for Chugai, including royalties). On top of that, it has a plethora of early , mid-, and late-stage assets, which we believe will maintain growth and returns for at least the next 10 years. We hold Chugais research and development capability in high regard, as validated by innovative drugs like Hemlibra, Enspryng (IL-6 sweeping antibody), crovalimab (C5 sweeping antibody), orforglipron (non-peptide oral GLP-1 receptor agonist out-licensed to Eli Lilly), and nemolizumab (IL-31RA inhibitor for atopic dermatitis). Other early-stage modalities include bispecific T-cell engagers, switch antibodies that become active in the presence of another substance (such as ATP), and middle molecules.","We believe Chugai has established a narrow economic moat because of intangible assets. These consist of marketing rights in Japan for drugs in-licensed from majority owner Roche, as well as its own portfolio and pipeline of drugs developed in-house, or in collaboration with Roche.Chugai is a research-based biotech firm with strengths in oncology assets and antibody design. It is the leader in Japans therapeutic antibody market, with 25% share in 2018. It has maintained leadership in the domestic oncology market for 10 years, largely due to Roches portfolio, with 20% share in 2017. Its largest segment is Japan oncology sales, which are mostly drugs from Roches portfolio and constituted 22% of total revenue in 2022. It includes Avastin, Herceptin, and Rituxan, which are declining franchises due to loss of exclusivity and biosimilar threats, and Tecentriq, which is Roches blockbuster PD-L1 inhibitor that is steadily gaining approvals in new cancer indications. Key drugs in other therapeutic areas include Hemlibra, a bispecific antibody created by Chugai that is changing the treatment landscape for hemophilia A, and Actemra, an IL-6 inhibitor for autoimmune diseases.We believe the portfolio is well-positioned to generate robust cash flows. Although much of its portfolio has been exposed to biosimilar competition recently, the company has brought several new drugs to market with strong growth trajectories, namely Hemlibra and Tecentriq. We estimate by 2029, more than 60% of the companys revenue will be derived from drugs that have not gone off patent or otherwise enjoy limited market competition. In addition to its parents portfolio, Chugai itself has strong research capabilities and has produced a number of significant antibodies, including Actemra and Hemlibra. Hemlibra was the second bispecific antibody to get approval, and it is an excellent demonstration of Chugais abilities to create cutting-edge antibodies.While we like the strengths of Chugais portfolio and pipeline, two key limiting factors to the moat rating are the portfolios concentration and its geographic concentration in Japan. By 2030, we project the top three drugs (Hemlibra, Tecentriq, and Alecensa) to contribute over 40% of revenue (including royalties for Hemlibra and Alecensa). While this portfolio still has a reasonable level of diversity, it is not the same extent that we typically see in wide-moat firms. Additionally, there is heavy geographic exposure to Japan, with about half of its revenue coming from the domestic market. Due to Japans aging population, the government views increasing national medical expenses as a serious problem and has committed to a number of cost-control measures, including biennial cuts to reimbursement prices on the order of 5%-7% overall (with the potential for annual price cuts as well), increasing the use of generics to 80% of volume in 2020 from 66% as of 2017, and doubling the number of biosimilars by 2021.We believe Chugais new drugs and late-stage pipeline will largely offset competitive headwinds for old drugs. A number of key products are experiencing stiff declines in revenue due to biosimilar competition, including Avastin, Herceptin, Rituxan, and Edirol, and a few others will likely face heavy declines within the next few years, including Actemra and Mircera. However, these are being offset by the growth in new products, especially Hemlibra and Tecentriq. Other notable growth contributors include Enspryng (long-acting IL-6 inhibitor using Chugais recycling antibody platform) and Foundation Medicine (a genomic profiling service from Roche). Further down the line, we believe the combination of Roches massive pipeline and Chugais differentiated in-house antibody platforms will create new drugs to replace the current wave of newly approved drugs. In oncology, there are several drugs worth highlighting. The most notable cancer drug is Roches Tecentriq (atezolizumab), an immuno-oncology antibody with strong revenue potential in a wide array of indications. It was approved by Japan in December 2018 as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and is steadily gaining approval in new indications. However, this class of drugs (called PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is becoming an increasingly competitive field. Tecentriq was the third to launch in Japan after market leader Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab), and several Chinese drugs with far cheaper prices and good clinical data could eventually enter Japans market too. Nonetheless, we think Tecentriqs progress in next-generation combination trials (such as early data from a combination with Roches TIGIT inhibitor tiragolumab) could help it maintain its market share. Alecensa is an in-house drug that was approved in 2014 and serves as a first-line treatment for specific indications of NSCLC. It is likely to continue increasing its revenue in the domestic and overseas markets and may eventually get close to blockbuster status. Finally, Roches Gazyva is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that may help replace a portion of lost Rituxan sales, thanks to its superior survival data in combating leukemia and follicular lymphoma. Outside oncology, Hemlibra is Chugai's most significant drug. This bispecific antibody for hemophilia A patients was developed in-house, and Roche obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2017. The previous standard of treatment for hemophilia A was effective, but typically requires intravenous administration of Factor VIII every few days. Hemlibra, on the other hand, can be self-administered with an injection weekly, biweekly, or every four weeks and therefore offers a significant lifestyle advantage and is expected to become the new standard of care. This drug received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA and has promising revenue potential, although there is the looming threat of gene therapies and other long-acting Factor VIII mimetics. However, we think Hemlibra can continue to enjoy a reasonably long lifecycle against treatments with incrementally longer dosing periods, given its established use in clinical practice. Additionally, we think gene therapies will have a slow sales ramp due to their high costs and questions about long-term durability. One Hemlibra competitor we are watching closely is Novo Nordisks Mim8, a long-acting hemophilia A treatment, that is in a phase 3 trial and scheduled for primary completion in the first half of 2024. Chugai has a number of proprietary antibody platforms for generating future pipeline assets, some of which have already produced commercial stage drugs. These include: recycling antibodies designed to improve half-life (such as Enspryng), sweeping antibodies designed to remove antigen (such as crovalimab, a C5 inhibitor for paroxymal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), bispecific antibodies (including Hemlibra and early-stage next-generation T-cell engagers), and switch antibodies designed to only bind to antigen in the presence of another chemical (such as ATP, which is elevated in the tumor microenvironment).Finally, Chugai has been developing middle molecules, which theoretically could possess a small molecules ability to reach intracellular targets combined with a large molecules ability to engineer high specificity to its intended target and reduce off-target effects. It has a midsize molecule in early clinical trials called Luna18, which is an oral pan-RAS inhibitor. Although most projects are early-stage, the novel approach of these platforms gives us a favorable impression of Chugais innovation capabilities.","We assign Chugai a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Although demand for pharmaceutical products is relatively inelastic, the firms valuation is highly reliant on the ramp-up and pricing of new drugs and pipeline drugs.One key risk facing Chugai is the limited long-term growth potential in Japan, which accounts for half of revenue. Due to slowing economic growth and aging demographics, the Japanese government has been using stronger and stronger cost-cutting measures to reduce healthcare expenditure. Beyond the biennial price reductions, Chugai has experienced significant one-time price reductions from revisions to Japans National Healthcare Insurance, even for more innovative therapies such as Herceptin and Avastin, as they cross certain sales thresholds. Also, due to recent government efforts, Japans market has been receptive to biosimilars, which has hurt the sales of older biologics like Rituxan, Avastin, and Actemra. A material portion of our valuation of Chugai comes from projected revenue growth of two recently launched drugs, Hemlibra and Tecentriq. Hemlibra is a promising therapy that is substantially more convenient than current treatments, but growth depends on its ability to break into the hemophilia patient population, which is notoriously conservative and loyal to current treatments. Additionally, gene one-time therapies could launch within the next couple of years. Although we do not think gene therapies will immediately replace Hemlibra as the standard of care due to high cost and limited data on long-term efficacy, they do present a serious threat as they are the ultimate treatment for this type of disease. We assume greater than 50% probability of ongoing drug price cuts for key products, and have modeled these in our base-case forecasts.","We assign Chugai a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate distributions. We think positively of its portfolio and the direction of its innovation, which has paid off with successful drugs like Hemlibra (hemophilia A) and Actemra (rheumatoid arthritis, COVID-19). With no debt and healthy cash flow, it is well-positioned to continue a high level of investment in research and development, and we think its average dividend payout ratio of 50% is sensible given its position as a mature biopharmaceutical company.Tatsuro Kosaka replaced Osamu Nagayama as CEO in March 2018 and designed a midterm business plan that began in 2019. Kosaka was previously Chugai's president and COO and has also been at Chugai for decades, leading us to believe this should be a smooth transition. Nagayama will continue as board chairman. Nagayama joined Chugai in 1978 after a brief career in finance and has served as an executive since the early 1990s. Nagayama, who oversaw the acquisition by Roche Holding in 2002, brought the company to new heights due in large part to Chugais commitment to research and development. The board has 10 members, including three outside directors, as well as strong representation from Roche (including Daniel ODay, Sophie Kornowski-Bonnet, and Roche board Chairman Christoph Franz).","Chugai Pharmaceutical is a Japanese drug developer and subsidiary of Roche Holding Ltd, which owns roughly 60% of the company. Founded in 1925, Chugai deals primarily in the Japanese market, where it generates roughly half of its revenue. It has been the leader in Japans oncology market for the past decade, largely due to drugs licensed from its parents portfolio. The company also develops its own innovative medicines. It is an industry leader in antibody technology with several flagship therapies, including Hemlibra for hemophilia A patients and tocilizumab for treating rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19.","Chugai is in strong financial health, with virtually no debt and a cash position of JPY 222 billion as of the end of 2022. Chugai does offer a small dividend (in the context of 2% dividend yield at recent prices), and we assume the firm could continue to see a dividend payout ratio of roughly 50% of its net income.",4519.T,Healthcare,8749426671616.0,JPX,2614100.0,JPY,5073.0,True,0,4469.621951219512,5624.037974683544,1
25/11/2023,Interactive Brokers Update: Slightly Decreasing Fair Value Estimate to $112,Interactive Brokers Group Inc,IBKR,4,18/10/2023,Michael Wong,81.8,USD,24/11/2023,112.0,High,Narrow,Standard,D,18/10/2023,"Interactive Brokers reported strong third-quarter results. The company reported net income to common shareholders of $167 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, on $1.15 billion of net revenue. Net revenue increased 45% from the previous year and 15% sequentially. The increase in revenue from the previous year was primarily from a 55% increase in net interest income. We dont anticipate making a material change to our $112 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Interactive Brokers and view shares as undervalued. Interactive Brokers net interest income continues to benefit from the current high-interest rate environment. The interest income the company earns from clients' margin loans is tied to short-term rates, and it also remains ultrashort in duration with its investments (26 days in the investment portfolio). As rates have the potential to stay ""higher for longer,"" we assume the company's earnings power will stay at an elevated level. However, if the Federal Reserve cuts rates rapidly, we think net interest income will see pressure. Commissions increased slightly to 4% from a year ago. Like the pattern we saw last quarter, equity trading volumes were down 22% compared with a year ago while options' trading volumes increased by 19%. The management team also guided a lower client account growth from a slower onboarding of introducing broker client accounts. The updated client account growth was low- to mid-20% compared with 30%. As we update our model, we do not think this lowered guidance will have a material effect on our fair value estimate as we have already taken a more conservative viewour current forecast of 10-year client account CAGR is 14%.",Interactive Brokers short duration in its investment portfolio benefits from currently high interest rates. Interactive Brokers has active trading clients from proprietary traders and hedge funds that hold more cash and utilize more leverage. Interactive Brokers enjoys high client growth from international markets.,"Lower interest rates for an extended period would be detrimental to Interactive Brokers net interest income. If a recession occurs, the Fed might feel obligated to lower rates. Interactive Brokers lacks diversified services offering in wealth management and banking. While Interactive Brokers is well scaled compared with most peers, it has significantly less assets compared with the very largest brokers, such as Charles Schwab, which limits its ability to spread fixed expenses.",31/07/2023,"Interactive Brokers is a unique brokerage within our coverage. The firm serves a more niche client base. Apart from retail investors, the company also caters to the trading of institutional clients like hedge and mutual funds, proprietary trading groups, introducing brokers, and financial advisors. The commission mix between retail and institutional clients is about 55%/45%. Most of Interactive Brokers' clients still choose to pay commissions when many other retail brokerages switched to a zero-commission model for U.S. stock trading. The clients of Interactive Brokers are more sophisticated compared with the clients of Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E-Trade. To be more specific, they trade more frequently, maintain higher cash balances to make opportunistic moves, and take use leverage. These trading-savvy customers are attracted by Interactive Brokers low margin rates, comprehensive trading platform, sophisticated trading execution capabilities, and high interest paid on idle cash. Interactive Brokers approach requires strength in its routing system. The fact that hedge funds, proprietary trading groups, and introducing brokers choose its trading platform is a demonstration of its capabilities. The trading execution technology build-up and maintenance requires huge investment, which a lot of small introducing brokers do not want to deal with.  Another unique part of Interactive Brokers business is that the firm has a sizable international business, with around 80% of accounts being non-U.S. and about 50% of commissions coming from outside the Americas. The firm boasts its platform gives access to 150 electronic exchanges and market centers over 30 countries. However, we believe that the international clients are mostly attracted to its U.S. stock trading offering, not trading in their home countries. Interactive Brokers operating margin is around the high 60% mark, higher than the 45% to 50% margin of U.S. competitor Charles Schwab and its international competitor, Futu Holdings.","We believe Interactive Brokers warrants a narrow Morningstar economic moat rating based on cost advantage. Interactive Brokers has developed a sufficient scale to spread the fixed cost of its brokerage business to earn a cost advantage compared with its U.S.-based peers and especially its international peers. The firm has historically earned a much higher operating income margin of 60% that exceeds its U.S. peers (Charles Schwab at 40%-45%, TD Ameritrade at 40%-50%, and E-Trade at 35%-45%). A highly automated business process driven by proprietary technology allows Interactive Brokers to cut most human interfaces in terms of account opening, margin loan approval, trade execution, clearing, and compliance. The lower operational cost gives Interactive Brokers the edge on lower pricing on margin loans and high rates paid on unallocated cash balances to attract more productive clients.Interactive Brokers generates revenue from two major sources: trading commissions and net interest income. Commission income is mostly driven by trading volume with lot size, trading mix (options and futures pricing higher than equities), and the complexity of execution affecting commissions. Because Interactive Brokers offers access to trading on more than 150 electronic exchanges and market centers in over 30 countries and 25 currencies, traders are attracted to the trading platform and are more likely to engage in complex trading strategies that require quick execution speed and efficiency. The movement to zero-commission trade pricing in the U.S. creates some headwinds for trading commissions, but most of its customers value the firms trade execution capabilities, low margin lending rates, and short-selling system, so Interactive Brokers is more insulated in this respect as compared with pure discount brokerages.Net interest income is gaining more importance given the higher interest rate environment and headwinds from trading commissions. Interactive Brokers earns interest income by investing idle cash in client accounts into U.S. Treasuries and providing margin loans to clients. The firm pays interest on the unallocated cash of customer accounts, and Interactive Brokers earns net interest income based on the spread between interest income and interest expenses. The average client cash holding ratio over client assets is more than 20% for Interactive Brokers, as compared with 10%-12% at peers. This higher cash-holding and margin loan-using client base allows Interactive Brokers to generate more interest income over client assets and higher revenue yields over client assets.Apart from trading commissions and net interest income, the firm also earns miscellaneous fees from clients, such as market data fees, risk exposure fees, and payment for order flow. Other fees and services together are 6% of net revenue.Compared with the clients of Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade (acquired by Charles Schwab in 2020), and E-Trade (acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020), Interactive Brokers' client base skews toward active traders that generate more revenue per dollar of client assets than peers. Proprietary trading groups (3% of customer accounts and 17% of commission income) and hedge funds and mutual funds (1% of customer accounts and 8% of commission income) usually maintain a higher cash balance in their accounts to capitalize on changing market conditions. The active trader clients of Interactive Brokers not only trade more frequently but also utilize the margin lending capability more often. Interactive Brokers' clients hold 11% margin loans as a percentage of total client assets, much higher than peers with low-single-digit margin loan ratios. We believe Interactive Brokers will continue to offer attractive margin loan rates to attract these more professional trading clients. Interactive Brokers' more productive clients enable a 0.93% five-year average net revenue yield over client assets, or ROCA, 56 basis points higher than Charles Schwab and also much higher than E-Trade's ROCA at 0.60%-0.70% before being acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020. Apart from the all-inclusive product offerings to worldwide exchanges and securities, Interactive Brokers also offers low margin rates to all account-size tiers to attract shrewd traders. Specifically, the firm's most expensive tier (smallest account-size tier) on its website for margin loans in June 2023 was 6.58%, against 12.83% at Fidelity and Schwab, 13.45% at E*TRADE, and 14.00% at TD Ameritrade. Interactive Brokers has gained strong momentum in providing prime brokerage for small hedge fund clients. Per financial data provider Preqin, Interactive Brokers had the highest market share for hedge funds with under $50 million in assets and ranked fourth among prominent prime brokers servicing hedge funds launched in 2020 to first-half 2021.We think Interactive Brokers has developed a scale large enough to spread its fixed costs over its brokerage clients that gives it a competitive advantage compared with other brokerage firms. Variable costs for discount brokerage come primarily from execution, clearing, and distribution fees that grow with trading volumes. Interest expenses and customer bad debt expenses also grow with the scale of customer assets. Online brokerages do not have brick-and-mortar branches, so gaining additional client assets on their trading platform requires less expenditure. Stringent cost control and highly automated business procedures in the account opening process, margin lending approval, and short-selling lists display also contribute to bringing down noninterest expenses for Interactive Brokers. While funding cost is a common source of cost advantage for financial services companies within our coverage, we don't think Interactive Brokers qualifies in this respect. In order to attract clients, Interactive Brokers pays a relatively high interest rate on idle cash in client accounts, recently 50 basis points under the federal-funds rate. However, retail brokers like Charles Schwab and wealth management firms that sweep client cash into deposit accounts at banking partners may pay interest rates a couple hundred basis points less than the fed-funds rate. Per company disclosure and our estimates, over half of client cash balances are fully interest-bearing, meaning that Interactive Brokers will increase its interest expenses in line with each rate hike by the Fed. Interactive Brokers also maintains ultrashort duration in its investment portfolioonly three to four weekswhile Charles Schwab maintains a duration of around four years. This short-duration strategy is beneficial to the company in the high-rate environment and helps to match asset and liability maturities but can lead to a lower revenue yield than peers when the yield curve is upward sloping. Interactive Brokers also invests primarily in U.S. government Treasuries, so it has little credit risk in its investment portfolio. We believe that Interactive Brokers has built a size that is large enough to earn a cost advantage in its U.S. business segment in a highly competitive and consolidated brokerage industry. The movement to zero-commission pricing further accelerated the pace of consolidation. In 2020, Charles Schwab acquired TD Ameritrade and Morgan Stanley acquired E-Trade. According to our calculations, the largest retail brokers (Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood, and E-Trade) contribute about 21% of 548 billion shares of average U.S. equity daily trading volume in 2022.The noninterest expenses over client assets, or EOCA, ratio is a useful metric to measure and compare the cost level of different brokers. Intuitively, the larger the client assets base, the lower the expense ratio due to the fixed-cost nature of the brokerage business. Certain security types like options and futures carry high execution and clearing costs, so its also useful to exclude the trading expenses from the noninterest expenses to make it more comparable between different brokers. Interactive Brokers U.S. brokerage segments 0.39% EOCA in 2022 is much lower than Robinhoods 3.23% EOCA from 2020 to 2022. After excluding trading expenses, Interactive Brokers U.S. brokerage EOCA scores 0.27%, which is still lower than Robinhoods 3.00% EOCA. Interactive Brokers EOCA ratio excluding trading expenses is comparable with E-Trade (before acquisition) and TD Ameritrade (before acquisition) but is higher than Charles Schwab.Unlike the U.S. brokerage industry, the international brokerage space is far more fragmented and faces less competition in pricing. This is largely driven by smaller stock market sizes, market liquidity, and regulations. The U.S. stock exchanges take the lions share of market value, roughly 41% of global equities. Relatively small domestic stock markets, population, and wealth create obstacles for non-U.S. brokerages to grow their sizes and spread fixed costs. Different countries regulatory requirements and compliance efforts also add more difficulty for small brokerages to grow outside their domestic markets. With 12% of global equity market capitalization, China is the second largest stock market, but its stringent capital control makes it impossible for outsiders to build and grow a brokerage business. The EU is another large market, with 11% of global equity market capitalization, but the EU is not a large unified market. Thus, equity markets outside the U.S. often prevent the emergence of brokerages comparable in size with Interactive Brokers. Global investment banks offer brokerage services to institutional clients, while the retail space consists of small local brokers and domestic banks.After the global financial crisis in 2008, scrutinization and regulation in each country strengthened and added a compliance burden to brokers, and thus most U.S. brokers simply exited international brokerage. Interactive Brokers automation reduced the cost of duplicate development and allows it to grow outside the U.S. Interactive Brokers' international clients represent about 31% of revenue and 21% of operating income. European clients generate about 19% of total commission revenue, and Asia-Pacific contributes 30%. International clients value the low-cost access to trade U.S. stocks and other nondomestic securities via Interactive Brokers' platform as well as its low foreign exchange fees.We think Interactive Brokers international business has a cost advantage, as demonstrated by its low EOCA ratio over client assets when compared with many European and Asian brokers. For example, Futu Holdings is an Asia broker that offers trading access to U.S. and Hong Kong markets, while Swissquote and Saxo Bank are European retail brokers that provide access to pan-European markets and U.S. markets. After excluding trading expenses, Interactive Brokers international brokerage segments 0.17% EOCA is much lower than Futu Holdings 0.87%, Saxo Bank's 0.74%, and Swissquotes 0.56% over the last five years. ICICI Securities is an India domestic-only broker (11% of India active equity trading clients) whose EOCA is also higher than that of Interactive Brokers.Interactive Brokers' investment in automation allows it to run a global business efficiently. The company offers its trading platform to many international introducing brokers that dont want to set up trading platforms and only want to deal with selling, marketing, and customer service. Moreover, operating an international business that serves clients from 200 different countries and territories also requires satisfying various regulatory and compliance requirements that is difficult for peers to duplicate.Interactive Brokers' comprehensive trading platform arguably gives it some pricing power, as is demonstrated by its higher revenue yield over client assets ratio when compared with U.S. peers. Most retail brokers in the U.S. dont charge commissions on U.S. equity trading, and more than 90% of Interactive Brokers clients choose an Interactive Brokers trading plan that requires commissions.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Interactive Brokers.Interactive Brokers high fixed cost base is favorable when revenue growth is high but could also be detrimental to earnings when the top line goes down. The firms commission revenue is impacted by pricing, market volatility, market performance, and the trading mix of different securities. Interest rates are the key driver of the companys net interest income over the next few years. If rates are low, it will not only reduce the companys interest income from margin loans but also make the low margin loan rate relatively less attractive to clients when compared with Charles Schwab and Fidelity, which offer higher-margin loan rates. Lower interest rates over the next couple of years would likely cause a decline in earnings.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we believe Interactive Brokers risks are average. We view the largest risk as product governance issues because the brokerage business is data-intensive, and any failure to keep customer data secure and private could severely impact the companys reputation. Interactive Brokers also operates in many countries and is therefore exposed to regulatory, cultural, economic, political, and currency risks. In the governance area, founder Thomas Peterffy owns a controlling stake in the company. A high ownership stake should lead to goal alignment between Peterffy with common shareholders, but if there's any disagreement, Peterffy's voice will win out.","We give Interactive Brokers a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is mixed.Interactive Brokers is largely influenced by its founder and chairman Thomas Peterffy. Peterffy maintains control over the company through a minority shareholding with dual class shares that gives him about 70% voting interest. In 2007, Interactive Brokers went public, and Peterffy started slowly selling his personal shares to make the firm available to public shareholders. While we take a less optimistic view of such a large minority shareholding structure, our concerns are offset by Peterffys ownership view toward the company, and his salary is capped at 0.2% of the net income of the company. Milan Galik, who first joined Interactive Brokers as a software developer in 1990, became CEO in 2019 when Peterffy stepped down.We assess Interactive Brokers has a sound balance sheet with little debt, and we believe the firms strong free cash flow generation could easily fund its operations. We see Interactive Brokers' investment decisions as fair. The company is mostly investing in software development and also in hardware like computers, networks, and data centers to enhance its competitiveness as a broker. As the management team worked to divest its market-making business from 2017 to 2019, the company's balance sheet is now more streamlined, and we are pleased with managements focus on the brokerage business. Historically, Interactive Brokers was not very acquisitive, and we expect the firm to remain focused on organic growth. Its most recent deal was acquiring the retail brokerage business of Folio Investments from Goldman Sachs, adding around 70,000 retail accounts to the company.We regard Interactive Brokers shareholder distributions as mixed. Due to the large minority holding of Peterffy, the company only pays a quarterly dividend of $ 0.10 and has no share buyback plans.","Interactive Brokers is an online brokerage that generates trading commissions (around 43% of net revenue) from facilitating trading in a wide range of products, including equity, options, futures, foreign exchange, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Interactive Brokers also generates net interest income (about 54% of net revenue) from idle client cash and earns fees (about 6% of net revenue) from ancillary services. Principal trading and other miscellaneous activities are small (about negative 3% of net revenue). The firm derives about 70% of its net revenue from the U.S. and 30% from international markets.","We assess Interactive Brokers has a very healthy balance sheet, with no long-term debt and minimal short-term borrowings at the end of 2022.

As expected, results remained quite messy with multiple one-time charges, and an impairment charge of CAD 45 million is forecast for next quarter. Excluding the impact of Bank of the West, adjusted preprovision pretax income would have been down 4% year over year. As we have seen with peers, the environment in Canada remains more constructive than in the United States. The U.S. segment's net interest margin was down once again, while Canadian NIM and preprovision pretax income were both up sequentially. We do not expect the pressure in the U.S. to completely abate, although if the Federal Reserve refrains from further interest-rate hikes, the pressure should ease over the next quarter or two. Management struck a positive tone on the call about realizing additional revenue synergies, although in our experience these types of synergies are notoriously difficult to pin down. The bank took some severance-related charges in the quarter, which it expects will lead to savings of roughly CAD 250 million by early 2025. It also made some moves on its real estate footprint, which are expected to lead to savings of CAD 400 million. Combined, this should be another roughly 3% savings on the current expense run rate. The bank expects to achieve positive operating leverage in 2024, which we were already expecting, even on an adjusted basis. Because results are largely tracking our expectations, with the main difference being the one-time severance charges, we are maintaining our CAD 136/$100 fair value estimate. Results will remain a bit messy for now, but we expect the expense picture to improve throughout 2024 and into early 2025.","Growth and opportunities in the bank's U.S. markets will outweigh any slowdown in its native Canada as U.S. subsidiaries gain market share. Compared with its peers, BMO has a lower exposure to the Canadian housing market. BMO's presence in the Canadian ETF market should pay off as passive investment options gain share in Canada over the next decade.","The housing market in Canada is starting to heat up again, increasing potential risks for the economy and the banking sector. BMO's acquisition of Bank of the West increases execution risks and has created messy quarterly results which require a lot of adjustments that can be difficult to interpret. Higher interest rates and rising amortization periods for mortgages show the Canadian consumer is set to come under increased strain for the foreseeable future.",01/06/2023,"Bank of Montreal is the fourth-largest bank in Canada and one of six Canadian banks that collectively hold almost 90% of the nation's banking deposits. The bank derives roughly 60% of its revenue from Canada and 30% from the United States. BMO has a well-established Canadian banking presence, an established U.S. retail operation in the Midwest, and growing commercial and capital markets capabilities. It is also the second-largest asset manager among the Canadian banks as well as the second-largest ETF provider in Canada. BMO is not one of the largest or most dominant retail banks in Canada, as we rank it in the lower half of the Big Six. However, with its more commercially focused book, it boasts good share in its domestic commercial lending market, particularly for loans under CAD 25 million. Additionally, BMO has the lowest relative exposure to residential mortgage loans among its peers, helping to mitigate some of the risks in its loan book, although a true housing crisis could cause a recession and hurt commercial loans indirectly. Over the past several years, BMO has been building its commercial lending strength in the U.S., although we expect the consistent double-digit loan growth to eventually slow. In general, we like BMOs presence in the U.S., as it has built up respectable deposit market share numbers, generated material growth, and avoided some of the mistakes other Canadian banks have made in attempts to expand south. The bank's acquisition of Bank of the West closed at the beginning of February 2023. BMO has the second-largest amount of assets under management among the Canadian banks, with the largest proportion of its revenue coming from wealth-management fees among peers, close to 20%. We like the growth and results the bank has achieved here. Competing against BlackRock in exchange-traded funds will likely get more difficult, and RBC's latest partnership with BlackRock shows that competition will get tougher, however, we expect passive to continue to grow in Canada, supporting future growth for the industry in general.","With above-average historical operating efficiency, moaty nonbank businesses, and the ability to primarily operate in the favorable Canadian banking environment, BMO is worthy of a narrow moat rating, in our view. We award the bank a narrow moat rating rather than a wide moat rating because of its greater exposure to U.S. banking, which we view as less moaty than the Canadian operations, as well as its less dominant market positions within its own domestic market (where it has gradually lost share over the past decade to the larger Canadian banks).We argue that bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. We see switching costs within the Canadian system as driven by a tightly regulated oligopolistic market structure that limits excess competition, thereby stabilizing product pricing and giving customers less incentive to switch banks. We see cost advantages as stemming from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting, with regulatory costs being a final factor that must also be considered. We view the Canadian banking environment as offering systemic cost advantages for the banks under its domain. These advantages manifest in the form of lower operating costs, lower credit costs, lower regulatory costs, and lower absolute levels of and better diversification of risks, all of which allow the banks to achieve greater risk-adjusted returns.In our view, Bank of Montreal has a narrow moat because it has substantial, but not top, market share in the advantageous Canadian banking environment, slightly above-average operating efficiency over the long term, and exposures to several moaty nonbank businesses. Bank of Montreal does have fairly good share in the domestic commercial banking business, at number two for loans under CAD 25 million. However, for many of the other banking products in Canada, BMO is not usually the number-one or number-two player. Since the bank is slightly less dominant here, we believe it is more supportive of a narrow moat rating, rather than wide.Bank of Montreal had consistently operated with an average efficiency ratio for a Canadian bank, although in recent years this has not been the case due to several factors, including acquisitions, a legal settlement, and increased investment. We believe BMO will eventually return to operating efficiency that is closer to average, and while we dont expect the firm to be one of the most efficient Canadian banks, we do expect current investments in digital to pay off and some relief around increased regulatory expenses to dissipate and firmly support a narrow moat rating.BMO also has exposure to more moaty nonbank businesses, most notably its asset-management operations. Asset managers with scale tend to have moats, and BMO has the second-largest amount of AUM among the Canadian banks, and is the second-largest ETF provider in Canada (which tends to be a pure scale business). While BMOs focus on the ETF business gives it lower overall spreads, the scale advantage should endure and lead to excess returns on capital for a business that is not capitally intense. While BlackRock is the number-one player in Canada with nearly 50% of the ETF market, we see room for both players, even if BlackRock remains dominant. We believe the Canadian banking environment offers systemic cost advantages leading to returns above the cost of capital, allowing the main banks operating under its jurisdiction to possess moats. Barriers to entry for the Canadian banking system are very high. Existing regulations prevent foreign competition, as non-Canadian residents may not own more than 25% of the shares of a bank unless approved by the government (preventing foreign takeover), and foreign banks can only operate in Canada under certain restrictions (preventing significant direct foreign competition). Domestic competition is also controlled, as Canadas banking system historically developed to favor a few large banks controlling the majority of the domestic market, and this is actively enforced through the handling of chartering by the federal government exclusively. Additionally, the rejection of merger proposals in 1998 between Royal Bank of Canada and BMO, and between Toronto Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, created a precedent where the regulators will accept no further consolidation between the main Canadian banks. Having larger banks helps to spread out fixed costs across a larger operating base, increasing operating efficiency, as the four largest Canadian banks are all bigger than the largest U.S. regional bank. Because their branch networks are spread out through all of Canada, the Canadian banks arguably have some of the most powerful distribution networks within Canada. This offers cost advantages via lower customer acquisition costs. In addition, the banks are involved in nearly every major financial product, including asset management, wealth management, insurance, investment banking, and a variety of other consumer and commercial banking products and services. Bigger scale, powerful distribution networks, a multitude of products, and diversification of business lines lead to economies of scope in addition to the economies of scale already achieved.We believe a more protective and efficient regulatory system also leads to cost advantages, primarily through risk reduction. Less fragmented and well-integrated banking systems, like the Canadian system, have tended to be more stable over time, reducing risk. Also, the Canadian regulators must only primarily monitor and develop relationships with the Big Six Canadian banks, which is much easier than trying to monitor the thousands of banks which exist in the U.S., for example. This leads to more collaboration and cooperation between regulators and banks, as well as greater institutional memory and better-coordinated and more easily implemented responses if strains begin to appear in the system. Regulators also help to control pricing in the market at times, such as with mortgage products, helping to reduce the potential for pricing wars to gain market share at the expense of underwriting standards. Canadian regulation also makes it more difficult for bad credit to be issued in many ways, including mandatory insurance and standards on riskier mortgage loans, not having a government-sponsored enterprise like the government-subsidized mortgage securitization market, and forcing banks to hold more of the risk on their own balance sheets. These factors help contribute to better absolute risk reduction in the system, as well as regulatory economies of scale.The Canadian banks are also more geographically diversified on average than, for example, the majority of U.S. regional banks, which often have concentrations within individual states or local economies. This diversifies credit risk, lowering the overall risk for each individual bank. Canadas system of higher taxes, social safety nets, and undoubtedly other complex factors has also led to a more robust and stable middle class, which contributes to economic and political stability, further reducing systemic risk.With all of these factors combined, along with explicit government subsidies on deposit insurance and mortgage insurance, as well as the implicit subsidy of being too big to fail domestically (all of the Big Six Canadian banks are labeled as domestic systematically important banks), we see an environment where excess returns for banks are almost certain to exist in Canada.","Canadian banks face two primary risks: macroeconomic risks and risks related to future acquisitions. Canada has some of the highest median housing price/annual median household income ratios in several of its major housing markets, and mortgage debt levels have consistently increased for more than a decade. While low interest rates have kept debt-servicing ratios under control, this puts the economy in a riskier position as rates rise. We also see the leverage of the Canadian consumer as a risk, as consumers have slowly leveraged up for more than a decade. Bank of Montreal has one of the smallest exposures to the domestic real estate market in Canada, and we view this as a manageable risk for the bank.While there are uncertainties related to consumer debt levels and the mortgage market, we view them as a threat to future growth and not an existential risk to the Canadian banking system. Further, the Canadian banking system has historically been one of the more stable systems in the world, and is designed to protect industry profit levels and promote economic stability. As such, we assign our Canadian banks a Low Uncertainty Rating. We admit, with the rising mortgage risks, the banks are closer to Medium today than they were previously.From an ESG perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors which can come under more scrutiny at times. Commercials banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint and governance practices are in line with most companies.","We give BMO a Standard capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are standard, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We view the bank's current goal of 11%-11.5% as appropriate. We rate the company's capital investments as standard, as the bank has avoided value destroying products and expansions while pursuing sensible investments and growth opportunities. And we assess the companys capital return strategy, which is largely in line with peers, as appropriate, with a healthy focus on a dividend, and some additional earnings left over for share repurchases, after internal investments. Darryl White has been CEO since 2017. BMO, which had been shuffling around different senior management members, moved White to the COO spot in November 2016, signaling that he was the heir apparent to then-CEO Bill Downe. White has been with the bank since 1994 and has held many roles, including group head of the capital markets segment and CEO of BMO Nesbitt Burns, the Canadian wealth management arm of BMO.With White as CEO, we have seen a consistent focus on strengthening already-sizable U.S. operations; continued emphasis on the commercial operations of the business, digital and efficiency initiatives; and a further expansion of the ETF business. We've also seen a shoring up of the capital markets group with management changes and multiple acquisitions. Historically, we think the firm has done a good job of making acquisitions, particularly in expanding the U.S. business.We like that BMO has established respectable market shares in key areas in the U.S., and as such has remained profitable in these operations. The successful acquisition of M&I Bank in Milwaukee in 2011 added nearly $50 billion in assets, along with $162 billion in assets under management and administration, furthering multiple strategic objectives for BMO. We also like how the firm has taken advantage of its distribution strength and successfully expanded its wealth-management groups, while shedding its EMEA asset management segment where it lacked the necessary scale. While the firm is not among the most dominant of the retail Canadian banks, returns have consistently exceeded the cost of capital. Acquisitions have remained a key use of excess capital for BMO, and this could continue, although management has emphasized that it is pursuing organic growth first. With respect to the dividend, BMO was the last of the major Canadian banks to begin increasing it after the crisis and has now increased it multiple times since 2012. BMO did have to restate its own capital levels in 2016 after underestimating the amount of risk-weighted assets held on the balance sheet. It has since rebuilt its capital levels, and we believe the bank is well positioned to continue returning capital to shareholders or make further bolt-on acquisitions, and we think the acquisition of Bank of the West is likely to add additional growth for the bank.","Bank of Montreal is a diversified financial-services provider based in North America, operating four business segments: Canadian personal and commercial banking, U.S. P&C banking, wealth management, and capital markets. The bank's operations are primarily in Canada, with a material portion also in the U.S.","We see BMO as being in strong overall financial health and do not believe any potential future issues will be an existential risk to the bank. Given how leveraged the Canadian consumer appears to be, we expect that loan demand will remain modest, while risks will remain heightened. We are also concerned about a potential deflation of the housing bubble in Canada and the impact on Canadian banks. BMO has one of the smallest relative exposures to uninsured mortgages among the Big Six banks as a percentage of the total loan book, and as a percentage of tangible equity. In the event of a major downturn, we see the bank being able to deal with the fallout, although growth will decline and the damage will likely spread to the whole economy, damaging future earnings.The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% as of April 2023. In general, we find the bank's capital levels satisfactory with the targeted range of roughly 11.5% or more being appropriate. With dividend payout ratios at manageable levels between 40% and 50% under normal circumstances, we expect BMO's capital generation will continue to provide growth in its capital position, leaving room for future bolt-on acquisitions, increased capital return to shareholders, or both.",BMO.TO,Financial Services,81938522112.0,TOR,3283878.0,CAD,110.20999908447266,True,1,112.929285685225,125.10317072054025,1
24/11/2023,We Believe Oshkosh Is Well-Positioned to Benefit From Several Tailwinds,Oshkosh Corp,OSK,4,27/10/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,96.29,USD,23/11/2023,110.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,27/10/2023,"Oshkosh posted solid third-quarter earnings, leading us to increase our fair value estimate by nearly 7% to $110 (from $103 previously). We attribute nearly 6 percentage points of the fair value increase to the time value of money since our last update, with the balance coming from upward adjustments to our near-term forecast. We were encouraged to hear supply chains continued to improve, echoing managements commentary from last quarter. Recall, the company had to contend with rising inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies in 2022, which significantly pressured operating margins. Turning to the quarter, access equipment benefited from strong demand (sales up 27% year on year), largely due to increased infrastructure, mega projects, and industrial construction spending. We expect infrastructure spending to increase over the next few quarters. In addition, the average fleet age of access equipment remains elevated, which we expect will lead to replacement demand. This backdrop gives us confidence to forecast mid-single-digit sales growth in 2024. Defense sales continue to be challenged as expected (down over 3% year on year). Recall, that Oshkosh lost out on the joint light tactical vehicle contract recompete to AM General. Oshkosh will continue to supply the JLTV program for about another year. However, the company plans to sell the JLTV to international customers beyond 2024 (at lower volumes), which will slightly offset lost sales domestically. Were projecting mid-single-digit sales growth compared with 2023, which is shaping up to be an easier comparison period. On valuation, we believe Oshkoshs shares trade roughly 18% below our $110 fair value estimate. We think the market is anchoring on the challenges in the defense business. Our valuation takes into account longer-term opportunities in defense, for example, the U.S. Postal Service contract, which we think can somewhat make up for the JLTV contract loss.","Increased infrastructure spending in the U.S. and emerging markets could result in more aerial equipment purchases, driving higher revenue growth for Oshkosh. The U.S. Postal Service may elect to make follow-on orders, in addition to its initial 60,000 order. We believe this would provide strong revenue visibility over the next handful of years. The average fleet age of Oshkoshs emergency and commercial vehicles could lead customers to refresh their fleet with newer models, boosting the company's sales.","As a viable number-two player, Terexs Genie brand may lead customers to turn away from Oshkoshs JLG brand. The U.S. Postal Service could choose to hold off on making follow-on orders for next-generation postal vehicles. This scenario would limit Oshkosh's ability to mitigate the JLTV loss.  A weaker economic backdrop may force end users to hold off on replacing their aging fleet until construction activity picks up, pressuring Oshkoshs access equipment sales.",27/10/2023,"We think Oshkosh will continue to be the top player across its end markets. The companys enviable competitive positioning is underpinned by its ability to produce strong-performing products that exhibit high durability. Remarkably, Oshkosh has been able to replicate its brand strength in unrelated end markets, such as aerial lifts and commercial vehicles (military, fire, and emergency). Despite having very few synergies among its businesses, Oshkosh has been adept at implementing its technology across vehicle platforms.  Going forward, we think the companys strategy will largely be focused on driving product innovation and improving its aftermarket offering. In defense, Oshkosh has proved that it can develop innovative products for military customers. For seven years, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program was the go-to vehicle for the U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD. It essentially replaced the Humvee, showing Oshkosh's strong work in the defense segment. Research and development investments allowed the company to win the lucrative contract from the U.S. DOD in 2015. However, the company recently lost the recompete to AM General, the manufacturer of the Humvee. Based on management's recent comments, the follow-on contract was awarded to AM General mainly due to price. Oshkosh is not interested in becoming a commodity supplier in the space.  Finally, the company has exposure to end markets with near-term attractive tailwinds. In access equipment, the recently passed infrastructure legislation should create demand for its aerial equipment over the medium term. Many of its customers are construction companies, which are direct beneficiaries of increased infrastructure spending. We also think Oshkoshs aerial equipment benefits from a replacement cycle. Rental customers typically refresh their fleet every seven or eight years, setting up strong revenue growth in the near term. In our view, the companys emergency and commercial vehicle businesses will benefit from the replacement cycle. In defense, we expect the new U.S. Postal Service contract to drive steady sales growth as Oshkosh works to electrify U.S. postal vehicles. ","We assign Oshkosh a narrow economic moat rating based on the intangible assets present in its diverse set of businesses. For decades, the company has been a market leader in numerous end markets. Oshkosh has developed recognizable brands in aerial lifts, defense, and emergency vehicles, while its commercial vehicles compete in a highly fragmented industry, preventing us from assigning the business an economic moat. We believe Oshkoshs strongest segments possess brand equity with customers, given its ability to provide customers with reliable, high-quality products while offering customers a lower total cost of ownership. We also think switching costs are prevalent in the companys defense business, as its vehicles are mission-critical and long cycle in nature. With the fire and emergency business, customers are deeply entrenched with Oshkosh and are allowed to customize their fire trucks. These vehicles are major investments for municipal fire departments and the risk of product failures pushes customers away from unproven new entrants or smaller incumbent rivals. Oshkoshs JLG brand in the aerial lift industry is highly regarded among customers. JLG provides customers a full line of products, ranging from booms and scissor lifts to telehandlers. The JLG brand is the top brand globally, due to its high-quality products, strong residual values, and deeply entrenched relationships with rental companies. The rental vertical is Oshkoshs main distribution channel for its products in the access equipment segment, representing most of its customers. High concentration in the rental vertical may seem unfavorable as renters typically sell multiple brands, but we believe Oshkoshs relationships with rental companies lead to a mutually beneficial partnership. Rental companies find value (profitability) in selling customers the strongest brands, such as JLG. The rental industry is price competitive, but we believe end users will pay for value. The key considerations for end users when renting aerial lifts are product quality and availability. From a quality standpoint, customers are looking for highly functional (numerous capabilities) and reliable (safe) products to use on construction sites. In terms of availability, end users value the ability to rent equipment on short notice, sometimes within 24 hours from initial outreach. We also think the rental industry will see increasing rental penetration (customers increasingly choosing to rent rather than buying) in the near to medium term. Currently, the rental penetration rate in North America stands near 55% and we project it to reach over 60% in the medium term as more contractors forgo buying new equipment in favor of renting, ultimately driving down their project costs. By renting, customers can reduce their inventory of intermittently used equipment, eliminate maintenance costs, and save on storage and warehousing costs, leading to an improvement in their profitability. Our expectations for market growth will be a tailwind for JLG, as the brand will be in a strong position to capture greater market share gains than smaller competitors, thanks to its quality products and strong equipment availability. Oshkoshs technology-enabled aerial lifts improve safety and drive operational efficiency for customers. The companys aerial lifts allow customers to work at height safely in construction, industrial, and residential markets. Oshkoshs booms are embedded with technology that prevents dangerous tipovers (a valuable feature). In addition to safety features, customers value the range of motion capabilities that Oshkoshs booms provide. Customers can reach low-access areas without having to constantly readjust their base positioning. Increased platform capacity is another selling point as more workers and equipment can be lifted. Together, these valuable product features give Oshkosh a foundation to sell its booms at a higher price point, despite the competitive pricing environment. Moreover, the companys top market share position allows it to list products at higher price points in comparison to smaller players. In North America, we estimate Oshkosh and Genie (Terexs aerial lift brand) control over 60% of the market. The companys military vehicles are go-to products for numerous military customers globally. Oshkosh has a long history of developing vehicles for the U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD, and its allies (approximately 20 countries). These customers award vehicle manufacturers production contracts (becomes a key supplier of vehicles) based on product capabilities and pricing. Oshkoshs joint light tactical vehicle, or JLTV, was selected by the U.S. DOD in 2015 to replace the Humvee, which provides the company revenue visibility to mid-2015. Oshkosh recently lost the JLTV recompete to AM General (will hold the current program for at least five years), the Humvee manufacturer. Initially, Oshkosh expected to deliver approximately 18,000 vehicles to customers, which could have risen to nearly 55,000 (based on the companys estimates) over the next couple of decades if Oshkosh had won the recompete. Recall, military contracts are typically multiperiod, creating customer switching costs. That said, the company will now shift its focus to other combat programs, for example, the Stryker contract. In general, Oshkosh's vehicles exhibit intangible assets through their highly complex designs, from the suspension systems (effective mobility in off-road conditions) to its C4ISR solutions (vehicle network architecture). While the companys competitors have the capital to develop products to win military contracts, they outsource much of the design process. Oshkosh has built in-house design capabilities, allowing the company to be nimble enough to meet changing customer design expectations. The companys intangible assets and customer switching costs lead us to assign a narrow moat to the business. The main reason keeping us from assigning a wide moat on the segment is its high exposure to military vehicles, as opposed to the diverse product portfolios of many of its competitors, defense contractors. These players have attractive exposure to military planes and battleships. These product categories make up a significant portion of the military budget, whereas military vehicles are a lower priority. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Oshkosh has still developed a strong competitive position in military vehicles, benefiting from multiple lucrative programs. Oshkoshs fire and emergency vehicles are premium products, but its commercial vehicles face stiff competition. The companys Pierce brand offers customers a full suite of emergency vehicles, including aerial, pumper, rescue, and tanker fire trucks. The companys vehicles are some of the strongest performing and most durable in the industry. Ultimately, this has allowed the company to charge premium pricing for its vehicles, which in some cases reach seven-figure price tags depending on vehicle features. Similar to its defense vehicles, Oshkoshs fire and emergency vehicles exhibit complex designs (vehicle capabilities) and reliability (consistent performance) that are unmatched by rivals. Based on our estimates, the company has over 30% share in the North American market. Furthermore, Oshkoshs extensive dealer network offers customers strong servicing support. This has led to a strong aftermarket opportunity, as fire trucks can often be in service for decades. On the other hand, Oshkoshs commercial business operates in a highly competitive space, providing customers with concrete mixers and refuse trucks. While the companys three other segments have averaged high-single-digit operating margins over the past decade, profitability in the commercial vehicles segment has been challenged, averaging mid-single-digit margins since 2010. In our view, a key reason is the lack of differentiation when compared with peers. Oshkoshs concrete mixers and refuse trucks possess the same product capabilities as market alternatives. In addition, we believe it has been difficult for the company to develop an identifiable brand. The chassis of Oshkoshs trucks are usually supplied by well-known brands such as Mack, Peterbilt, and Kenworth. When the companys vehicles enter the secondary market, they are sometimes advertised as Mack refuse trucks or Kenworth cement trucks, not one of the Oshkosh brands that supplied the critical components. We do not think Oshkosh faces any substantial threats from ESG risks. The company has exposure to product safety issues and carbon emissions regulation, but we do not view them as material enough to include in our valuation. Product safety issues include both customer injuries while operating Oshkosh equipment and injuries suffered by the companys employees in the production of products. Carbon emissions regulation is increasingly a topic of discussion, but we think Oshkosh is already hedging against this risk through the development of next-generation products that reduce the carbon emissions of its products, namely its hybrid and electric-drive products. In its fire and emergency business, Oshkosh has seen increasing adoption of its hybrid ARFF vehicles, which are used at airports around the world. Customers can use the vehicles electric drivetrain to maneuver around an airport or switch back to the combustible engine to get to emergencies faster. The company is also developing its autonomous technology, specifically its unmanned ground vehicles for military applications. This work will allow military personnel to operate vehicles on the battlefield remotely.","We assign Oshkosh a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium.We believe that the most substantial risk to Oshkosh is declining investment in construction markets. We think recently passed legislation geared toward improving U.S. infrastructure will be the main growth driver. Many of Oshkoshs customers will be direct beneficiaries of increased infrastructure spending. Looking globally, we expect infrastructure spending in emerging markets to be relatively strong, as there is ample demand to build new roads and infrastructure to increase urbanization. However, a slowdown in economic conditions can quickly reverse investment in construction spending.Oshkoshs defense business also presents some uncertainty. Success in this segment is largely tied to the companys ability to win military contracts. In 2015, Oshkosh won the right to produce joint light tactical vehicles for the U.S. Department of Defense. The company recently lost the JLTV recompete, a significant setback. The loss is a prime example of how difficult it is to beat out other competitors that are working to build out their product capabilities. Oshkosh's competitors are very capable players, with enough capital to develop viable alternatives. However, we think the loss will be somewhat offset by Oshkoshs U.S. Postal Service, or USPS, contract that calls for new spending on last-mile delivery vehicles. Oshkosh faces stiff competition across its segments globally. In aerial lifts, its main competitor is Terexs Genie brand. Looking globally, China is a growth area for both brands, but local competitors pose a threat. End users in China typically adopt less sophisticated products than users in developed markets, giving Chinese players an edge. Oshkosh believes its more sophisticated products can gain traction in the Chinese market. However, we think it will be challenging for the company to convince end users in the region to adopt more sophisticated products.","We assign Oshkosh a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is fair and supports its competitive positioning. We also think Oshkoshs shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think Oshkosh has a sound balance sheet. The companys low balance sheet risk is largely due to its manageable debt levels and access to credit lines. We expect its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio and the number of debt maturities coming due in the near term to be relatively low. Managements net leverage target of less than 2 times over the economic cycle is achievable based on our expectations of strong free cash flow generation in a midcycle environment. Oshkoshs investment strategy is fair, in our view. Over the past decade, the company has largely relied on organic growth. Its market leading position in numerous end markets shows its products are some of the strongest performing and most durable. Oshkosh has developed a strong portfolio of products over the years, thanks to its investments in R&D. A prime example of this is the companys defense business. Oshkosh and defense contractors compete to win military contracts from the U.S. DOD and its allies. In order to win production contracts, all contractors must invest in their product portfolio to meet the desired functionality of customers. In the JLTV program, which has been pegged as the Humvee replacement, Oshkosh developed a heavily armored vehicle to improve the safety of vehicle occupants. From a safety perspective, the Humvee fell short (nearly half of the installed base was unarmored), creating the need for a light tactical wheeled vehicle that can protect military personnel in ground conflicts. Oshkosh recently lost the JLTV recompete, putting increased focus on its combat programs and the new U.S. Postal Service contract, which calls for the company to electrify the USPS fleet. Going forward, we expect more investments around electric-drive products, given managements commitment to investing in next-generation products that utilize zero-emission energy sources. This will ultimately drive efficiency in end users operations. In fire and emergency, we believe Oshkoshs ARFF vehicle is a viable hybrid-drive solution for emergency situations at airports. We think the company will see growing adoption in the long term, given its ability to reduce emissions. Customers can switch back and forth between the electric-drivetrain and combustible engine based on the vehicles objective. Similar to other medium and heavy-duty manufacturers, we believe Oshkosh will transition its commercial vehicles to electric drivetrains over the long term. Across vehicle types, we think the key challenge for manufacturers will be the weight and cost of batteries in electric trucks, as both factors can affect payload and functionality. As we highlighted earlier, Oshkosh has some attractive new contracts, such as its U.S. Postal Service deal. This call for the company to produce last-mile delivery vehicles for mail carriers. In our cash flow model, we assume Oshkosh will spend roughly $300 million in new investments in 2023. The majority of new spending will be focused on the USPS deal, but the balance will be concentrated on capacity additions for its emergency and commercial businesses.Oshkosh is already proving it can move into adjacent markets. The company recently announced its acquisition of AeroTech for approximately $800 million. AeroTech possesses a portfolio of airport products, such as jetway bridges, cargo loaders, and deicers. The deal will allow Oshkosh to benefit from growth in the aviation market, thanks to stronger air passenger traffic and new U.S. infrastructure spending. We're growing more comfortable with Oshkosh's future without the JLTV contract. We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. Historically, Oshkosh has been equally focused on buying back shares and paying out dividends to shareholders. Were confident in the companys ability to repurchase additional shares and increase its dividend based on our expectations of solid free cash flow generation throughout the economic cycle. In a midcycle environment, we expect free cash flow to be over $400 million.","Oshkosh is the top producer of access equipment, specialty vehicles, and military trucks. It serves diverse end markets, where it is typically the market share leader in North America, or, in the case of JLG aerial work platforms, a global leader. In recent years, the company has manufactured joint light tactical vehicles, or JLTV, for the U.S. Department of Defense. However, Oshkosh recently lost the JLTV recompete, bringing its U.S. Postal Service contract into focus, which calls for the electrification of U.S. postal vehicles. The company reports four segmentsaccess equipment (48% of revenue), defense (26%), fire and emergency (13%), and commercial (13%)and generated $8.3 billion in revenue in 2022.","Oshkosh maintains a sound balance sheet. Total debt stood at $597 million in the third quarter of 2023, which is roughly where it has been over the past decade. We dont expect Oshkosh to increase its debt levels, as management looks to be set on keeping its net leverage ratio under 1 turn for the foreseeable future. By pursuing small tuck-in deals, we think Oshkosh can expand its product capabilities without stressing its balance sheet. Oshkoshs strong balance sheet gives management the financial flexibility to run a balanced capital allocation strategy going forward that mostly favors organic growth and returns cash to shareholders. We think Oshkosh can generate solid free cash flow throughout the economic cycle. By our midcycle year, we forecast the company to generate over $400 million in free cash flow, supporting its ability to return free cash flow to shareholders. Oshkoshs capital allocation strategy includes both dividends and buybacks. The company began paying out a dividend in 2014 and has steadily increased it over time. With respect to repurchases, Oshkosh has returned $1.9 billion to shareholders since 2010. We expect more of the same from management, in addition to a greater focus on tuck-in deals to acquire new product capabilities. In terms of liquidity, we believe the company can meet its near-term debt obligations given its record of strong cash on hand. That said, the companys cash position as of the third quarter stood at $106 million. Recall, Oshkosh tapped cash on hand to pay for the AeroTech acquisition.

24/11/2023,Yum Brands' Digital Acuity and Value Orientation Should Position It Well Despite Tough 2024 Backdrop,Yum Brands Inc,YUM,4,01/11/2023,Sean Dunlop,128.94,USD,23/11/2023,139.0,Low,Wide,Standard,A,01/11/2023,"Wide-moat Yum Brands reported third-quarter earnings roughly in line with our forecasts, and we came away encouraged by the firm's positioning against a tough restaurant industry backdrop. With nothing emerging from the report that changes our long-term expectations for mid-single-digit annual growth in sales, high-single-digit annual growth in operating profit, and low-double-digit growth in diluted EPS, we expect little change to our $139 fair value estimate and continue to view shares as attractive. Were also lowering our Uncertainty Rating to Low from Medium for the name, consistent with our quantitative methodology. Yum posted $1.71 billion in sales and $1.44 in adjusted earnings per share, slightly missing our $1.77 billion top-line estimate but comfortably clearing our $1.27 EPS forecast. Consistent with recent quarters, momentum was driven by KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which together posted 13% system sales growth. We noticed a few chinks in the armorKFC U.S. and Pizza Hut U.S. saw roughly flat comparable store sales (0% and 1%, respectively)but remain broadly encouraged by the operator's ability to defend top-line momentum despite declining traffic industrywide, particularly in the United States. To this effect, Taco Bell U.S. purportedly saw 2%-3% increases in guest traffic across income cohorts, which augurs well for 2024, a year in which we expect negative restaurant traffic in the U.S. as consumers continue to rationalize discretionary spending. Finally, the firm's digital investments continue to bear fruit, with its unified global commerce platform setting it up to derive global benefits from its access to cross-brand consumer data. The company saw 45% of sales come through digital channels during the quarter, and with an emphasis on increasing global kiosk penetration and rolling out loyalty programs, we expect it to start to benefit from personalization, improved pricing, and better inventory management through its ""AIM"" software.","Better-than-expected international portability in the Taco Bell segment could offer upside from management's 5% average annual unit growth target. Geographic diversification reduces system sales volatility, with 60% of revenue generated outside the U.S. market. Strong international partnerships and brand portability position Yum well to take advantage of growing consumption classes in attractive markets like Indonesia, Thailand, and China.","Difficulties repositioning the menu could pressure Yum's restaurants' value propositions as consumers demand healthier choices. A struggling Pizza Hut brand could fail to generate durable comparable-store sales growth, pressuring store-level economics and curtailing that segment's unit growth aspirations. Developing supply chain infrastructure, growing consumption classes, and an increase in viable franchise partners abroad could erode Yum's first-mover advantages as Western brands look to expand into international arenas.",01/11/2023,"The restaurant industry has changed a lot over the past three years. We remain encouraged by the ability of the largest operators, including Yum Brands, to accelerate critical investments in e-commerce platforms, delivery integration, and technological solutions that meet the demands of the modern restaurant consumer. Recent acquisitions demonstrate the emphasis the firm has placed on digital enhancements, with 45% of systemwide sales now coming through digital channels, which we expect to remain integral to Yum's strategic playbook. Yum's competitive strategy has evolved in recent years, with the firm restructuring its corporate operations along brand rather than geographic lines after the spinoff of its China unit in 2016. Today, Yum's priorities include strategic menu development, ease of access, and distinctive brand identities. These pillars reinforce the strength of Yum's family of brands, driving our forecast for low-single-digit comparable sales growth across the portfolio. While the competitive picture remains dynamic, the firm's continued investments in international expansion appear well placed and underpin management's high-single-digit systemwide sales growth forecast, with our 7% estimate through 2027 falling toward the lower end of that guidance as competition for international growth intensifies. We note Yum's turnaround efforts with Pizza Hut point to one of the shortcomings of a nearly fully franchised model: the difficulties associated with hefty capital investments required for meaningful brand repositioning. The bankruptcy of Pizza Huts largest franchisee in 2020 marked the culmination of a turbulent couple of years for the banner, though more profitable delivery-oriented formats, investments in mobile order and delivery capabilities, and better capitalized franchisees could prop up the brand in the medium term. The banner generated positive unit growth in each of the last nine quarters after more than 1,000 net store closures in 2020, offering a nice green shoot for patient investors, but a still-sizable legacy footprint and tepid comparable-store sales will drag on near-term growth, in our view.","An ever-competitive restaurant industry and constantly shifting consumer preferences make carving out an economic moat difficult, but we believe that Yum Brands portfolio of relevant, distinctive, segment-leading brands and a scale-driven cost advantage provide an enduring competitive edge, consistent with a wide economic moat rating. Despite increased category competition, shifting consumer health preferences, and the democratization of restaurant technology, Yums brands have been able to consistently generate positive comparable sales growth over the last five years, leaving aside pandemic-induced downturns. In our view, Taco Bell and KFC (the largest players in the limited service Latin and chicken categories, respectively) maintain brand intangible asset and cost-driven moats, demonstrated by recent pricing power, impressive unit-level growth (reflecting attractive underlying unit economics), international portability, and a scale-driven procurement cost advantage. Despite competition from Western brands, particularly from Chick-fil-A and Popeyes in the U.S., and local competitors, we think exclusive franchisee relationships, slowly changing consumer preferences, and ample room for greenfield development in emerging markets should permit ongoing economic value creation at the parent level, with our 10-year average return on invested capital forecast of 45% (including goodwill) healthily exceeding our weighted average cost of capital estimate of 7%, though those figures are largely a byproduct of a heavily franchised operating model.Underpinning our wide moat rating are the firms brand intangible assets, with strong brands driving same-store sales growth above inflation, while international results further attest to strength. Comparable sales at both KFC and Taco Bell have been impressive, with median annual growth of 3.5% and 4.7% during the past five years suggesting that each brand has been able to raise prices and attract customers despite heightened competitive pressure, including during a very difficult 2016, when industry price competition spiked. The firm's brand portfolio has also proved remarkably internationally portable, with roughly 60% of systemwide sales generated outside the U.S.approximately $41 billion in 2022. Portable concepts and attractive unit economics have positioned Yum well to develop relationships with franchise partners, pushing higher unit and systemwide sales growth and reaching critical mass in new markets more quickly. While international markets are attractive for their ability to drive the unit growth narrative, they can also be quite lucrative for brands able to weather the lean early years of supply chain development, site selection, and customization to local tastes. KFC China earned mid-20s operating margins in the divisions early years, pointing to the importance of early market penetration and expansion into lower-tier cities and rural areas; now a low- to mid-teens percentage of operating income comes from the firm's royalty agreement with wide-moat Yum China.Considering KFC, we believe that managements decision to channel investment toward higher-return international units represents fiscal discipline and underpins the brands outperformance. KFC remains the primary top-line driver in the Yum portfolio, generating $1.2 billion in operating profit on $2.8 billion in revenue in 2022; this represents more than half of the firms operating profit and impressive mid-40s operating margins. While low-teens restaurant margins and higher buildout costs have slowed the firms domestic growth, strong results abroad make investments by third parties a more alluring proposition. As a result, the brand has generated annual unit growth of 5.3% since 2018, with comparable sales growth and productivity enhancements leading to system sales increases in the mid- to high single digits. Investments in a new e-commerce platform should help KFC to remain relevant in a world of increasing consumer expectations, defending the brands position as consumers demand omnichannel ordering capabilities, customization, and loyalty perks at the speed of want. The brands comparable sales growth has consistently outpaced inflation while outperforming the global limited-service competitive set in four of the last six years since 2016particularly impressive given the negative impact from sales transfers as accelerated store openings cannibalize sales from existing units (which is not a bad thing, to the extent that service improves). We do expect more acute pressure from increasingly viable international category competitors like Popeyes or Jollibee to slow KFC's growth in the medium term, while Chick-fil-A continues to outperform the banner in its home market of the U.S. by a wide margin. Nevertheless, a durable international growth narrative and competitive enough cash-on-cash returns should cement robust profitability at the franchisor level, in our view.Taco Bell is just starting to push international expansionone of our measures of brand strengthwith roughly 10% of its stores located outside the U.S. It scores very well in all other restaurant moat determinants: pricing power, unit-level profitability, and franchisee relationships. Taco Bell remains the only brand in the Yum portfolio consistently growing domestic market share. It benefits from rock-bottom food costs and a proliferation of alternative format stores (often featuring proportionately lower rents), allowing the Mexican chain to earn robust restaurant margins in the low to mid-20s. Taco Bells ability to generate excitement through menu innovation and promotional items, mixing as high as 10%-20% of sales, has rendered it quite popular with the millennial and Gen Z audience, while expansion in adjacent dayparts, like breakfast, has allowed the firm to push franchise average unit sales as high as $1.8 million in 2022. Finally, we anticipate that the firms commanding share in the Latin American limited-service market and limited overlap with its largest fast-casual competitor should moderate irrational promotional activity, allowing Taco Bell to preserve margins moving forward. Given its scale-driven cost advantage, we believe that persistent discounting by competitors like Del Taco and Qdoba is unlikely, with Taco Bell able to match or exceed price cuts while maintaining higher margins than lookalike peers. Further, we perceive limited overlap with wide-moat Chipotle's customer base, suggesting that the late-night concept's star should continue to shine brightly with very limited direct competitive pressure.We view the Pizza Hut unit as a no-moat segment, though we anticipate that it will continue to provide excess returns (quantitatively) at the parent level to the extent that franchisees remain solvent, given very low capital requirements in a 99% franchised structure. While managements emphasis on smaller delivery- and digital-oriented units are moves in the right direction, an inability to gain traction following the 2017 turnaround agreement does leave us skeptical. Pizza Hut saw 8 of 12 subsequent quarters result in flat or declining comparable sales following the investment, a far cry from results seen with similar efforts at KFC in 2015, leading us to infer that the Pizza Hut brand may be impaired. Weak company-owned restaurant-level margins of 4.9%, 0%, 5.6%, 3.9%, 6.8%, and negative 2.2% between 2017 and 2022 corroborate this view, curtailing franchisee interest in the firm's U.S. market, which still accounted for 41% of brand sales at year-end 2022. The bankruptcy of the firms largest franchisee, NPC International, also points to deteriorating unit economics, as Pizza Hut represented 75% of the operator's restaurant portfolio. Results from competitors do little to assuage our concerns, with Dominos and Papa Johns enjoying nearly 20% restaurant-level margins during the halcyon days of pizza quick-service restaurant growth.We believe that Yum Brands boasts a scale-driven cost advantage, with its Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions co-op leveraging the purchasing power of a conglomerate with $59 billion in systemwide sales in 2022 (second only to McDonalds among restaurant chains, which had $116 billion). The firms scale allows it to command favorable pricing on commoditized food items in its basket, including chicken, beef, cheese, flour, and tomatoes, while offering the capability to invest heavily in its brands (with advertising revenue of $1.7 billion from franchisees in 2022), technology (including a point-of-sale tablet ordering system at Taco Bell and an e-commerce platform for KFC), and strategic acquisitions. Further, we believe that the largest QSR operators benefit from favorable commissions on third-party marketplace providers, such as Grubhub or Just Eat Takeaway, as their presence drives volume to the platforms and exposes QSR customers to more profitable (for the marketplace) independent restaurants. To this effect, wide-moat McDonald's agreements with narrow-moat DoorDash and Uber Eats see just low- to mid-teens commissions. Ultimately, we believe that Yum's cost edge dulls the pain from periods of hard discounting and intense industry competition, underpinning our wide-moat assessment and shoring up restaurant margins.","We've lowered Yum Brands' Uncertainty Rating to Low from Medium, consistent with our quantitative Uncertainty Rating methodology.The restaurant space remains intensely competitive, marked by frequent discounting, quickly evolving consumer palates, and heavy fragmentation. Nevertheless, Yum's suite of brands (KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and The Habit Burger Grill) have proved quite resilient, and the combination of value-oriented fare, a heavily franchised system, and diversificationacross concept and geographyunderpin stable cash flows for the franchisor.Yum franchisees remain exposed to risks consistent with other restaurant operators in our coverage, including input cost inflation, unemployment rates, and price increases in nondiscretionary spending categories like healthcare and housing, which most frequently affects Yum's results through franchisees' appetite for opening new units. At the corporate level, the firm remains sensitive to foreign currency rates, particularly the renminbi (with China accounting for roughly 14%-15% of Yum's operating income in a normal year), as some 60% of system sales are generated internationally before royalties are remitted to the Kentucky-based parent at prevailing exchange rates. The firm also experiences a degree of balance sheet risk, as hefty interest payments limit flexibility during downturns while carrying leverage and interest coverage requirements.Yum remains moderately sensitive to supply chain and food safety, which is likely its largest environmental, social, and governance risk, with a spate of high-profile issues (the red dye incident in 2005, avian bird flu in 2012-13, the Husi/OSI sales of expired meat) seeing system sales growth decline to negative 1%, 0%, and 1% in 2013-15, respectively, in the China division after 23% growth in 2012.","We give Yum Brands a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, with its strong balance sheet, recent digital investments, acquisition of The Habit Burger Grill, and appropriate distribution philosophy informing our opinion.Yum maintains a capital-light model, with 98% franchised restaurants across its system following the spinoff of Yum China in 2016. As a result of more stable cash flow and fewer capital expenditure requirements commensurate with gross revenue-based royalty receipts, Yum has increased its leverage target to 5 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA, which appears appropriate when considering its business model. The firm comes close to maximizing the tax benefits of interest deductibility while maintaining ample flexibility to pay a competitive dividend (targeting a 50%-60% payout ratio), invest in technology and new equity units, and service its debt, which equated to roughly one fourth of precharge operating income during 2022. Free cash flow generation is robust, with our forecast for free cash flow to the firm averaging 26%-27% of revenue through 2027, suggestive of a healthy balance sheet.The firm's recent investments have primarily been channeled toward brand revitalization and digital integration, with the acquisitions of Collider, QuikOrder, Kvantum, Tictuk, and Dragontail designed to provide a seamless, customized ordering experience for customers. While our philosophy is that technology in and of itself is unlikely to underpin a moatgiven the widespread availability of omnichannel ordering and POS capabilities through nimble software-as-a-service providersit can allow a firm to control its own customer data, which we view as moat-accretive. A new e-commerce platform for KFC and a new tablet-based POS system at Taco Bell are encouraging developments, with Yum reaping the benefits of both in the form of better same-store sales growth (increasing royalty receipts) and through franchise technology fees in some cases. We also appreciate the firm's acquisition of The Habit Burger Grill, with the chain filling a gap in Yum's portfolio that represents the largest global quick-service segment.Yum has also invested internally in recent years, with a $185 million acceleration agreement with KFC franchisees (including investments in equipment and incremental marketing) helping to catalyze a run of 16 straight quarters of comparable-store sales growth prior to 2020. A similar effort at Pizza Hut (the $130 million transformation agreement) failed to spark a similar turnaround, though the results are obfuscated by the rightsizing of the store footprint, as delivery-oriented units and traditional casual dining units tend to see a mid-single-digit difference in comparable-store sales growth each quarter. Though these two arrangements are encouraging, as brands tend to require periodic repositioning and remodeling to remain fresh in the eyes of consumers, Yums capital-light model shifts the bulk of brand investments to operators, resulting in a preference for and perhaps dependence on well-heeled franchisees (like Flynn Restaurant Group, which operates both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell units) that have the financial wherewithal to support store remodels, incremental marketing expenditures, and expansion initiatives.We view the firms distribution philosophy as appropriate and model some $10.5 billion in capital returns between share buybacks and dividends over the next five years. The firm prioritizes investments in its store footprint and technology stack (capital expenditure), followed by maintenance of its dividend, using residual cash flow to repurchase shares.","Yum Brands is a U.S.-based restaurant operator featuring a portfolio of four brands: KFC (27,760 global units at year-end 2022), Pizza Hut (19,034 units), Taco Bell (8,203 units), and The Habit Burger Grill (346 units). With $59 billion in 2022 systemwide sales, the firm is the second-largest restaurant company in the world behind McDonalds ($116 billion), ahead of Restaurant Brands International ($39 billion) and Starbucks ($27 billion). Yum is 98% franchised, with the largest franchisee, Yum China, spun out in 2016 (after which Yum China agreed to pay 3% royalties to Yum Brands in perpetuity). Yum is the newest evolution of Tricon, formerly a division of PepsiCo, and generates the bulk of its revenue from franchise royalties and marketing contributions.","Yum has moved to a nearly entirely franchised model following the spinoff of Yum China in 2016, substantially reducing cash flow uncertainty and resulting in strong free cash flow to the firm averaging 26%-27% of sales per year through 2027, by our estimates. Though the firm maintains lofty net leverage, averaging 5.5 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA over the past three years (inclusive of operating leases), this figure is consistent with the 4-6 times net leverage sported by other heavily franchised restaurant chains like Domino's and Restaurant Brands International. We estimate 4.5 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA in 2023, which is manageable, in our view, though we wouldn't be surprised to see the firm gradually deleverage over the near term against a backdrop of higher interest rates as it tries to optimize its cost of capital.Since restaurants often sport negative working capital balances, attributable to cash-based operating models that see receivables turn faster than payables, we believe that solvency, rather than liquidity, ratios are a more appropriate metric for analyzing financial health. With $10.9 billion in net debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2023, net debt/adjusted EBITDAR has come back in line with historical targets, down from a pandemic-induced high of 5.7 times at year-end 2020. Further, strong free cash flow conversion offers substantial flexibility, and we view Yum as an attractive capital-return play; we forecast 12% average annual dividend growth through 2027 and $10.5 billion to be returned to shareholders via dividend payments and share repurchases over that period.",YUM,Consumer Cyclical,35691618304.0,NYQ,1551936.0,USD,128.94000244140625,True,1,126.80105851117413,131.6743209273753,1
24/11/2023,Hawaiian Electric Suspends Dividend as Wildfire Liability Risk Increases,Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc,HE,3,09/11/2023,Andrew Bischof,12.7,USD,23/11/2023,13.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,D,09/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $13 per share fair value estimate after Hawaiian Electric Industries reported third-quarter earnings. Hawaiian Electric suspended its dividend in August. Management withdrew guidance for 2023. Our Extreme Uncertainty Rating remains unchanged. This is the first time investors have heard from management since wildfires occurred in Hawaiian Electric's Maui service territory in August. Investigations into the wildfires are ongoing with no time frame indicated on the resolution of those investigations. Numerous lawsuits have been filed by victims. Management noted it plans to defend itself against both liability and claims of negligence in more than 60 lawsuits naming Hawaiian Electric as a defendant. The litigation uncertainty will likely persist for years. As part of a multiparty effort, including Hawaiian Electric, the recently announced One 'Ohana Initiative set up $150 million in funds for Lahaina fire victims. To receive funds from the initiative. victims will have to waive their ability to receive monetary compensation through other litigation measures. The company's insurance providers will pay up to $75 million into the fund. The company has $165 million of total liability coverage. Management indicated that its access to the credit markets remains limited. During the quarter, the company drew down $370 million on its revolving credit facilities. This, combined with continued customer cash collections, should provide sufficient liquidity to meet near-term cash flow needs. Our Extreme Uncertainty Rating incorporates a wide range of possible outcomes, and we think investors should wait to gain clarity on potential fire liability before considering investing.",Regulation in Hawaii has improved with performance-based ratemaking reducing earnings volatility while offering opportunities for management to earn incentives.  Hawaii's aggressive renewable energy standards support HEI's plan to invest $2.1 billion through 2027. American Savings Bank's conservative loan book has resulted in lower loan losses than its peers. ASB's steady cash flows help support investment at the utility.,"Recent wildfires in Hawaiian Electric's service territory have significantly increased investor risk. If Hawaiian Electric is found responsible for the damages, shareholders will face years of uncertainty and the risk for significant losses. Relationships with key stakeholders are likely to remain strained for years, pressuring regulatory returns. The company operates two disparate businesses, utilities and a bank, which provide few synergies and can be confusing for investors.",25/08/2023,"Hawaiian Electric Industries derives approximately three fourths of consolidated earnings from an electric utility and the remaining from Hawaii-based American Savings Bank, a business mix unique among its utility peers. Shareholders will need to be comfortable with a wide range of outcomes due to potential significant liabilities from recent wildfires in Maui. The largest fire in Lahaina killed more than 100 people and destroyed 2,200 structures with an estimated cost of $5.5 billion, according to a damage report released in mid-August by the Pacific Disaster Center and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Plaintiffs will need to show that the utility was negligent or could have reasonably prevented a loss. HEI's base allowed return on equity is 9.5%, though returns are likely to be much lower during the transition to the new ratemaking. For 2022, returns were just 8.2%. Even if Hawaiian Electric is found not liable for the Maui fires, we think returns will be below allowed returns during our forecast. American Savings Bank provides low-cost capital for the utility. The bank has a history of maintaining a low risk profile and strong balance sheet.","HEI owns a difficult-to-replicate network of power generation and distribution assets that provide essential electricity service to customers. In exchange for a mostly monopolistic position, regulators set the utilitys electricity rates.For the most part, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission has recognized the need for shareholders to earn an adequate return on investment. We think the new performance-based ratemaking supports our view that Hawaii utility regulation is constructive.This regulatory construct will be put to the test following the wildfires as HEI will need to work with regulators to ensure it remains a viable utility that is able to access capital and provide a fair return to shareholders.","We give Hawaiian Electric Industries a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Extreme.Our rating is driven by the wide range of potential outcomes for Hawaiian Electric given the potential that the company could be found liable for damages from the mid-August wildfires across its service territories. Current estimates for potential structural damages are greater than $5.5 billion and could go materially higher. An amount that high would likely lead to little or no value to the electric utility, with the remaining value attributed to American Savings Bank. Hawaiian Electric is exploring restructuring options, according to news reports. A restructuring could increase the range of potential outcomes.","We assign Hawaiian Electric Industries management a Standard Morningstar capital allocation rating.Management's success in improving the utilities' regulatory framework, which for the most part decouples earnings from usage trends, is a positive for shareholders. The new performance-based ratemaking framework became effective in 2021. Management will need to work with regulators to seek timely recovery of any costs associated with wildfires across the utility's service territory. While we like management's conservative approach at American Savings Bank, it can distract from the core electric utilities business. The bank has provided a steady, low-cost source of funds to support the utility's investment program. However, this could prove challenging in a higher interest-rate environment as higher funding costs pressure the net interest margin.Management must assure key stakeholders that the utility mitigated the risk of wildfires in its service territory to minimize potential liabilities. Management will need to work to regain key stakeholder trust.HEI president and CEO Scott Seu replaced longtime executive Constance Lau in 2022. We think Seu, who most recently was president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric, was a good choice. ","Hawaiian Electric Industries is the parent company of three Hawaii-based regulated utilities and Hawaii's American Savings Bank. The utilities provide electricity on the five islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai. Nearly 40% of electricity in its service territory comes from renewable energy; this portion is growing rapidly as the state has set a goal of 100% by 2045.","The company had more than $140 million in cash and cash available at the end of the second quarter. In late August, Hawaiian Electric drew down all $170 million and $200 million from two revolving unsecured facilities.In addition to ongoing cash collection from current customers, we think Hawaiian Electric has sufficient liquidity to meet near-term cash flow needs as the company rebuilds infrastructure damaged by wildfires and supports current operations. Longer term, Hawaiian Electric will need access to the capital markets to maintain its allowed capital structure and fund future capital needs. Also in late August, Hawaiian Electric suspended its dividend to preserve cash for wildfire- infrastructure repairs and potential liabilities. We don't assume a dividend in our five-year forecast.

25/11/2023,AI Innovation Supports Salesforces Wide Moat Even As Margins Expand Rapidly,Salesforce Inc,CRM,3,31/08/2023,Dan Romanoff,223.84,USD,23/11/2023,255.0,High,Wide,Standard,A,31/08/2023,"Salesforce delivered another good quarter with revenue and profitability ahead of our expectations. Based on quarterly upside and updated guidance, we refined our model toward slightly better profitability, and as a result we raise our fair value estimate to $255, from $245. We still see some upside from here for shares. For the fiscal year, Salesforce raised its guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Improved capital returns to shareholders in the form of share buybacks are driving share count down this year, as the firm repurchased $1.9 billion worth of stock during the quarter. Revenue upside was impressive in a subdued spending environment, but margins again stole the spotlight. On the flip side, growth continues to decelerate, even if the pace seems to have moderated, and professional services remain a drag on overall growth. Second-quarter revenue grew 11% year over year (11% in constant currency) to $8.60 billion, versus the high end of guidance of $8.53 billion. Like the last quarter, strength was driven by MuleSoft, a resilient core business, and a modest currency tailwind. Current remaining performance obligations grew 11% year over year in constant currency, which is consistent with revenue growth after being at a deficit for much of fiscal 2023. Professional services remain weak and the overall demand environment remains challenging. Management noted once again that eight of the firms 13 clouds had annual recurring revenue, or ARR, year-over-year growth of 50% or more. We see a path for margins to continue to expand even as the firm invests in near-term AI innovation. Profitability continues to shine, as Salesforce produced a non-GAAP operating margin of 31.6%, versus 19.9% last year and our estimate of 27.9%. The firm hit its goal of 30% operating margin three quarters early. While better revenue helped, the major restructuring actions from January 2023 provided margin support this quarter and should contribute similarly for the rest of the year.","Salesforce.com dominates the SFA space but still only controls 30% in a highly fragmented market that continues to grow double digits each year, suggesting there is still room to run. The company has added legs to the overall growth story, including customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and artificial intelligence. Management is likely going to focus on expanding margins after years of subscale profitability.","As the company grows larger, it may be increasingly difficult for Salesforce to grow faster than its various end markets. Salesforce has entered new areas via acquisition and has arguably paid material premiums in the process. Integration risk is real, as is the risk of increasingly large, dilutive, or ill-conceived deals. Despite its size, Salesforce has generated substandard margins in recent years, and its renewed focus on profitability may negatively affect already-slowing growth.",31/08/2023,"We believe Salesforce represents one of best long-term investment opportunities in software, particularly as the company should provide investors with a nice balance between revenue growth and improving profitability. Even as revenue growth has decelerated over time, we believe a new focus on margin expansion should continue to compound strong earnings growth for years to come. After introducing the software-as-a-service model to the world, Salesforce.com has assembled a front-office empire that it can build on for years to come, in our view. Sales Cloud represents the original salesforce automation product, which streamlined process management for sales leads and opportunities, contact and account data, process tracking, approvals, and territory tracking. Salesforces critical differentiator was that the software was accessed through a web browser and delivered over the internet, thus inventing the SaaS software delivery model. Service Cloud brought in customer service applications, and Marketing Cloud delivers marketing automation solutions. Finally, we think Data Cloud helps ties the offerings together. These solutions encompass nearly all aspects of customer acquisition and retention and, in our view, are mission critical. Salesforce Platform also offers customers a platform-as-a-service solution, complete with the AppExchange, as a way to rapidly create and distribute apps. We believe this further strengthens the substantial community of Salesforce users. In our view, Salesforce will benefit further from natural cross-selling among its clouds, upselling more robust features within product lines, vertical solutions, pricing actions, and international growth. Salesforce is widely considered a leader in each of its served markets, which is attractive on its own, but the tight integration among the solutions and the natural fit they have with one another makes for a powerful value proposition, in our view. To that end, more than half of enterprise customers use multiple clouds. Further, customer retention has gradually improved over time and is better than 92%, which we expect to grind higher still in the coming years.","For Salesforce.com overall, we assign a wide moat rating arising primarily from switching costs, with support from a network effect as well. Salesforce.com revolutionized the software industry in 2000 with the release of its salesforce automation, or SFA, application. The feature set was generally similar to those offered by peers: streamlined process management for sales leads and opportunities, contact and account data, process tracking, approvals, and territory tracking. Salesforce.coms critical differentiator was that the software was accessed through a web browser and delivered over the internet. Taken for granted now, this was a novel concept during the internet bubble. The company paved the way for the software industry as it exists now by first selling the concept of software as a service to prospective customers and then selling the actual SFA product. The SaaS business model, and Salesforce's SFA application, rose in popularity as customers were able to avoid high up-front costs and lengthy installations or potentially painful upgrade cycles, were always running the latest version, had more predictable operating expenses and capital outlays, and were running modern best-of-breed applications. Further, the SaaS vendors benefited from more predictable revenue streams, the elimination of piracy, and supporting only one product version. Thus, a new way to consume software was born, with all parties benefiting. Salesforce.com remains the clear leader in salesforce automation (Sales Cloud). The company has gone from no product to 33% market share over the last 20 years. Customers and industry observers alike view Salesforce.com as the clear front-runner in a category that increases the productivity of sales representatives. In other words, this is mission-critical software that helps drive revenue for users. We believe this segment enjoys a wide moat--indeed the widest moat as a stand-alone product among Salesforce.coms four cloud solutions. A variety of industry data points clearly indicate the Sales Cloud SFA solution is a best-of-breed solution, which by itself creates a certain amount of organizational inertia, as IT managers and executives engage in self-serving behavior. That is, they can jeopardize their own careers by pushing to switch from a leading solution that is functioning well and meeting their corporate needs. We believe customers are also reluctant to switch away from Sales Cloud because of the time, expense, and risk of implementing new applications and migrating data and the time, expense, and lost productivity of retraining the workforce on a new platform. SFA is a revenue-driving initiative and therefore is critical to users. The organizational risk of making a change is high, in our view. There is a school of thought that asserts switching costs are lower on SaaS software solutions. We do not subscribe to that position. While it may be easier to physically switch from one vendor to another in a SaaS model, the data generally do not show increased churn as the industry has shifted from on-premises perpetual licenses to cloud-delivered SaaS solutions. We attribute the lack of customer churn in SaaS in general to easier integration with existing applications and infrastructure, best-of-breed solutions, the time, expense, and risk of moving mission-critical data, and the retraining of the workforce to learn a new application. We think these same considerations drive highly recurring revenue for Salesforce.com. Along those lines, we believe the companys retention has improved modestly over time, from 88% to approximately 92%, but has remained relatively stable for nearly 20 years. In fact, nearly all other SaaS companies we have analyzed demonstrate similar such retention. The SaaS model, and indeed the companys initial SFA solution were both envisioned as an SMB product. As the company added features and continually honed the product and would-be buyers became more comfortable with SaaS, it evolved into an enterprise class product. As the original salesforce automation product added features, the use cases similarly grew. Salesforce.com ultimately separated out products into separate clouds (suites). The company currently offers four different clouds: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing and Commerce Cloud, and Salesforce Platform and Other. Salesforce is generally considered a leader in each. That said, the lines between the companys clouds are at times blurry, as similar features can be found in multiple clouds.In our view, Service Cloud is a natural extension of the Sales Cloud and is a clear example of two segments offering some similar features. Service Cloud includes a set of solutions aimed at helping an enterprise deliver customer service and support at scale. Customer service is another mission-critical function that directly helps a company attract and retain customers and therefore also is associated with driving revenue. We believe that Salesforce.com enjoys a wide moat based on switching costs here as well for the same reasons as its SFA offering. In addition to being a best-of-breed product, customers are reluctant to invest the time and expense of converting a critical revenue-driving function from one application to another, including the implementation and retraining of the workforce, in our view. We think the organizational risk is high for the revenue-driving function that Service Cloud covers. It is more expensive to find a new customer than it is to retain an existing customer. Salesforce.com discusses Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud as one segment for now likely based on the underlying size of each offering. As a business segment, it is the companys smallest and represents 15% of revenue. Marketing Cloud involves marketing automation, or the ability to create mass-customized cross-platform campaigns to targeted audiences, and by itself represents another natural extension of SFA. While we do not see Commerce Cloud as a clear add-on to SFA, we do see a more obvious relation to Marketing, as it enables an e-commerce engine driven by data and analytics. Digital Marketing is more dynamic in our view, as it is a newer category that has been somewhat fluid in its evolution as leading stand-alone products have become standard features of a good digital marketing platform. There are more contenders, a variety of point solutions, and no single clear leader. Adobes Digital Experience suite seems to have a narrow but growing lead, with Salesforce right there as well. IBM, SAS, Oracle, and SAP should be thought of as other leading competitors. The companys solution suite has been assembled less organically and more by acquisitions in a niche that has seen a wide variety of private and public company takeouts in the last decade. Key acquisitions for the company include ExactTarget, Buddy Media, Radian6, and a variety of smaller deals. As a stand-alone solution, Salesforce.coms Marketing Cloud benefits from a narrow moat driven by high switching costs, in our opinion. Again, the time, expense, and riskiness of migrating data and applications away from already leading solutions, along with organizational inertia, help keep customer relationships sticky. While we believe the companys overall moat is strengthened by offering Marketing Cloud alongside the other clouds, because it has been assembled largely by acquisitions in a niche that is rapidly evolving, we do not believe it has established a wide moat. Commerce Cloud is based on the July 2016 acquisition of Demandware and generates 15%-20% of the combined Marketing and Commerce Cloud. At the time of the acquisition, we believe Demandware was the leading independent platform that allowed customers to easily launch and manage multiple e-commerce sites, initiate marketing campaigns more quickly, and improve e-commerce site traffic. We believe Salesforce.com has since bolstered platform functionality. Like the industry that Marketing Cloud operates within, we believe Commerce Cloud is also a newer niche market that has evolved over the last several years. It is also the smallest market represented by each of the companys clouds. Because Salesforce.com moved into a young and evolving space with the acquisition of the generally strong Demandware platform, we believe it has a narrow moat supported by switching costs. Salesforce Platform and other includes the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft. MuleSoft slides into this segment naturally in that it helps customers solve a major pain point: integrating data and applications across platforms. We believe this segment enjoys a wide moat supported by high switching costs and a network effect. Application development platforms are sticky in that they serve as the core platform on which businesses and processes are built, and switching could be highly disruptive and expensive for developers. The company was early to the market with a cloud-based application development platform for customers. Use of the platform provided the low-investment benefits of a SaaS product, allowed for immediate and smooth integration with Salesforce.coms solutions, and also allowed developers to sell (or give away) the applications they developed on the companys AppExchange.The AppExchange was not just a novel concept at the time (it predated Apples App Store by two years), it was revolutionary and by itself was very enticing to developers. A variety of publicly traded companies started out as apps developed on the platform and initially distributed on the AppExchange. In the early years, the popularity of the SFA product attracted developers, Salesforce.com provided a robust and easy-to-use application development platform, and developers created additional applications often built as add-ons to various Salesforce.com solutions. We believe these dynamics allow Salesforce to continue to benefit from network effects. That is, as more customers adopt any of the companys solutions, the AppExchange provides an ever-expanding audience, which makes the AppExchange incrementally more attractive to developers, thus perpetuating a virtuous cycle. In our opinion, the strength of these clouds is important but should not overshadow the importance of all the solutions being offered under one umbrella by Salesforce. We believe customers value Salesforce.coms discrete clouds as stand-alone solutions, but the various clouds are highly complementary and are tightly integrated with one another, making the complete set of solutions more compelling. Customers are also looking to consolidate vendors. These factors combine to reinforce our wide moat assertion. As the company offers a wider set of related and best-in-class solutions, we believe it becomes more deeply entrenched in its customers as they adopt multiple clouds.","We assign Salesforce.com a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. From a big picture perspective, we believe Marc Benioff will be difficult to replace. He pioneered the software industry, co-founded the company, and led it to be a dominant force with a broad portfolio of sales and marketing related solutions.We believe the most important metric for Salesforce.com investors is revenue growth. Therefore, continued deceleration in the Sales Cloud, or growth that does not materialize as expected in Service, Marketing, and Commerce Clouds, or the Salesforce Platform would likely have an adverse impact on the stock in our view. To help drive growth, Salesforce.com has also been acquisitive. While we do not believe acquisitions have been transformative, the company has certainly made some larger acquisitions in order to help establish an immediate or larger presence in a particular solution. Investors have been concerned at times about rich valuations and organic growth prospects, as was the case with the Slack, Tableau, and Mulesoft acquisitions over the last several years. We believe the company is likely to continue to make acquisitions, and occasionally will pursue a larger deal. In these situations, valuation and integration will remain risks.Building on the acquisition-driven risks, Salesforce.com is likely to face new competitors as it continues to acquire its way into markets the company was not previously serving. The Demandware acquisition drove entry into a completely new area and brought a wide variety of competitors the company did not previously come across.While we do not see significant ESG risks, we note Salesforce faces strong competition for software engineers on the hiring front, and also faces risks arising from a potential data breach within its data centers.","We assign Salesforce a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think investments back into the business are most likely to be the key driver of total shareholder returns and are therefore appropriately prioritized over other capital returns such as dividends. That said, beginning in August 2022 the board authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program that has already been expanded, which we think investors will welcome.The balance sheet is sound with $12.5 billion in cash offset by $10.6 billion in debt, mostly from the Slack acquisition. Given the company's renewed focus on margins, we expect this debt level to be repaid relatively quickly and without any stress on Salesforce's financial position.Salesforces capital deployment strategy is evolving from reinvesting in the business and acquisitions to reinvesting in the business and share buybacks. The company does not pay a dividend, nor do we expect it to do so over the next several years.After spending 13 years at Oracle in various leadership roles in sales and product development, Marc Benioff cofounded Salesforce.com in 1999 with the end of software mission statement. In 2000, the company released the original version of its of salesforce automation product and offered it solely in a SaaS model. This delivery model revolutionized the industry, and 20 years after forming the company, while Benioff has yet to fully achieve his goal of ending the on-premises software model, it is clear he has steered the industry along the path he envisioned.Since its salesforce automation foundation, the company has greatly expanded its portfolio to include Sales cloud, Service cloud, Marketing cloud, and other areas such as platform, e-commerce, integration, business intelligence, and collaboration. While much development has been organic, Salesforce has completed many tuck-in acquisitions and several larger deals, including ExactTarget, Demandware, MuleSoft, Tableau and Slack. While we applaud the companys strategic acquisitions and focus on growth initiatives, the acquisition price has often been steep, with MuleSoft checking in at a staggering 22 times trailing sales. Further, the size of these larger acquisitions has grown, culminating with the 2021 acquisition of Slack for $28 billion. We think the time is right to shift away from its acquisition strategy.","Salesforce Inc provides enterprise cloud computing solutions. The company offers customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. Its Customer 360 platform helps the group to deliver a single source of truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps, and devices to help companies sell, service, market, and conduct commerce. It also offers Service Cloud for customer support, Marketing Cloud for digital marketing campaigns, Commerce Cloud as an e-commerce engine, the Salesforce Platform, which allows enterprises to build applications, and other solutions, such as MuleSoft for data integration.","We believe Salesforce.com is a financially sound company. Revenue is showing solid growth, while margins are expanding rapidly. As of January 2023, Salesforce had $12.5 billion in cash and investments, offset by $10.6 billion in debt, mostly related to the Slack acquisition, resulting in a solid net cash position. Gross leverage sits at 1.9 times trailing non-GAAP EBITDA, which we do not view as problematic given that we expect the company's free cash flow to grow rapidly in the coming years.Operating margins are increasing as Salesforce continues to scale and, for the first time, has emphasized profitability. Management expects rapid expansion of non-GAAP operating margins over the next several years. Further, Salesforce generated free cash flow margins in excess of 16% in each of the last five years, including 21% in fiscal 2023. We believe that margins should ultimately exceed 30% as growth slows and we appreciate managements more balanced approach between growth and margins.In terms of capital deployment, Salesforce is pivoting away from acquisitions in favor of share buybacks for the first time. We think shareholders had become increasingly frustrated with large deals, culminating with the 2021 acquisition of Slack for $28 billion. While the company just began share repurchases late in calendar year 2022, we think small tuck-in acquisitions will continue at a more moderate pace.",CRM,Technology,251679997952.0,NYQ,14428354.0,USD,223.83999633789065,True,1,211.4239997415012,276.7065429687506,1
25/11/2023,Infosys Narrow Moat Stable as Deal Pipeline Remains Robust,Infosys Ltd,INFY,3,12/10/2023,Julie Sharma,17.47,USD,24/11/2023,16.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,12/10/2023,"Infosys second-quarter results surpassed our expectations on the top line and came right in line with our EPS expectations, although the market was baking in a stronger EPS, hence the 6% drop in the stock price upon results. Despite the revenue beat compared with our expectations and those of the market, the company lowered growth expectations (on a constant currency basis) for the year. Nonetheless, we were already baking in more conservative top-line growth. We maintain our fair value estimate for Infosys at $16 per share. We continue to think Infosys moat sources are well protected and the firm will be prepared to bounce back once discretionary spending loosens up. Infosys second-quarter revenue grew 2.5% year over year, in constant currency, to $4.7 billion. The firms large deal total contract value, or TCV, for the quarter was $7.7 billion, which is more than double the amount from the prior-year period48% of the TCV was net new, marking a sequential decline from 56% in the first quarter. Still, we think the second-quarter net new TCV mix is promising for long-term top-line strength. Infosys operating margin of 21.2% marked a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior-year period, which we find unsurprising given the most hit discretionary spending tends to have higher profitability. Second-quarter diluted EPS of $0.18 was exactly in line with our expectations. Operation margin guidance for fiscal 2024 was maintained at a range between 20% and 22%. Nonetheless, Infosys lowered its revenue expectations for the full year to constant-currency growth between 1% and 2.5%, down from 1% to 3.5%, out of caution as discretionary spending on digital transformation projects remain muted. We think this is fair, as we were previously baking in depressed revenue growth for the year due to tight spending by customers in Infosys most burgeoning areas.","Infosys should benefit from greater margin expansion than expected in our base case as more automated tech solutions decrease the variable costs associated with each incremental sale. Infosys should profit from a wave of demand for more flexible IT infrastructures following the COVID-19 pandemic, as more companies seek to be prepared with the onset of similar events. As the European market becomes more comfortable with outsourcing its IT workloads offshore, Infosys should expand its market share in the growing geo. ","Infosys could suffer greater wage hikes than expected, leading to aggressive margin contraction if automation and mix shift benefits prove to be smaller in scale.  Infosys revenue growth could be more moderate than expected if the company fails to properly convert its intangible assets to applications to solve the latest enterprise tech needs. Amazon could start to delve into the greater IT services market, outside of IT infrastructure maintenance, leading to increased competition in the space. ",20/07/2023,"Infosys is a leading global IT services provider, with the typical menu of offerings from software implementation to digital transformation consulting to servicing entire business operations teams. We think Infosys merits a narrow economic moat, similar to many of its peers, as we believe the company benefits from switching costs and intangible assets, although we also see Infosys benefiting from a cost advantage. While the company is experiencing industrywide labor shortages, we think that its stable moat trend will stay secure, and forays into the higher value realm of industrials engineering will help ensure Infosys does not miss out on substantial growth trends within the IT services industry at large. While in many regards theres an uncanny resemblance between Infosys and its Indian IT services competitors, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Servicessuch as in its offerings, offshore leverage mix (near 75%), or attrition rates (near 15%)Infosys has pockets of solutions where it distinguishes itself from the crowd. For instance, Infosys digital banking solution, EdgeVerve, which serves approximately 17% of the global banked population, is considered number one according to several sources, including Forrester Research.  Infosys isnt unusual for being an IT services provider boasting switching costs and intangible assets. These are founded upon the intense disruption customers would experience when changing their IT services provider as well as Infosys specialized knowledge of the industry verticals it caters to and the distinct knowledge of its customers web of IT piping. But besides these two moat sources, we think that Infosys benefits more from cost advantage (which we only allot to Indian IT services companies) based on its labor arbitrage model. While we think benefits from such cost advantage will diminish over time as the gap between Indian wage growth and GDP growth in primary markets narrows, we think Infosys moat is secure as its foray into higher-value offerings and increasingly automated solutions offset this trend.","We assign Infosys a narrow moat, as we think Infosys benefits from significant switching costs, intangible assets, and cost advantage that all allow it to achieve significant excess returns on invested capital. Infosys is a leading global IT services provider, offering standard IT services offerings: consulting, managed services and cloud infrastructure services, and business process outsourcing as a service (BPaaS). In our view, these subindustries are generally primed for switching costs and intangible assets throughout the IT services industry. Additionally, we find that Infosys and its other Indian IT services peers are able to benefit from a cost advantage based on labor arbitrage that follows from its large base of Indian talent. Infosys depends on its software services offerings for the brunt of its revenue (94% to be exact), divvying up the segment into two spheres: digital and core. Infosys digital offerings include services to digitize and/or optimize and simplify current business process, such as those dealing with data, e-commerce, supply chain, or digital advertising. Infosys core services include offerings such as application management, application development, validation solutions, and product engineering and management. Infosys relies heavily on its existing customers for future revenue, with existing companies making up 98% of revenue in fiscal 2020 and 97% in fiscal 2019. We think this significant reliance on existing customers shows the strength of Infosys switching costs. Infosys provides application maintenance, implementation, and onsite infrastructure services. We think Infosys exhibits switching costs in these areas due to their mission critical nature. A company could bear immense costs if an enterprise software experienced significant downtime, suffered a poor software release, or a companys servers were not properly maintained or well balanced in terms of loads. These risks are increased if a client switches to a new IT services company to manage its infrastructure or applications, as IT services companies must understand all the nuances of infrastructure and applications within the context of how the client uses them and to which other channels they are connected, lending itself to a lengthy switch. Infosys offers BPaaS, infrastructure services, and digital engineering. We think all these areas exhibit switching costs. In business process outsourcing as a service (BPaaS), for example, offerings include insurance processing and HR administration. BPaaS is often a hearty extension of a companys operations that requires significant tailoring to a client's needs. BPaaS contracts tend to last several years, which we believe to be a function of the significant time it takes to adjust to a client's wants and needs, which could differ significantly from even a competitor in the same vertical. We think that switching costs also exist throughout Infosys' digital transformation consulting arm. Even though the length of these projects are shorter than Infosys other offerings, we still believe it is difficult for customers to switch over to another IT consultant for new projects, as these projects entail delivering often ambiguous outcomes, which therefore requires much trust. While Infosys products and platforms segment only accounts for 6% of revenue, we believe these offerings help drive business to software services, as they require maintenance, which helps the companys overall stickiness. The segment includes platforms from EdgeVerve (an Infosys fully owned subsidiary) like Finacle, which is used as a foundation for digital banking solutions for 17% of the global banking population and is considered the leading digital banking platform by both Gartner and Forrester Research. We think this segment exhibits significant switching costs, as is the case with most software offerings globally. Switching providers of software that is the backbone of a banks digital banking would be extremely time consuming and costly. Like many other IT services companies, Infosys relies first and foremost on the financial services sector for the brunt of its business (over 30% of revenue).Infosys has technical expertise gained from putting enterprise solutions to work across hundreds of companies and refining its solutions with every new deployment, a benefit we find often across the IT services industry. We think this moaty technical expertise is maintained and monetized effectively through the companys vast store of know-how as well as maintaining its talent, lending to Infosys narrow moat. Infosys has one of the lowest attrition rates of IT services companies in our coverage at 15%, compared with Cognizant and Capgemini, for example, which have employee attrition rates of 22% and 20%, respectively. This means that Infosys is better able to attract value from its intangible assets as there is less turnover of such assets, as this is retained significantly in talent. In our view, Infosys benefits from significant cost advantage from its salary arbitrage, with its large base of Indian employees, which allows Infosys to achieve attractive margins. While Infosys is not alone in such labor arbitrage, with Wipro and TCS among such peers, IT services companies that partake in such hefty labor arbitrage do pose a significant benefit, contributing to excess ROICS. We estimate Infosys has offshore leverage near 75%, which would be considered one of the highest in the industry, just after TCS offshore leverage, which we estimate to be near 78%. ","We consider Infosys to exhibit Medium Uncertainty, which is consistent with our India IT services coverage. When considering environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk specifically, we think Infosys' risk lies namely in its human capital. Given the extent of Infosys offshore leverage, estimated to be near 75%, we think the companys greatest risk is in a narrowing differential between Indias real wage growth and real wage growth in developed markets such as the U.S. We think this narrowing wage differential is a greater risk than any stricter restrictions over H-1 and L-1 visas in the U.S. because Infosys has made proactive moves over the past several years to derisk itself from such vulnerabilitiesby recruiting more and more U.S. employees (now at 10,000) and creating six U.S. ""hubs"" to attract talent as well as service clients and innovate. Currently, Infosys has nearly 14,500 employees in the U.S. on either an H-1 or L-1 visa. However, this makes up only 6% of Infosys total employee base of over 240,000. In comparison, we expect that Infosys benefits from an estimated 70% discount in Indias salaries compared with U.S. salaries. As Indias economy continues to develop, this wage gap may narrow and is possibly an even greater risk to Infosys than increased regulations. Nonetheless, we see such wage-gap narrowing as happening gradually over time, thus meriting a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating over a High one.Our uncertainty rating also considers the increasing complexity of enterprise IT and the risks of falling behind in such capabilities as well as perception risk that could cause distrust in the companys offeringsbrought upon by a security-compromising event, which is not uncommon in the industry. Additionally, like most IT servicers, Infosys is at risk of employee attrition. Increased attrition could cause wear on Infosys intangible assets, as less technical and industry expertise would remain in the firm.","We believe Infosys capital allocation is Standard, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and mixed shareholder distributions. Salil Parekh is CEO, and the nonexecutive chairman is cofounder and previous CEO Nandan Nilekani.We think Infosys balance sheet is sound based on its healthy cash cushion and lack of debt. Infosys had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. We think the firms investments are fair as positive economic value is likely to be added through managements investment decisions. Furthermore, we believe Infosys shareholder distributions are mixed, as dividends and share repurchases are not diverting R&D efforts, but shares are considerably overvalued, in our view, making share repurchases an unattractive use of capital at the moment.Our capital allocation rating is informed by our review of Infosys management. Infosys management team has faced some turmoil in recent years. Cofounder and former executive chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy came out of retirement in 2013 to help right the ship. His return resulted in improved financial performance, although it has been marked by numerous high-profile executive resignations. Murthy again stepped down and re-entered retirement to make way for CEO Vishal Sikka in August 2014. Sikka was a 12-year SAP veteran and was the companys first ever nonfounding leader. His appointment signified a greater emphasis on proprietary software product development and a shift away from increasingly commoditized outsourcing services.However, Sikka resigned in August 2017 after an ongoing spat with founders such as Murthy. Most notably, the founders had questioned a pay raise for Sikka, the size of recent severance payouts, and the strategic decision to acquire Panaya. Sikka said these constant distractions had impeded his ability to conduct important transitionary work and expand the business. As it stands, Infosys is at a crossroads where it needs to balance managing its core operations, which are aimed at efficiently run operations, while also investing in and expanding its newer software and services businesses that are focused on digital transformation initiatives. We remain cautious about the deep involvement of the founders and whether further meddling will act as an ongoing management turnstile. With Parekh as CEO as of January 2018, we believe top-level stability has been injected at Infosys, as well as a reconstituted board. COO Pravin Rao, who has been an integral part of the firm's digital transformation and acted as interim CEO and managing director, has stepped back down to COO. From a strategic point of view, we do not expect an abrupt change to Infosys' direction, given the overwhelming case for digital transformation services exposure. The company is focused on the future and not looking back to its roots in commoditized traditional services, which we think is positive. Parekhs focus seems to rest on digital transformation, along with upskilling the employee base and optimization across the company.","Infosys is a leading global IT services provider, with nearly 250,000 employees. Based in Bangalore, the Indian IT services firm leverages its offshore outsourcing model to derive 60% of its revenue from North America. The company offers traditional IT services offerings: consulting, managed services and cloud infrastructure services, and business process outsourcing as a service (BPaaS).","We believe Infosys financial health is in good shape. Infosys had nearly $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of March 2023 with zero debt. We expect that Infosys cash cushion will continue to remain healthy, as we expect free cash flow to grow to surpass $4 billion by fiscal 2028. This should allow for continued dividend increases, share buybacks, and acquisitions. We expect that Infosys will be able to grow its annual dividend amount on an absolute basis over the next five years. We forecast that share buybacks over the next five years will average at $470 million each year. Additionally, we assume that acquisitions over the next five years will average at $90 million each year.",INFY,Technology,73382338560.0,NYQ,4744409.0,USD,17.469999313354492,True,0,17.142941216875293,19.079999993491462,1
24/11/2023,Vulcan Is Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Infrastructure Spending Despite Housing Market Weakness,Vulcan Materials Co,VMC,1,27/10/2023,Spencer Liberman,211.9,USD,23/11/2023,154.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,27/10/2023,"Vulcan Materials reported third-quarter results that were largely in line with our expectations. Net sales rose almost 5% year over year, led by the strength in Vulcans aggregates and asphalt businesses. Consolidated gross margins continued to improve, expanding 340 basis points to 27%, largely due to robust aggregate pricing gains. Despite these gains, weak residential construction continues to weigh on Vulcans shipments and has shown little sign of improvement throughout the year. While infrastructure and nonresidential projects have buoyed volumes, softening nonresidential demand could create additional volume pressure. Nevertheless, we maintain our $154 fair value estimate. Vulcans aggregate business saw a 2% decline in shipments year over year, but this was more than offset by a 15% increase in freight-adjusted selling prices. Segment gross margins expanded 200 basis points from a year ago to 31.3%, largely due to the realization of midyear price increases. Higher mortgage rates continue to constrain both single- and multi-family housing starts, but Vulcan has benefited from an uptick in highway spending and relative strength in nonresidential markets. Given the current demand environment, we forecast that 2024 aggregate volume will be roughly flat year over year, but pricing gains will drive mid-single-digit revenue growth in the segment. Higher interest rates have weighed heavily on the housing market and constrained some of Vulcans aggregate shipments. Private nonresidential construction has held up better but has started to show signs of softening amid a higher interest rate environment and heightened economic uncertainty. Despite healthy state budgets and allocated infrastructure funds, infrastructure spending has yet to materialize into robust aggregate shipments. While we expect infrastructure spending will accelerate into 2024, there will be substantial ground to gain to make up for pullbacks in Vulcans other end markets.","Vulcan has a favorable geographic footprint in states that have a strong need for increased road work and the capability to fund it. Not-in-my-backyard tendencies make the permitting process incredibly difficult for new quarries, forming high barriers to entry and protecting Vulcans business from incoming entrants. Vulcans exposure to publicly funded infrastructure and repair activity has proved to be resilient during an economic downcycle.","Political partisanship and the desire to reduce government spending threaten the stability of publicly funding infrastructure projects. Vulcan increased its exposure to downstream materials through its acquisition of U.S. Concrete. This business does not benefit from high barriers to entry and yields lower returns.  Vulcans earnings depend on volatile outside factors such as U.S. economic performance, government budgets, and weather.",27/10/2023,"Aggregates producer Vulcan Materials is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing recovery of U.S. construction spending. We forecast strengthening demand growth for the public sector and modest growth for the private sector. Accounting for roughly 40% of shipments, public-sector demand is generally more stable, and projects, primarily highway construction, are more aggregate-intensive per dollar of spending. Federal funding power has weakened as better vehicle mileage and inflation have diminished the buying power of the $0.18 per gallon gasoline tax, unchanged since 1993. The FAST Act, passed in December 2015, provided stability and near-term funding certainty but did not solve the still-weakening gas tax. However, long-term federal funding was passed in late 2021, totaling $1.2 trillion.  The outlook for road spending differs considerably from state to state. Differences in population growth, road conditions, funding mechanisms, and overall state fiscal health influence spending. Vulcan's largest states by revenueTexas, California, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginiahave significant road spending needs and strong finances to support robust growth.  Private-sector demand consists of residential and nonresidential construction, including commercial and industrial properties. Nonresidential construction is the most important driver in the category, as spending is more material-intensive per dollar than residential construction. We expect nonresidential spending growth to moderate in the longer term, as we expect many key sectors to make more efficient use of their construction spending. Additionally, we expect residential starts to converge to our long-term housing starts forecast of 1.35 million by 2032. Residential construction historically supports nonresidential construction growth.","We think Vulcan Materials benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. We assign Vulcan a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and cost advantage. Vulcan is the largest producer of aggregates in the United States. The firm also operates a smaller asphalt and ready-mixed concrete business. The U.S. aggregates market is highly fragmented and composed of over 1,000 companies. Many of these firms operate small, local operations that pale in comparison to Vulcan. The low value/weight ratio of aggregates severely limits the range of deliveries and places an importance on quarry locations while permits remain difficult to obtain. Vulcan benefits from a regional transportation cost advantage over competitors whose quarries are located further away from highly populated areas. This advantage stems from the companys permits, which prevent significant increases in supply in Vulcans existing regions. The commoditized nature of building materials requires companies to possess cost advantages in order to reliably generate economic profits.Aggregates account for over 70% of Vulcans consolidated revenue and an even larger portion of the companies gross profits. Aggregates typically sell for $16 or more per ton, leading to an extremely low value/weight ratio. Given the lack of water or rail access at most quarries, more than three fourths of aggregates ship by truck. Transportation by truck costs roughly $0.15-$0.65 per ton per mile, limiting the potential range of deliveries to roughly 50 miles or less before transportation costs begin to outweigh the cost of the aggregate itself. Vulcans quarries tend to be located close to its customers in highly populated urban areas. Distant outside operators would need to subsidize their prices (lowering profitability) to encourage customers to incur higher transportation costs. With most aggregates producers lacking efficient water or rail alternatives, markets tend to be extremely localized, with high barriers to entry. The highly fragmented nature of the industry, which consists of many local markets and low market shares, is testament to the difficulty of transporting the product long distances.Vulcan benefits from its permits (intangible assets) that are difficult to obtain and make it challenging for competitors to open new quarries. Building material producers face extreme opposition from local communities in obtaining approval for quarries due to the environmental impact and noise pollution that production causes. Not-in-my-backyard tendencies make the permitting process difficult in developed markets and create a high barrier to entry. Once a quarry is present in a region, the likelihood of authorities permitting additional capacity is extremely unlikely. Furthermore, while populous metropolitan areas are the centers of construction activity, new quarry permits are difficult to obtain as a result of not-in-my-backyard tendencies. We think Vulcans competitive advantage is durable because we do not anticipate the importance of aggregates in construction diminishing, transportation costs to fall, or new quarry permits to become easier to obtain. Infrastructure projects are typically resilient during economic downturns as governments tend to fund projects through the cycle to support the economy and prevent job losses. Stable demand has supported consistent price increases through economic cycles and led to subsequent margin expansion for manufacturers. From 2007 to 2021, Vulcans price increases exceeded inflation in all but five years. During this period, the firm's price per ton grew over 90%, while inflation rose roughly 31%. Additionally, Vulcan only recorded one year of price contraction during this 15-year period. This is a testament to the firms durable pricing power, even during times of softer demand. During the most recent construction demand trough, the firm failed to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital as historical levels of construction led to a record slowdown in spending. Utilization rates took years in some areas to catch up with completed projects, which slowed recovery and weighed on Vulcans returns for multiple years. Since then, Vulcan has steadily grown revenue, selling prices, and returns as demand normalized.During the most recent construction demand trough (the period prior to the COVID-19 downturn), the company failed to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital. We think high capacity utilization will be necessary to generate excess returns. Because we do not have the confidence that demand will be strong enough to reach appropriate levels of utilization throughout the entire construction cycle, we refrain from assigning the company a wide moat rating at this time.We think downstream materials such as ready-mixed concrete and asphalt (byproducts of cement and aggregates) do not benefit from an economic moat. The low value-to-weight argument (cost advantage) does not hold since producers do not require permits (intangible assets) that prevent new entrants. For asphalt, 95% of the weight is composed of aggregates while aggregates make up roughly 80% of ready-mixed concrete. Essentially, aggregates are mixed with water and cement or liquid asphalt cement to produce ready-mixed concrete and asphalt. There are almost no barriers to entry for the mixing process, as anyone can purchase the inputs to produce concrete or asphalt. This creates a highly competitive market where participants compete on price. These products are also relatively commoditized, which results in these businesses generating lower profit margins than producers of upstream materials, which exhibit greater barriers to entry. It is worth noting that the production of cement and liquid asphalt cement benefit from strong competitive advantages that generally warrant an economic moat, but Vulcan purchases these inputs from third-party producers.","We assign Vulcan a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The biggest risk for Vulcan is weak construction, but risks differ among end markets. Compared with the private sector, public-sector construction is generally more stable because of its reliance on government funding. The most significant risk for public-sector construction is state and federal funding. The federal Highway Trust Fund is an important source of highway construction dollars, primarily funded by gas and diesel taxes. These taxes been unchanged since 1993, with no inflation or fuel efficiency adjustment. Improving vehicle mileage and reduced driving add pressure to funding. The risk was muted by the passing of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in late 2021. This is a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill with approximately $110 billion going to roads, bridges, and major projects. While we expect some near-term volatility in private-sector spending, specifically in residential construction, the 2021 infrastructure bill should provide strong public sector demand. Vulcan is exposed to some environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of its products and services and carbon emissions from its operations. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. We think there is a high probability of increased regulations surrounding carbon emissions that will likely raise Vulcans operations costs. Stricter energy efficiency requirements could also lead to higher energy prices, which already make up a large portion of Vulcans production costs. Nevertheless, given no alternatives to aggregates in the construction process, we see a low materiality impact to Vulcan's valuation, as any increased costs should ultimately be passed on to end-market customers.","We assign Vulcan an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Exemplary rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We view Vulcan's balance sheet as sound. Although the company operates in an industry with medium unleveraged business risk underpinned by the high revenue cyclicality from its construction end markets, it carries low balance sheet risk. Very low leverage and very low near-term debt maturities support its healthy balance sheet. Given a more disciplined approach in the last decade, we do not think acquisitions are a major risk to future balance sheet health. We see Vulcan's investments as exceptional. As the largest player in the U.S. aggregates market, the firm continues to successfully expand its footprint and has grown both organically and inorganically. Vulcan has selected its end markets well, with its largest states having favorable demographics. This includes robust demand for road work, financial capacity to pay for projects, and above-average population growth. In more recent years, the company has completed appropriate acquisitions. The 2017 acquisition of Aggregates USA serves as a good example of a value-accretive deal. The company overpaid for U.S. Concrete in 2021, but the target was less than 5% the size of Vulcan, minimizing potential value destruction. Vulcan has also done an excellent job integrating acquisitions. Thus, our view on Vulcan's investment decisions is unchanged even after that deal. Finally, we think distributions are appropriate. Since 2013, Vulcan has steadily increased its dividend without sacrificing its balance sheet health or its investments while periodically executing share repurchases. We expect continued dividend growth and additional share repurchases during times of strong demand as Vulcan continues to generate strong free cash flows.","Vulcan Materials is the United States' largest producer of construction aggregates (crushed stone, sand, and gravel). Its largest markets include Texas, California, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and Alabama. In 2022, Vulcan sold 263.4 million tons of aggregates, 12.2 million tons of asphalt mix, and 10.5 million cubic yards of ready-mix. As of Dec. 31, 2022, the company had nearly 16 billion tons of aggregates reserves.","We think Vulcan has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt-service requirements and future capital-allocation decisions. The company's leverage increased following its 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete. At the end of 2022, net leverage was roughly 2.5 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA, compared with managements target of roughly 2-2.5 times. Continued improvement in construction markets should help leverage to improve further, and we expect net debt/adjusted EBITDA to stay within managements target. The company has about $4 billion in outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2048, but its next maturity is not until 2025, when roughly $400 million is due. We expect additional bolt-on acquisitions that will likely be focused on companies in the aggregates industry. Vulcan has a history of strong free cash flow generation, even in a downturn, which demonstrates the durability of its business model.",VMC,Basic Materials,28651405312.0,NYQ,601280.0,USD,211.8999938964844,True,0,211.99800038057535,236.35975326726916,1
24/11/2023,Illumina Faces Both Internal and External Challenges,Illumina Inc,ILMN,5,10/11/2023,Julie Utterback,97.76,USD,23/11/2023,228.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,10/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Illumina's third-quarter results exceeded profit expectations, but a challenging macroenvironment in life sciences and instrument transition issues cut into management's 2023 guidance again and led to a much lower initial view for 2024 than we were expecting. With a continued delay of normalized growth patterns for its legacy business and the potential for Illumina to realize a lower Grail valuation than we believe it deserves if forced to divest it in late 2024, we are lowering our fair value estimate on Illumina by 15% to $228 per share from $269 previously. Shares remain steeply discounted to fair value, however. Like other life science firms, Illumina's third-quarter sales growth of 1% in constant currency was related to internal issues that are being exacerbated by external challenges. Specifically, sequencing consumables declined 4%, as customers wound down their consumable inventories on previous instruments before ramping up on new instrument consumables. Positively, Illumina just released the new 25B flow cell, which should improve the economics of using the new NovaSeq X and may boost consumable demand, going forward. Unfortunately, the macro challenges hurting other life science players look likely to infect Illumina's instrument trends, and management lowered its NovaSeq X system placement expectation to 330-340 in 2023, down from about 390 previously (although higher than the 300 expected initially), as instrument sales cycles are elongating. Also, similar to other life science players, China demand was especially weak in the quarter, with sales declining 25% in constant currency. Illumina may face tough comparable periods in China through mid-2024. Considering those trends, management reduced its 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to only $0.60 to $0.70, suggesting that Illumina will generate a loss in the typically strong fourth quarter. Also, management believes Illumina's results in 2024 will look similar to 2023, which disappointed us.","Genomic sequencing remains a relatively early stage market, and expanding sequencing indications, including the nascent liquid biopsy applications, create large growth opportunities for Illumina's operations. Illumina's very large installed base of sequencing instruments should translate into significant ongoing sales of high-margin consumables and maintenance services. The Grail assets hold substantial promise, so even if antitrust regulators force Illumina to unwind the transaction, Illumina investors may get a decent return on that investment eventually.","Disruptive technology risks could threat Illumina's industry-leading sequencing platform, leading to market share losses and profit declines. A significant portion of Illuminas growth will require clinical adoption of sequencing technology, which faces challenges beyond competition related to regulation, validation, treatment guidelines, and reimbursement. Illuminas success depends on managements ability to maintain innovation and astute capital allocation, which is not guaranteed.",10/11/2023,"Illumina aims to transform human health practices through its leadership of genomic sequencing and related applications. The firm provides a broad range of instruments and related consumables to help researchers and clinicians identify and understand genetic variations. The scale of these projects can be wide, such as population genomic initiatives being pursued in many countries, or narrow, such as noninvasive prenatal screening. We believe Illumina will continue to benefit from the rapidly expanding applications of genomic sequencing tools through its own innovation and select acquisitions.  During the past decade or so, technological advancements in the sequencing industry have largely been led by Illumina and brought down the cost of assembling one genome from nearly $3 billion in the 13-year Human Genome Project completed in 2003 to $1,000 after Illumina introduced HiSeq X in early 2014. Further innovation, like the NovaSeq, continued to push down these costs, and Illumina expects its new NovaSeq X Series to enable the $100 genome, which could greatly increase the accessibility of genomic sequencing. At a lower cost, genome sequencing could have wide appeal in clinical applications beyond current strongholds in oncology and reproductive health. Threats from disruptive technologies may never fully disappear, though. For example, new cheaper sequencing tools may eventually displace Illumina's stronghold in genomic sequencing. Currently, we remain unconvinced that emerging systems will fully dethrone Illumina's sequencing technologies, though, given the switching costs associated with its large installed system base and its own new commercialization efforts. Additionally, the firm's recent bet on Grail's liquid biopsy technology exposes it to new risks in the very large but nascent preventative care testing market for cancer. For example, it remains to be seen if practitioners and payers will get onboard with the new technology. Also, future entrants could disrupt this end market, which we think will depend mainly on intangible assets rather than switching costs, in the long run.","We believe Illumina operates with a narrow moat around its genetic analysis tools and services. Since purchasing Solexa with its Genome Reader instrument in 2007, Illuminas continued innovation significantly reduced the cost of sequencing, thereby enabling the rapid expansion of sequencing applications. While disruptive technologies remain a high-risk concern in this innovation-driven industry, we think the firms differentiated technology, ongoing innovation, and large installed system base create significant entry barriers for competitors. Therefore, we expect Illumina to generate economic profits for at least the next decade. Admittedly, the recent acquisition of Grail adds some pressure on Illumina to generate economic profits.Illumina relies on intangible assets, such as the more than 2,000 issued or pending patents in the United States as of early 2023, to keep competition at bay. After application, patents enjoy 20-year terms, which keeps competitors from directly copying the technology. While admittedly, competitors can develop similar technology that reach beyond the legal power of patents, even slightly differentiated technical features can cause an end user to prefer one tool over another similar tool in the companys precise scientific end markets. Additionally, even similar tools have been difficult for other firms to engineer, given the complexity of this field, leaving Illumina the primary player in high-throughput applications and limited competition in lower-throughput fields, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific. While new entrants are emerging, it may be difficult to supplant Illumina based on its differentiated technology and ongoing innovation. In general, the differentiated properties of Illuminas tools affect the cost, accuracy, and speed of the various tests they enable, and those product features create intangible assets that inform decisions to use those tools in specific applications. Thanks to its strong emphasis on internal innovation, including spending nearly 20% of sales on research and development on average during the past five years to advance its sequencing technology and lower the cost per genome, Illumina should remain relevant to end users for the foreseeable future. For example, after the Human Genome Project took 13 years and $2.7 billion to complete in 2003, Illuminas technology helped reduce the cost of whole genome sequencing faster than Moores law in semiconductors--to $1,000 by 2014. This pace of cost reduction and innovation has been unparalleled in the field and has created significant entry barriers for potential rivals, in our opinion. The firm is not resting on its laurels, either; with the new NovaSeq X Series (launching in 2023), Illumina aims to enable a roughly $200 genome including bioinformatics onboard the system, which means the company has roughly reached the $100 genome when considering only the sequencing part of the process.Illumina also benefits from switching costs. For end users wishing to use an Illumina sequencing system, dedicated flow cells, flows, and enzymes from Illumina are required to complete the sequencing process, and most of Illuminas sequencing consumables (nearly 65% of the companys sales) are dedicated. With its large installed base of sequencers, Illumina should be able to count on significant revenue streams from related consumables going forward. The useful life of its instruments likely extends between 5 and 10 years, and as long as Illuminas sequencing tools remain relevant, it should be able to count on substantial consumable revenue for the useful life of its instruments. Also, the relevancy of Illuminas sequencing technology appears likely to continue for a relatively long period. Illumina's genomic sequencing technology enjoys extensive citations in industry publications, and workflows are developing around its systems that need to be repeated consistently. Therefore, we think end users would need a significant reason to jump ship from Illuminas tools from a reproducibility and end user training perspective. These switching costs should be pervasive in life science labs, but they may be even more important in clinical labs because regulators play a role in ensuring test accuracy and workflows while also needing a standardized approach for a typically less skilled workforce.Nonetheless, disruptive technology remains a key ongoing threat. For example, BGI Genomics, which operates primarily in China due to ongoing intellectual property disputes with Illumina (another part of its ESG risks), announced in early 2020 that its custom-built technology can sequencing a genome for $100. In China, this homegrown competitor may be preferred by the government and end users, and if BGI is allowed to operate more widely, Illumina's dominance of the genomic sequencing market may dissipate somewhat. Other new startups like Ultima and Element look set to enter the fray with cheap technology, too. In general, other sequencing techniques could emerge that eclipse Illumina's technology eventually. However, we expect Illumina to remain economically profitable because of its intangible assets and switching costs for at least the next 10 years, which informs our narrow moat rating.","Our High Uncertainty Rating for Illumina reflects our assessment of the firm in the context of Morningstars broader coverage universe of about 1,600 stocks. Illuminas rating is higher than that of most of its life science/diagnostic peers, which are typically rated Medium, reflecting the elevated disruptive technology risk in the company's recently acquired Grail subsidiary and its legacy business. The Grail technology was recently launched, and the potential uptake of its products could range from massive hit to massive flop in the long run. That technology is untested in the marketplace, creating significant upside opportunities in a large potential end market as well as significant downside risks related to potential competition, reimbursement-related risks, and practitioner behaviors. Disruptive technology from a new genome sequencing platform is a significant risk to Illumina's legacy technology, in our view, too. New potential competitors have recently highlighted technology could enable sequencing at $100 per genome, and with those new entrants, Illuminas iron grip on the sequencing field may be loosening a bit, although we suspect inherent switching costs in Illumina's technology and ongoing innovation will help keep the firms narrow moat intact.","Our capital allocation rating for Illumina remains Standard. The firm's balance sheet appears sound with low net debt obligations relative to its enterprise value, and its limited shareholder distributions remain appropriate for its status as a growth stage company in a developing industry. Overall, investments remain the most important component of our capital allocation assessment, and we think Illumina only deserves fair marks in investments because of concerns raised by the Grail transaction. Historically, Illuminas innovation has been supported by high R&D spending combined with acquisitions, and up until the Grail transaction in 2021, those activities led to impressive growth and returns on invested capital. In fact, Illuminas dominance in the sequencing market largely stems from the 2007 acquisition of Solexa, which gave Illumina the foundation of its fluorescently labeled terminator sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry in its sequencing machines. The company still aims to have similar success with the recent Grail acquisition, which opens up the nascent early stage cancer detection market to Illumina. However, Illumina completed this transaction over the protests of antitrust regulators that could require Illumina to unwind the deal in the near future, which may not be enough time to realize the value of that investment in such a nascent asset. Also, this transaction has created significant uncertainty around Illumina's cash flows, as Grail is currently in investment mode, draining Illumina's coffers while Grail's liquid biopsy technology looks unlikely to achieve profitability for many years. Overall, while we think Illumina has excelled at driving industry innovation and picking winners through capital deployment in the past, the Grail acquisition has created a stain on management's record.Activist investor Carl Icahn entered Illumina story in spring 2023 and, so far, has succeeded in getting new management on the board and in the CEO role. The future vision for Illumina under this new management team has yet to be fully articulated. However, Icahn's goals of divesting Grail and focusing on shoring up its legacy sequencing business appear likely, especially if regulatory appeals on recent antitrust rulings on Grail do not go Illumina's way.","Illumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates about 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illuminas high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays (about 10% of sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.","Illumina's financial flexibility declined a bit to purchase Grail, but given the use of equity and limited debt, Illumina's balance sheet remains lightly leveraged, in our opinion. As of September 2023, the company held about $0.9 billion of cash and investments and owed $1.5 billion in debt, which we think the company should be able to easily manage. By maturity, Illumina owes $500 million in 2025, $500 million in 2027, and $500 million in 2031. Additionally, the company may owe the EU EUR 432 million in a fine for front-running the Grail deal, which Illumina is currently appealing. While those obligations are significant relative to current cash flows, they should be easily manageable for a firm that generated roughly $1 billion in free cash flow prior to the acquisition of the loss-generating Grail operations.",ILMN,Healthcare,17434652672.0,NMS,4135290.0,USD,97.76000213623048,True,1,142.32294132007883,132.9379015322025,1
24/11/2023,Thomson Reuters' Businesses Are Resilient and Internal Initiatives Are Driving Margin Growth,Thomson Reuters Corp,TRI,2,01/11/2023,Rajiv Bhatia,189.33,CAD,23/11/2023,156.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,A,01/11/2023,"Narrow moat-rated Thomson Reuters reported a slight revenue miss but strong profits partly due to expense timing. Revenues missed the FactSet consensus estimate by 1% but adjusted EBITDA of $632 million beat the consensus estimate of $585 million. Management maintained its 2023 margin outlook of 39% and attributed the expense beat to timing, but we believe this may prove conservative for the full year. As we tweak our model, we are modestly increasing our fair value estimate on Thomson Reuters' shares to $112 from $109 primarily due to time value of money. While Thomson Reuters' businesses have many positive attributes, we regard shares as a touch pricey at current levels. Overall, we are not concerned with the slight revenue miss as organic growth of 6% was roughly consistent with the 5% seen in the second quarter and 6% seen in the first quarter. Organic growth rates were generally steady across the firm's larger segments amidst macroeconomic uncertainty which underpins our Morningstar Uncertainty rating of low. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 39.6% were up substantially from 34.0%. Management noted the timing of certain expenses such as incentive compensation was favorable in the quarter but is expected to normalize. We note that in the second quarter, margins were also elevated and expected to normalize. Overall, our model assumes 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins of 39.6% which is above the firm's forecast of about 39%.","A renewed focus and new management following the Refinitiv divestment could see margins improve, driving profitability. Increasing regulatory complexity and requirements for a library of previous years of regulations increase barriers to entry, reduce competition, and strengthen advantages in the legal and tax and accounting segments. The firm's legal segment pricing power has been modest despite high market share and thus could potentially be higher.","Since divesting Refinitiv and instituting its expense reduction programs, the firm's valuation has risen, which could limit upside given that the firm's efforts are already appreciated by the market. An accelerated decline in the global print business could cause the firm to miss organic revenue growth and profit targets. Customer attrition associated with a pivot from on-premises software to the public cloud could hurt Reuters' market share and growth in moaty legal and tax and accounting segments.",01/11/2023,"For most of the 2010s, Thomson Reuters was a laggard relative to its information services peers, in our view. Since deciding to spin off its Refinitiv financial and risk operations to London-based LSE Group, we believe the firm has gained more focus. Some of its past offerings have been clunky, and we believe efforts to streamline its businesses should lead to meaningful margin expansion and higher retention in the years ahead. We view Thomson Reuters' legal offerings as the firm's crown jewel. The company's Westlaw offering serves as an important research service for lawyers. Thomson Reuters' main competitor in the space is RELXs LexisNexis, but given the critical nature of the information being sought, many law firms subscribe to both services.  The firm's other two main businesses are its corporate and tax and accounting segments. We believe these three units will constitute the core of Thomson Reuters' operations going forward, as the other two segments are news, which operates with thinner margins, and print, which is highly profitable but in decline.  Thomson Reuters should be able to double down on industry-leading software like Westlaw in the legal segment and Checkpoint in tax and accounting, leveraging a customer base that includes the Big Four global accounting firms and virtually all the top 100 U.S. legal and accounting firms in some capacity. In our view, the stickiness of the firm's products in legal and accounting (which overlap almost completely with corporate) should help Reuters navigate a piecemeal pivot to cloud software, or SaaS offerings, with minimal attrition.","In our view, Thomson Reuters has developed a narrow Morningstar economic moat rating based on switching costs and intangible assets, supported by a suite of software offerings that intersect with critical business functions. Comprehensive, carefully curated databases in the legal and corporate verticals represent strong intangible assets, propping up the popular Westlaw and Checkpoint research offerings, while integration of timely editorial content across the business helps legal and accounting professionals find the information they need quickly and accurately in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. The firms legal segment has developed intangible assets via an impressive legal database replete with decades of records, case law, law reviews, articles, dockets, and rulings--all of which have been carefully curated for decades by a team of more than 100 lawyers. This database provides the basis for the marquee law research offering on the market, Westlaw Edge, and integration with the West Key Number System helps professionals find the research they need, quickly and accurately. Notably, Westlaws legal database integrates seamlessly with innovative artificial intelligence enabled features like litigation analytics, KeyCite Overruling risk, and WestSearch plus. The firm charges a premium price for its product, with some courts going so far as to indicate a preference for Westlaw citations, or those of LexisNexis, its closest competitor.We also see evidence of switching costs in the legal space, primarily driven by integration with mission-critical processes and high-contact workflow solutions. With respect to the former, enterprise legal management software can touch e-billing, matter management, project workflows, working capital management, tax preparation, compliance, collaboration and data storage. Firms often initiate with the purchase of an e-billing or compliance software, expanding into additional offerings (workflow or matter management) as needs dictate or growth renders such a transition economically beneficial. With tens or hundreds of cases in progress simultaneously, different billing arrangements (sometimes bespoke agreements) in place, and management of billable hours or contract-based receipts, switching would understandably be a nightmare. Systems familiarity is a factor as well, especially with offerings like Reuters HighQ, which operates as a high-touch work-flow solution with nearly constant interaction. Finally, with increased pressure on legal firms to deliver more for less and many firms electing to bring less complex legal functions in-house, productivity tools are becoming a requirement for successful practice management. In the tax and accounting segment, switching costs and intangible assets serve as the moat basis. Its leading tax solutions offer a hard value proposition via robotic process automation, which substantially lowers firms overhead costs by automating routine activities and freeing employees to spend more time on value additive projects. Its comprehensive suite of tax preparation products, including a state-of-the-art workflow solution, Onesource, permit Reuters to engage in a classic land-and-expand strategy familiar in software, whereby the firm sells one product (often UltraTax, its basic offering that handles 1040, 1120, 1065, and 1041 filings) and later encourages its clients to purchase adjacent products that seamlessly integrate, like the SaaS Onvio cloud-based product or the rest of the CS Professional tax-preparation suite. A carefully curated database offers valuable IP, with teams of accounting experts integrating timely editorial news and regulatory changes with an AI-enabled search product, Checkpoint Edge, that allows generalist corporate tax officers to effectively handle a complex legal and regulatory environment across jurisdictions. Increasing regulation, and the complexities involved with international taxation, should allow the firm to leverage economies of scale in its development of a tax and accounting database, which becomes incrementally better each time a user engages with its search functionalities. While the firms headline retention ratio in tax and accounting would be on the border of awarding a narrow moat on a stand-alone basis quantitatively (at 90%), the churn inherent in service of smaller- and medium-sized businesses (which represent roughly 80% of Thomson Reuters clientele in the space) indicates that retention is likely higher with the firms largest customers. For reference, Intuit sees a retention ratio of 79% (with a focus on individuals and small and medium enterprises) and Xero, a cloud-only tax software offering, sees retention of 80%. Qualitatively, the marginal benefit afforded by switching tax software providers only very rarely exceeds the costs of employee training, the risks involved in data transfer, and the direct cost of running two programs concurrently during the transition period. Addressing the last of the big three segments, we view corporate as sharing the same underlying moat sources as legal and accounting, largely because it sells essentially the same product suite through a different channel. Corporate, for example, sees sales of Westlaw (legal), Checkpoint (legal and tax), Onesource (tax), and Practical Law (legal), with only a slightly different mix of products and a handful of smaller corporate-specific solutions like Integration Point which manages supply chains, taxation across jurisdictions, and procurement savings for multi-national organizations. Functionally, corporate revenue includes the Big Four accounting firms, as well as general counsels, tax officers, and compliance officers in corporations worldwide. With respect to the remaining segments, we regard Reuters News as a no-moat segment, given that the segment enjoys no competitive advantages in an essentially commoditized news and editorial space, and that it has delivered adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to midsingle digits since the Refinitiv separation. A $325 million contract with Refinitiv to provide content through 2048 is essentially a zero-margin proposition, impeding any ability to earn excess returns in the space. Finally, though global print enjoys significant adjusted EBITDA margins (often over 40%) and leverages moaty legal content, we view the business as in runoff, with the firm projecting a roughly 4% top-line contraction in perpetuity as legal libraries and even governments begin to adopt digital solutions.","Due to the closing of its deal with LSE Group, Thomson Reuters had ownership of about 72.4 million shares of LSE Group, after accounting for shares sold to cover taxes. As of Oct. 1, 2023, Thomson Reuters held about 16.9 million shares of LSE Group and we expect the firm to continue to sell shares over the next few years in accordance with its lockup agreement. As such, the valuation of these shares is a function of LSE Group's share price. Given that most of its revenue is recurring, Thomson Reuters' revenue growth is a function of its revenue retention and its ability to upsell and acquire new customers. We view retention as a function of Thomson Reuters' ability to effectively serve its clients and the general macro environment. The company's fortunes will now be much more tied to making smart acquisitions that can be easily integrated without destroying value. The company could overpay for an acquisition using debt which could increase the company's risk profile. However, the company's leverage ratios remain well below pre-Refinitiv highs. From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we view the largest risks as stemming from business ethics and product governance issues. Thomson Reuters business is data intensive and failure to keep data secure and private could harm its reputation. Thomson Reuters, along with RELX Groups LexisNexis, has leading market share for legal research and a result could face antitrust scrutiny. Due to its global operations, Thomson Reuters is subject to economic, political, and social risks in the countries it operates. Thus far, we believe management has adequately managed ESG risks.Overall, we expect Thomson Reuters to be able to weather a wide variety of economic conditions and assign it a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low. ","In our view, Thomson Reuters merits a Standard capital allocation rating. We view the companys balance sheet as sound, capital investment decisions as fair, and capital return strategy as appropriate.Thomson Reuters targets a 2.5 times leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) and has currently been running below that. We believe the 2.5 times leverage target is reasonable. Thomson Reuters has deleveraged meaningfully. We believe the low leverage gives the firm the opportunity to pursue a large deal if it makes strategic sense. Historically, we believe Thomson Reuters was not managed optimally for shareholders. For example, operating margin and revenue growth lagged peers. Since the divestiture of Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters management appears to be making a lot of highly rational investments focused on creating long-term value for shareholders. We view the divestiture of Refinitiv as a significant positive for the company. If management continues making long-term investments in new products and accretive tuck-in acquisitions at reasonable prices, we would likely consider raising our capital allocation rating. The firm targets a dividend payout ratio of 50%-60% which we believe is appropriate given the recurring revenue model. In 2020, the firm hit the brakes on share repurchases. Though this was in line with peers, we believe repurchases would have created value. In 2020, the company named Steve Hasker as CEO. He arrived at Thomson Reuters after a short spell at private equity firm TPG and previously held the position of chief operating officer at Nielsen. Although it's too early in his tenure to give a complete opinion, we believe his combination of deal-making expertise and experience selling data prepares him to be successful at Thomson Reuters.James Smith was CEO from 2012 to 2020, and we believe his decision to slow acquisition activity was a positive for shareholders. In addition, the two separate Refinitiv divestitures appear to have created significant value for shareholders while significantly deleveraging the balance sheet. From 2009 to 2013, the company spent $950 million a year on acquisitions. In 2008, the company acquired Reuters Group for $17 billion. Subsequently, Thomson Reuters would record $3 billion in goodwill impairment as a result of Reuters. We believe the company is best suited for acquiring companies whose primary asset is a proprietary database or technology that can be easily incorporated into Thomson Reuters existing offerings.","Thomson Reuters is the result of the $17.6 billion megamerger of Canadas Thomson and the United Kingdoms Reuters Group in 2008. In 2021, Thomson Reuters completed the sale of Refinitiv to LSE Group. Thomson Reuters' three largest segments are its legal professionals, Tax and accounting, and corporates segments. Legal professionals is about 42% of the firm's revenue and 47% of the firm's adjusted EBITDA. Tax and accounting makes up about 20%-25% of the firm's revenue and EBITDA. Corporates, which consists of legal professionals and tax and accounting products sold to corporations, also makes up about 20%-25% of the firm's revenue and EBITDA. Thomson Reuters' smaller segments include its Reuters news business and global print business.","At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the company had a net debt/EBITDA ratio (the value of debt obligations outstanding less cash and equivalents divided by adjusted EBITDA) of 0.8x times, a substantial improvement from 2016, when debt stood at about 2.5 times EBITDA. Total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion at the end of September 2023, with the firm holding $2.5 billion in cash.As the firm's lock-up provisions expire, Thomson Reuters will reduce its stake in LSE Group and use the proceeds for activities that better align with its long-term strategy. As of Oct. 1, 2023, Thomson Reuters held 16.9 million shares of LSE Group. We expect Thomson Reuters to continue to divest through 2025. The stock sales will give the firm significant amounts of capital to repay debt, pursue acquisitions, and repurchase shares.",TRI.TO,Industrials,86670827520.0,TOR,293563.0,CAD,189.58999633789065,True,0,174.38011877876903,201.34780418582193,1
25/11/2023,J&J's Diverse Portfolio of Innovative Healthcare Products Sets Up Steady Long-Term Growth,Johnson & Johnson,JNJ,4,17/10/2023,Damien Conover,150.82,USD,23/11/2023,164.0,Low,Wide,Standard,A,17/10/2023,"Johnson & Johnson reported solid third-quarter results slightly above our projections, but we are not changing our fair value estimate based on the minor outperformance. While we recognize that growth in the pharmaceutical division is likely slowing due to upcoming patent pressures, we continue to view J&J as slightly undervalued, with the market likely underappreciating the firms solid pipeline, a key factor also supporting the our wide moat rating. The drug unit posted 4% operational growth, a rate that should largely continue until patent pressures increase in mid-2024. In the firms largest two drug segments, immunology and oncology, new product launches and solid entrenched drugs supported steady gains. However, we expect immunology sales growth to flatten in 2024 with the likely biosimilar launches on Stelara (which represents close to 13% of total sales) in mid-2024 in Europe and early 2025 in the United States. In oncology, J&J looks well positioned for growth with limited patent pressures and robust pipeline advancements. We remain most bullish on lung cancer treatment Rybrevant plus lazertinib, which recently showed superior data versus market leader Tagrisso (over $5 billion in 2022 sales) from AstraZeneca. The device segment posted 6% operational growth, a rate that we expect will decelerate as the overall market slows. While we believe pent-up demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is likely still fueling device growth, we expect growth to slow as the market normalizes. With regard to talc litigation, with J&J having won close to 75% of the over 40 talc cases that have rulings and close to two thirds of claimants favoring the $8.9 billion settlement, we believe the $8.9 billion established for the litigation will be sufficient to address the claims. On capital allocation, we increasingly expect J&J to make a major acquisition over the next two years, given its very strong balance sheet and the likely slowing growth the firm faces in 2025.","The majority of J&J's near-term patent losses are for products that are hard to manufacture, which should reduce the intensity of generic competition. Diverse healthcare segments help insulate J&J from downturns in the overall economy, offering a defensive growth opportunity with a steady and likely growing dividend. Several of J&J's key next generation pipeline drugs are specialty drugs that tend to carry strong pricing power as well as lower regulatory hurdles for approval.","J&J's late-stage drug pipeline is relatively weak for the size of the company, which could create long-term headwinds for growth. Patent pressures in the drug group are increasing over the next several years, which will likely slow the growth of the firm's largest division. Several of J&J's key drugs are facing increasing competition, which could slow the growth rate of the drug group.",05/06/2023,"Johnson & Johnson stands alone as a leader across the major healthcare industries. The company maintains a diverse revenue base, a developing research pipeline, and exceptional cash flow generation that together create a wide economic moat. J&J holds a leadership role in diverse healthcare segments, including medical devices, consumer healthcare products, and several pharmaceutical markets. Contributing close to 50% of total revenue, the pharmaceutical division boasts several industry-leading drugs, including immunology drugs Stelara and Tremfya as well as cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica. The medical device group brings in almost one third of sales, with the company holding controlling positions in many areas, including orthopedics and Ethicon Endo-Surgery's surgical devices. The consumer division largely rounds out the remaining business lines, but the firm is planning to divest its consumer healthcare group called Kenvue. A partial divestment of close to 10% of Kenvue occured in May 2023 with the remaining divestment planned for later in 2023, which will leave the remaining company more focused on drugs and devices. Research and development efforts are resulting in next-generation products. The pharmaceutical segment has recently launched several new blockbusters. However, relative to the company's size, J&J needs to increase the number of meaningful drugs in late-stage development to support long-term growth. The company has also created new medical devices, including innovative contact lenses, minimally invasive surgical tools and robotic instruments.  These multiple businesses generate substantial cash flow. J&J's healthy free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is over 20% of sales. Strong cash generation has enabled the firm to increase its dividend for over the past half century, and we expect this to continue. It also allows J&J to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that will augment growth. Diverse operating segments coupled with expected new products insulate the company more from patent losses relative to other Big Pharma firms. ","We believe Johnson & Johnson carries one of the widest moats in the healthcare sector, supported by intellectual property in the drug group, switching costs in the device segment, and strong brand power from the consumer group. The company's diverse revenue base, strong pipeline, and robust cash flow generation create a very wide economic moat. An extensive salesforce makes J&J a powerful candidate for a smaller biotechnology company looking to partner on a new drug, which strengthens Johnson & Johnson's ability to bring new products to market.Johnson & Johnson's diverse operations are a major pillar supporting the wide moat. The company holds a leadership role in a number of segments, including medical devices, OTC medicines, and several drug markets. Further, the company is not overly dependent on one particular operating segment; the pharmaceutical business, medical device group, and consumer products represent close to 50%, 30%, and 20% of total sales, respectively. Additionally, within each segment no one product dominates sales. Despite carrying some lower-margin divisions, J&J maintains strong pricing power and has posted gross margins above 70% during the past four years, validating its strong competitive position. Johnson & Johnson's R&D efforts support its robust revenue base. In pharmaceuticals, the firm recently launched several new blockbusters, which should allow Johnson & Johnson to escape largely unscathed from upcoming patent expirations. Its efforts in medical devices, including robotics and digital data, should help maintain leadership in several medical device areas as well as support strong pricing power. Further, switching costs remain high with several of the device products. (For example, physicians switching vendors for hip and knee devices could take weeks if not months to learn the new products, which keeps physicians tied to the company's products.) On the consumer side, new product advancements combined with a solid brand power (reinforced by marketing campaigns) should maintain solid pricing power.We think the firm does face environmental, social, and governance risks, particularly related to potential U.S. drug price-related policy reform (close to 30% of total sales are generated by prescription drugs sales in the U.S.) to increase access by lowering drug prices. Ongoing product governance issues, including litigation related to side effects and patents, also weigh on the company. While we have factored these threats into our analysis, we don't see them as material to the company's moat rating.","Johnson & Johnson needs to overcome several legal roadblocks, including remaining litigation surrounding central nervous system drug Risperdal, talcum powder, surgical mesh products, and opioid drugs. While we believe several of these legal cases are toward the end of the process, additional hurdles can still arise. The litigation can cause major settlements and could damage its sterling reputation. Over the longer term, the company faces typical healthcare risks such as reduced pricing power from both governments and pharmacy benefit managers, regulatory delays, and nonapprovals as well as increasingly aggressive generic competition for small-molecule drugs and biologics. However, with such a wide portfolio of products, we assign the firm a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.Our Uncertainty Rating for the company is not materially affected by ESG risks. We see access to basic services (tied to drug pricing) as the biggest ESG risk that the firm needs to manage. J&J generates close to one third of total sales from U.S. prescription drug sales (slightly lower relative to peers), so additional major pricing reforms could weigh on the company's sales and margins.Additionally, we assume a more than 50% probability of J&J seeing future costs related to product governance ESG risks (such as off-label marketing or litigation related to side effects) and model base-case annual legal costs at 3% of non-GAAP net income (on the high end relative to peers based on J&Js product portfolio being more prone to possible litigation).","Overall, we rate Johnson and Johnsons capital allocation as Standard. The rating reflects our belief that J&J possesses a sound balance sheet, a reasonable track record of investments, and largely fair shareholder distributions.We believe J&J holds a sound balance sheet with low levels of risk regarding: 1) the size of the debt carried; 2) the business cyclicality facing the firm; and 3) the debt maturity outlook. While an argument could be made to increase the leverage of the balance sheet to be more active in investing, we believe the company along with the majority of firms in the large cap biopharma industry should hold ample balance sheet strength to support opportunistic acquisitions as dynamic scientific data emerges that might require relatively investment quick action. Also, a strong balance sheet helps biopharma firms through most product litigation challenges with minimal concern by the market. Turning to investments, we believe J&J is operating at a reasonable level. The company tends to spend over 20% of sales on R&D for the drug business (above the industry average of high teens) and close to 9% of sales on R&D for the device business (close to the industry average of 8-9%). The company has shown high productivity with strong execution in drug pipeline development. The strong productivity in creating the next generation of drugs has yielded enough new drugs to help mitigate patent losses. The strong productivity in innovative new drugs (largely targeting areas of unmet medical need, especially in oncology and immunology) also helps fortify the firms wide moat and expand the returns on invested capital. However, on the negative side, the innovation in the device segment appears to have largely lagged peers in the orthopedic space, especially around robotic developments.On the acquisition side, J&J has executed reasonably well. The largest recent acquisition of Actellion for close to $30 billion brought in an important rare disease franchise where pricing power looks strong. However, we are skeptical the acquisition will create much value due to the high price point paid for the firm. Additionally, the $6 billion acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals also looked fairly expensive, but positive on the pipeline development side. Regarding distributions, we view J&Js dividends and share repurchases as about right. J&J has a very long history of consistently raising its dividend, giving investors high confidence in the business. Further, the firm is able to fund strong internal investments while supporting the dividend and some moderate and largely well-timed share repurchases over the past several years. Turning to top management, Joaquin Duato took over the CEO spot from Alex Gorsky in early 2022. While the announced transition came a little earlier than we had expected with Gorsky only 61 years old, family health issues appear to have played a potential role in the decision. Given Duatos 30 plus years at J&J, including the recently successful strategy work in the drug and consumer divisions, we believe Duato will offer a continuity of the industry leading innovative strategy pursued under Gorsky. Further, we expect continued steady growth based on diverse group of product lines. However, we dont expect the extra-long duration typical of a J&J CEO as Duato was 59 years old when he took on the top spot. With strong leaders supporting Duato, including Jennifer Taubert (head of the drug unit) and Ashley McEvoy (head of the device unit) at the two largest business segments and Joe Wolk as CFO, Duato has both a strong support structure for the current business operations and leading internal candidates for the eventual next CEO succession.","Johnson & Johnson is the world's largest and most diverse healthcare firm. Three divisions make up the firm: pharmaceutical, medical devices and diagnostics, and consumer. The drug and device groups represent close to 80% of sales and drive the majority of cash flows for the firm. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neurology, pulmonary, cardiology, and metabolic diseases. The device segment focuses on orthopedics, surgery tools, vision care, and a few smaller areas. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and womens health. The consumer group is being divested in 2023 under the new name Kenvue. Geographically, just over half of total revenue is generated in the United States.","Johnson & Johnson holds one of the strongest financial positions in the healthcare sector with projected debt/EBITDA of close to 1 time for 2024. The acquisitions of Actelion and Momenta did put a dent in the company's cash balance, but with annual free cash flow of close to $25 billion, J&J is in sound financial shape. Even with expected further bolt-on acquisitions, dividend payouts and share repurchases, the company should remain on solid financial footing. From an operating standpoint, patent losses are mitigated by several diverse operating lines in medical devices and consumer products so cash flows should remain relatively stable. Additionally, we expect share repurchases over the next several years will drawdown the share count.",JNJ,Healthcare,381265051648.0,NYQ,10289928.0,USD,150.82000732421875,True,1,159.66270590388822,158.15716062946666,1
24/11/2023,We Expect a Constructive Rate Case Outcome in Alliant's Wisconsin Territory ,Alliant Energy Corp,LNT,4,03/11/2023,Andrew Bischof,49.54,USD,23/11/2023,58.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,B,03/11/2023,"We are maintaining our Alliant Energy $58 per share fair value estimate after the company reported third-quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, compared with $0.93 in the same year-ago period. Management narrowed 2023 EPS guidance to $2.85 to $2.93, from $2.82 to $2.96. Our $2.90 per share estimate remains unchanged. The company initiated 2024 EPS guidance of $2.99 to $3.13, an implied 6% increase and consistent with the company's long-term 5% to 7% earnings growth target. We think the company can achieve the high end of that growth range.Alliant trades at a 13% discount to our fair value estimate as of Nov. 2, offering investors an opportunity to buy at an attractive price a high-quality utility operating in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with good management execution. Alliant expects to pay a dividend of $1.92 per share in 2024, a 6% increase from $1.81 in 2023. We expect dividend growth in line with our earnings growth forecast. Alliant's 2024-27 capital investment plan supports our earnings growth forecast. Management increased its capital investment plan to $9.1 billion, up from its previous four-year plan totaling $8.5 billion. The increase is attributable to wind repowering opportunities, grid modernization, and additional transmission opportunities at minority-owned ATC. We continue to view Alliant's main two regulatory environments, Iowa and Wisconsin, constructively. Alliant received advanced ratemaking on 400 megawatts of solar at an above-average 10.25% allowed return on equity. In Wisconsin, we expect Alliant to secure a constructive outcome in its pending rate case similar to the terms that peer Wisconsin utility WEC Energy receive in its recent rate decision. President and COO Lisa Barton will become CEO effective Jan. 1. We think Barton is an excellent choice, given her extensive experience in executive positions at American Electric Power before joining Alliant in early 2023.","Alliant's earnings growth prospects are robust, supported by renewable energy projects that have regulatory support. Regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin are embracing renewable energy, providing additional growth opportunities with favorable rate-making. The company operates in constructive jurisdictions, supporting returns and capital projects.","Alliant's aggressive investment plan increases regulatory risk. Should economic recovery slow in Alliant's major markets, Iowa and Wisconsin, customer and load growth could slow. As with all regulated utilities, rising interest rates will raise financing costs and could make the dividend less attractive for income investors.",09/08/2023,"Our forecast for Alliant Energy to invest over $10 billion from 2023-27 supports our estimate for the company to achieve the top half of management's 5%-7% growth target. Management estimates continued capital investment opportunities in the second half of the decade, supporting growth beyond our forecast. Interstate Power and Light, or IP&L, continues to build out renewable energy in Iowa. In addition to its significant wind generation in Iowa, for which the company earns a premium return on equity, the subsidiary now aims to install significant solar generation as well as distributed energy resources. We continue to believe Iowa offers ample renewable energy investment opportunitiesboth wind and solarto support the utility's Clean Energy Blueprint, which plans to eliminate all coal generation by 2040 and achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. At Wisconsin Power and Light, renewable energy is also a focus as the company begins replacing retiring coal generation. WPL plans sizable solar energy investments paired with battery storage. WPL has similar clean energy goals IP&L, including a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, eliminating coal from its generation fleet by 2040, and reaching net-zero carbon emissions from its generation fleet by 2050. Alliant benefits from operating in what we consider two of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions. To maintain earned returns near allowed returns during this period of high investment, management has worked to reduced regulatory lag, received above-average allowed returns across its subsidiaries, and aims continue to reduce operating costs for the near term. At WPL, Alliant Energy filed a rate case that asks regulators to maintain its 10% allowed ROE with modest revenue increases in 2024-25. A decision is expected later this year. We expect an outcome consistent with WEC Energy Group's 9.8% allowed return in its rate outcome last year, which we viewed as constructive. American Transmission Co., which we consider a wide-moat business, is tucked away from consolidated results (16% equity interest). Transmission offers higher returns relative to other rate-regulated investments.","Service territory monopolies and efficient-scale advantages are the primary sources of economic moat for regulated utilities such as Alliant. State and federal regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks. In exchange for regulated utilities service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers. We believe Alliant has healthy relationships with the regulators in its two main states, Iowa and Wisconsin, as exemplified by mechanisms that allow the firm to more closely earn its allowed return on equity.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow Alliant to earn greater than its cost of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing. Intuitively, utilities should have an economic moat based on efficient scale, but in some cases regulation offsets this advantage, preventing excess returns on capital. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions prevents regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moat ratings to many regulated utilities.","We rate Alliant Energy with a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.Alliant Energy's ability to secure rate adjustments depends on maintaining constructive relations with regulators. If regulatory relations sour, regulators could cut the utility's allowed return, resulting in earnings and cash flow pressure. We expect continued constructive regulation across Alliant's service territories, including Alliant's rate case in Wisconsin.Customer resistance to higher rates creates uncertainty surrounding Alliant's growth. Like all regulated utilities, the company must obtain regulators' approval to charge higher rates to fund investments. If regulators don't incorporate adequate profits in allowed rates, the company might cut investment. The company has a significant ongoing development program that is subject to potential cost overruns and political and regulatory risk. Alliant Energy operates natural gas distribution utilities. While we think natural gas will remain the primary source for heating in the Midwest for the foreseeable future, there is risk that policymakers will expedite the shift away from natural gas. Alliant faces environmental, social, and governance risk, particularly given its relatively large coal fleet. Regulators and politicians across its service territories are embracing tighter policies on carbon emissions and greater restrictions on coal generation. Alliant is addressing this risk through its base capital investment program, planned coal retirements, and the addition of renewable energy. Alliant's aspiration of being a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050, with an interim 50% reduction target by 2030, is in line with its utility peers. The company aims to eliminate coal from its generation fleet by 2040. Regulators across its jurisdictions are supporting this transition.Alliant Energy faces the risk of an inflationary environment that raises borrowing costs and makes other investments more attractive for income-seeking investors.","We assign Alliant Energy a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessment of Alliant's balance sheet strength, management's investment decisions, and plans to return capital to shareholders. Alliant Energy has consistently paid out 60%-70% of earnings as dividends, an amount we view as appropriate, given the high quality and relatively stable nature of Alliant's regulated assets. We expect the balance sheet to remain strong, in line with its regulatory requirements and supported by the company's low revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. We expect the company's investment strategy to focus on growing assets through regulated investments, which we think is a reasonable approach.We think shareholders have benefited from management's focus on regulated operations. The company's utilities have earned at or near their allowed returns, a remarkable achievement with aggressive capital spending plans.Service territories in areas with good renewable energy resources have created investment opportunities that management has pursued with success. Management has worked well with state regulators, ensuring excellent regulatory treatment for wind investments, particularly in Iowa.CEO John Larsen, an Alliant Energy veteran who has held numerous positions in engineering and generation, has been CEO since 2019. He previously was president of Alliant Energy and previously president of Wisconsin Power and Light. The company hired Lisa Barton as executive vice president and chief operating officer, likely positioning her to succeed Larsen when he retires. Barton has extensive executive utility experience and we think she would be a strong replacement for Larsen.","Alliant Energy is the parent of two regulated utilities, Interstate Power and Light and Wisconsin Power and Light, serving nearly 985,000 electric customers and 425,000 natural gas-only customers. Both subsidiaries engage in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas. Alliant also owns a 16% interest in American Transmission Co.","With our estimate for $10.5 billion of capital spending planned through 2027, we expect Alliant will be a frequent debt issuer. We also expect the company to issue $1.25 billion in equity to maintain its allowed capital ratios for regulatory purposes. The company has manageable long-term debt maturities, and we anticipate it will be able to refinance its debt as it comes due. We expect total debt/EBITDA to remain around 5.0 times.Even with its large capital expenditure program, Alliant maintains a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We expect total debt/capital to remain around 55% through our forecast. Interest coverage should remain around 5 times throughout our forecast period. Alliant has ample liquidity with cash on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facilities. We believe Alliant's dividend is well covered with its regulated utilities' earnings and expect the dividend payout ratio to remain between 60% and 70%. We expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings.",LNT,Utilities,13139167232.0,NMS,2267916.0,USD,49.540000915527344,True,1,50.22447056489999,49.66802460470247,0
24/11/2023,Hologic's Narrow Economic Moat Remains Strong Thanks to Pandemic,Hologic Inc,HOLX,3,10/11/2023,Debbie Wang,72.18,USD,23/11/2023,70.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,10/11/2023,"Hologic posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that slightly exceeded our estimates on the top line, but this was offset by slightly lower earnings. We are leaving our $70 fair value estimate unchanged. The firm continues to manage the reverberations of demand for pandemic tests softening throughout the year, and were pleased to see quarterly non-COVID-19 revenue rise 17% in constant currency, which reflects solid demand for Hologics nonpandemic products, especially in breast health. Despite the declines in COVID-19 revenue, we think the pandemic-fueled expansion of the Panther installed base has reinforced Hologics narrow economic moat. By expanding the base and number of clients touched by the associated switching costs, Hologic has an opportunity to drive more assays through more Panther platforms. This might be easier said than done, though. As weve discussed previously, Hologic needs to raise utilization of the new Panthers by enlarging the test menu. While the firm had made several acquisitions to expand its array of tests, ramping up adoption remains a relatively gradual process that depends on changes in screening guidelines, physician practices, and reimbursement. This leaves Hologic with a clear runway to growth, but we think its unlikely that there will be a quantum leap in penetration of its new tests. Thus, we assume revenue growth should settle into the midsingle digits and operating margin should reach 20% by fiscal 2025.","Hologic was first to market with an FDA-approved 3D mammography platform in the U.S., giving it a considerable head start in its installed base against GE and Siemens. Hologic controls the lions share of the U.S. liquid-based Pap market, and the Gen-Probe acquisition catapulted the firm into number-one positions in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Over time, reimbursement for 3D mammography has become widespread in the U.S., and there is still room for this to grow outside the U.S.","Shifts in screening guidelines and disruptive technologies can have a significant effect on Hologic's business as we saw with the advent of HPV diagnostics on traditional Pap tests. Hologic's product portfolio varies widely, and we see little opportunity for efficient use of the salesforce to call on different specialists. Despite Hologics full pipeline and best efforts, there is still a degree of clinical and regulatory risk around its products. The regulatory path to approval can be an expensive, time-consuming, and fruitless process.",05/09/2023,"Under CEO Stephen MacMillan's watch, Hologic has been able to focus on structural competitive advantages, improve its balance sheet, and judiciously step into complementary markets, which has smoothed out the vagaries of product cycles.  Though the purchase of Gen-Probe was pricey, Hologic now holds a strong position in a host of molecular diagnostic tests across womens health, infectious disease, and oncology that run solely on its proprietary instrumentation. The technology platform came in handy during the pandemic, and Hologic has skillfully leveraged the opportunity to significantly increase Panther installations, which should pay off over the longer term. Further, Hologic controls roughly 65% of the U.S. digital mammography market and leads the way in 3D mammography. While 3D adoption has slowed, Hologic's clinical data still gives it an edge over its larger competitors, and there are still opportunities to sell ancillary accessories for mammograms and biopsies.  However, Hologic faces secular and competitive hurdles. Recommended cervical screening intervals have lengthened, reducing Pap smear volume and forcing Hologic to preserve market share against Becton Dickinson. In addition, heavyweights General Electric and Siemens compete in the 3D mammography market, which could be challenging, given GE's entrenchment in select hospitals and ability to bundle an extensive menu of capital equipment. While material, we think Hologic has done a good job of navigating the competitive pressures. Importantly, the pandemic opened an opportunity for the company to aggressively pursue enlarging its footprint in the molecular diagnostic market. Overwhelming demand for COVID-19 PCR tests allowed Hologic to expand its installed base by roughly 50%. The related boost in cash flow from these tests also opened the door for Hologic to make strategic purchases of a wider array of molecular diagnostic tests, which could pave the way for a more robust stream of recurring revenue after the pandemic that goes beyond Hologic's historical stronghold in testing for sexually transmitted diseases.","We believe Hologic has dug a narrow economic moat based on the switching costs and intellectual property that surround its breast health and diagnostics platforms. Hologic pioneered the first Food and Drug Administration-approved 3D mammography platform in the U.S. Mammography equipment such as this is typically a big-ticket purchase for hospitals and radiology clinics at price tags of $300,000 per digital unit and up to $450,000 per 3D installation, and the time to retrain on systems and reorganize workflow means that customers have little incentive to switch platforms. Furthermore, it will be considerably less expensive for Hologics 2D customers to upgrade their equipment rather than switch to a competing system. With a sizable installed base, the firm also reaps the benefits of five-year service contracts that annually cost about 10%-12% of the purchase price. While optional, more than 90% of its installed base falls under contract.Additionally, lengthy FDA approval processes and the sophistication of the technology are tall barriers that deter new market entrants, though both General Electric and Siemens have received FDA approval for 3D systems. While this adds a new level of competition and could apply some pricing pressure, we think the growing body of clinical data for Hologic's Genius system helps to establish its superiority in the minds of clinicians. After acquiring Gen-Probe in 2012 and Cytyc before that, Hologics diagnostics division also leverages the high switching costs that surround its proprietary instrumentation and the tests that run on it. Adding to ThinPreps leading share in the liquid-based Pap market, Gen-Probe dramatically expanded Hologics diagnostic capabilities in HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, and blood screening. Once labs commit to the firms automated equipment to streamline operations, they run the companys tests to consolidate workflow to fewer platforms. In addition to the time required to train lab technicians and adjust work flow, steep switching costs are built around instrumentation, with the $150,000 price tag built into per-reagent costs. This molecular diagnostics platform saw a boom during the COVID-19 crisis, and Hologic benefited from demand that significantly enlarged the firm's installed base of machines.Hologic's 2017 acquisition of Cynosure provided a sizable footprint in the aesthetics market. However, we did not think this medical aesthetics business was worthy of a moat on its own, nor did we think the business bolstered Hologic's moat, because the cosmetic laser market is vulnerable to disruptive technology and has low barriers to entry, relatively low switching costs, and little clinical data to differentiate competitive products. Manufacturers compete primarily on the basis of marketing, which isn't necessarily Hologic's forte, in our view. We've mainly been relieved that Hologic decided to jettison the business three years ago, in favor of focusing on its existing footprints in molecular diagnostics and breast health.We think Hologics remaining segments, surgical and skeletal health, do not have moats. The firms hysteroscopic surgical product, MyoSure, has led to pockets of success with strong cash flows. However, lower-cost alternatives have put pressure on its NovaSure product and adverse macroeconomic conditions have resulted in mixed skeletal results. Nevertheless, we believe Hologics breast health and diagnostics segments largely outweigh these drawbacks.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we think there's little risk of these factors causing permanent impairment of Hologic's competitive advantages. However, some of the more vulnerable areas of risk would include the high quality standards that diagnostics makers must follow to ensure results are accurate and valid. As we saw with the Theranos debacle, inaccurate test results can lead to inappropriate medical treatment. This risk is mitigated for Hologic, however as its tests and equipment are regulated by the FDA. We believe Hologic's exposure to product governance risks has actually diminished now that it has divested its medical aesthetics business. The legacy Cynosure business fell into a gray area; though cosmetic lasers are regulated by the FDA, the use of such lasers is left up to the practitioners. In practice, this means practitioners would often use use those lasers off-label, for conditions or procedures for which they were never approved. This exposure for laser manufacturers is exacerbated by the patchwork of regulation regarding who is qualified to use these lasers, which varies by state. At present, just New Jersey requires that only trained medical doctors can use the lasers. In other states, nonphysicians can also operate these lasers, which becomes risky as the medical spas where many of these treatments take place are only loosely regulated on a state-by-state basis.By divesting its aesthetic laser business, Hologic has taken a big step away from product governance risk, in our view.","We believe Hologic's sales mix of capital equipment, consumables, and service revenue translates to average cash flow volatility and warrants a medium uncertainty rating. Hologic's sales are influenced by capital spending patterns in hospitals and clinics, which could be adversely affected by prolonged economic downturns. We think the biggest near-term risk could be significant pressure on hospital capital spending budgets as providers seek to reestablish financial strength following the pandemic. Over the longer term, Hologic's diagnostics and breast health segments are heavily influenced by both revised or newly established screening guidelines, as well as development of disruptive technology. Thus, the firms sales could suffer if screening guidelines lengthen or become more lenient. On the technology front, we think both gene sequencing and liquid biopsy could upset Hologic's existing molecular diagnostics and mammography business.Furthermore, Hologic has significant exposure to regulatory risk, particularly in securing reimbursement and FDA approvals for new product introductions. Also, with approximately 30% of sales coming from international markets, currency headwinds could have a negative impact on Hologic's top and bottom lines and potentially undermine domestic progress.","We award Hologic Standard marks for capital allocation on the basis of sound balance sheet management, fair investment, and appropriate distributions.Under CEO Stephen MacMillan, Hologic has made steady progress in bringing leverage down while also continuing its pattern of picking up tuck-in acquisitions. MacMillan was CEO of Stryker between 2005 and 2012 and has more than 25 years of operational experience in the healthcare industry. Overall, we think MacMillan is well suited for the job following his effective tenure at Stryker, where he executed a number of successful directives while making sound acquisitions. We've seen this experience pay off for Hologic, as the firm has pursued strategic additions opportunistically and ratcheted up operational skill to better integrate these new assets. We like the ancillary products that MacMillan has purchased to complement Hologic's product portfolio, including Supersonic Imagine, Faxitron, Biotheranostics, and Mobidiag. While these acquisitions are less flashy than previous ones, including Cynosure, Gen-Probe, and Cytyc, we think they make strategic sense and, importantly, the firm has been less likely to overpay for them.Our primary complaint is that some of Hologics earlier high-profile acquisitions have come at hefty prices, followed by substantial goodwill write-offs. Hologic has racked up a significant record of substantial write-offs over the last 12 years. Based on disclosed goodwill impairments over the last five years, Hologic has written off nearly $1.5 billion in impairments associated with the Cynosure acquisition. We note that Hologic paid $1.66 billion for Cynosure in fiscal 2017. In 2013, a revaluation of its goodwill led to a $1.1 billion impairment charge in 2013 relating to Third Wave and Gen-Probe. Even earlier in 2009, there was a $2.3 billion related to the Cytyc acquisition. While the entire string of impairments is not a reflection on the current management team, we recognize that the cumulative impact of these independent M&A decisions by different management teams has cost shareholders.","Hologic manufactures proprietary products for the healthcare needs of women. The company operates in five segments: diagnostics (60% of total sales, boosted by pandemic), breast health (14% of sales, suppressed by pandemic), surgical (11%), and skeletal health (1%). While the company traditionally focused on breast health, the acquisition of Gen-Probe put greater emphasis on commercial diagnostics. The United States accounts for the largest portion of the firm's revenue (69%), followed by Europe (20%), Asia (8%), and other international markets (3%). Hologic is headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts.","Hologic took on considerable leverage after its $3.8 billion acquisition of Gen-Probe in 2012, but has deleveraged in the ensuing years and avoided piling on more debt for the purchase of Cynosure. As of June 2023, Hologic owed $2.8 billion in long-term debt and held nearly $2.8 billion in cash representing net debt/adjusted EBITDA at less than 1 timethe lowest we've seen in the last decade. We think this historically low level of leverage reflects the sizable windfall that came from COVID-19. However, even before the emergence of the pandemic in 2020, Hologic had already made significant progress in deleveraging, which we think is a reflection of CEO Stephen MacMillan's preference for operating with substantially less leverage than Hologic's balance sheet held at the beginning of his tenure (when net debt/EBITDA was at 5.0). Under MacMillan's watch when he was CEO of Stryker, that firm's balance sheet typically held more cash than debt. Similarly, MacMillan has consistently brought leverage down at Hologic. These two factors put Hologic in a strong position to pick up tuck-in acquisitions as the opportunities arise, and we expect to see more opportunistic purchases to complement the firm's strength in breast health and molecular diagnostics.",HOLX,Healthcare,17076214784.0,NMS,1344935.0,USD,72.18000030517578,True,0,71.9390589096953,73.07950667393457,0
25/11/2023,"Adoption of Toric, Multifocal, and Silicon Hydrogel Lenses Boosts Cooper's Top and Bottom Lines",The Cooper Companies Inc,COO,3,31/08/2023,Keonhee Kim,339.34,USD,24/11/2023,345.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,31/08/2023,"Narrow-moat Cooper Companies reported third-quarter results that came in higher than our expectations. Total sales were up 10.3% year over year as broad-based adoption of Coopers contact lenses and surgical business fueled growth. Demand for both businesses remains healthy, and management raised its full-year guidance for both segments. After accounting for our elevated near-term assumptions as well as the time value of money impact, we raise our fair value estimate to $345 per share from $325. CooperVision reported a year-over-year sales jump of 11.3% thanks to strong performance from toric and multifocal lenses, both up high-teens during the quarter. This is especially impressive given price only made up roughly 2% of growth, which puts growth from volume and mix at 10% with a 100-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange. Daily silicone hydrogel (SiHy) lenses posted another solid result, up 23%, and these lenses not only help boost sales but also flow nicely down to the line thanks to their higher margins. We view SiHy lenses as a major growth driver for the contact lens industry over the next five years, and while other players in the space have their own offerings Cooper boasts the widest stock keeping unit range. We see trade-ups from non-SiHy to SiHy lenses as a major challenge for manufacturers given a material jump in price, but Cooper offers a variety of SiHy lenses at different price points that we believe could allow consumers to adopt Coopers SiHy lenses more easily. And we see this in actionthe overall contact lens market grew roughly 8% during the quarter, but Cooper took share at 11%.  CooperSurgical continues to boast solid growth, up 8.3% during the quarter. Cooper is among the leaders in the fertility market, and we believe the company offers some of the widest ranges of services in the space. We think Cooper is well positioned to enjoy macro trends, including women delaying childbirth and increasing patient awareness.","Cooper is one of the leading vision care companies in the world with a proven track record of successful product development and it will continue to launch technically superior products over the long term. With an increasing prevalence of myopia, especially in children, Coopers MiSight and its joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will place Cooper as the leading player in myopia management.  Favorable global trends such as an aging population, women having children at a later age, as well as an increasing awareness of womens health will expand CooperSurgicals end markets. ","While the contact lens market share has been stable, lagging research and innovation from Cooper could start to chip away at the companys presence in the space.  Macroeconomic challenges including supply chain issues and inflationary pressures could hinder Coopers contact lens wearers from upgrading their lenses and put pressure on Co Paragard has enjoyed being the only nonhormonal IUD in the U.S. market since launch, but any new nonhormonal IUDs, notably VeraCept, that emerge in the space could steal shares from Paragard. ",31/08/2023,"The Cooper Companies is one of the largest eye care companies in the U.S. It operates in two segments: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision is a pure-play contact lens business and it made up 68% of 2022 total sales. The U.S. contact lens market is mainly controlled by four playersJohnson & Johnson (38% market share), Alcon and Cooper (25% each), and Bausch + Lomb (10%). Market share tends to shift slowly given the high-switching-cost nature of the industry, but each player continues to innovate and launch new products to attract more customers. We expect the segment to grow mid-single digits over our forecast period, driven by an aging population and a growing access to vision care in underpenetrated markets like Asia. We also forecast margin expansion due to more people upgrading their reusable and monofocal contact lenses to daily and specialty lenses, which are priced higher and have higher margins. Cooper will also enjoy tailwinds from an increasing prevalence of myopia, or nearsightedness, because it has MiSight, the first and only FDA-approved (as of 2022) contact lenses for myopia management.  CooperSurgical made up 32% of sales in 2022 and is made up of two business units: fertility and office/surgical. We continue to see women having their first child at a later age and, because fertility is known to decline with age, we expect this to fuel segment growth, especially because Cooper has the broadest product coverage of the IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycle in the market. Macro drivers in the market including an aging population and an increasing awareness of womens health could also spur growth for the business. We also expect an increasing IUD (intrauterine device) utilization among Americans to help the segments top line as Paragard, Coopers IUD, controls roughly 17% of the domestic IUD market. There are currently five IUD options available in the U.S., and Paragard has enjoyed its stable share of the market as it is the only nonhormonal IUD available. But this could change as we might see a new nonhormonal IUD launch in the next five years.  ","We assign CooperCompanies a narrow moat because we believe the companys strong brand recognition and technically advanced products (intangibles), and patients unlikeness to move to a different product (switching costs) should continue to support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. For fiscal year 2022, CooperVision and CooperSurgical made up 68% and 32% of total sales, respectively. CooperVision is a pure-play contact lenses business unit. We assign the segment a narrow moat from intangible assets and switching costs. The segment is composed of four distinct lens types: reusable sphere, daily sphere, multifocal, and toric. Spherical lenses correct vision issues at one fixed distance while multifocal lenses correct at multiple distances and toric lenses correct astigmatism (an imperfection in the cornea of the eye). The U.S. contact lens market is more or less controlled by four players. Johnson and Johnson controls about 38% of the market, Alcon and The Cooper Companies both control roughly 25% each, and Bausch and Lomb controls 10%, with the remaining 2% shared by many smaller players. We believe Coopers contact lens business benefits from intangible assets due to superior products, the companys continued investment into the area, as well as its brand power. Cooper spends roughly 3.5% of total sales in research and development, and this allows the firm to invest in new technologies and bring new lenses to market. Coopers latest notable product is MiSight 1 day, the first and only FDA-approved (as of 2023) daily soft contact lenses for myopia management for children. Myopia, or nearsightedness, affects more than 40% of Americans, and it is increasingly becoming more prevalent with researchers suggesting more than half of the global population could be myopic by 2050. This is especially true for young people80 to 90% of children in some developed countries of Asia are myopic. Furthermore, Cooper has the worlds most comprehensive specialty contact lens portfolio with leading orthokeratology lenses (specially designed and fitted lenses) and scleral lenses (large-diameter gas permeable lenses) for myopia treatment. Cooper also has many patents that help maintain product differentiation across competitors. Coopers patented Aquaform technology, a technique used in its Biofinity (monthly) and Avaira (bi-weekly) families, implements both high oxygen transmissibility and a low modulus into its lenses, two factors that makes lenses softer and more flexible. We believe this innovation is one of many reasons why 24 million wearers choose one of Coopers lenses with Aquaform. With technologically advanced products and appropriate investment, Cooper has been able to get traction in growing its presence in a market that is relatively stagnant in terms of share movement. Since 2014, the company gained about 4% of market share. Management also noted that Cooper is a leader in new fits in the U.S. and the world and has been for some time. We also believe Cooper bolsters brand power through an evolutionary compounding of clinical and technical improvements in its products. The company fosters practitioner preference with scientific evidence proven by clinical studies, often spanning years. All of this effort by Cooper reinforces positive perception within its practitioner base which requires a lot of effort from a competitor to dismantle and convince otherwise. We also assign switching costs to Coopers contact lens business. In the U.S., a patient must get a prescription from an eye care professional (ECP) to purchase contact lenses, and each prescription is brand-specific. Most ECPs stick with just one or two brands because they have strong relationships with manufacturers due to brand loyalty and rebates. They are also unlikely to mix brands because they want to stick with and prescribe products that they are familiar with. A new patient looking to get contact lenses have to first get an eye exam at which point doctors will recommend a few products depending on vision correction needs, modality (lens wear schedule), and price point. Patients can then test them out before picking the one that most suit their needs. Each contact lens fits differently, and material behavior is different with all soft lenses, so once someone finds contact lenses that they enjoy wearing without any issues, it is highly likely that they will stick with the same ones year over year. And we see this in actionon average, a patient sticks with the same contact lenses for 7 years. Contact lenses typically come in six- or 12-month supplies, creating further disincentives to switch brands frequently. Also, once customers are comfortable with a product, they are unlikely to switch lenses unless they are trading up for superior products (for example, switching from monofocal to multifocal or toric). In fact, the contact lenses market is fairly resilient to macroeconomic conditions because they are seen as essential expenditures.CooperSurgical has two business units: Fertility and Office/Surgical. For fiscal year 2022, each unit made up 40% and 60% of total segment sales, respectively. While Coopers equipment and services in both business units contend for a moat with its broad coverage of the IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycle, we do not see enough evidence to confidently say that it will earn excess returns for the next 10 years. One of the segments most notable products is Paragard. Introduced in 1998, Paragard is made out of copper and is the only nonhormonal IUD in the U.S. Cooper acquired Paragard from Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2018 for $1.1 billion, and it makes up roughly 20% of total segment sales. Paragard has the longest effective duration (10 years) out of the five FDA-approved IUDs in the U.S. Paragard has enjoyed 30-plus years of domestic dominance in the nonhormonal IUD market due to the difficult approval process from the FDA (IUDs are regulated as drugs, instead of devices, which make it more costly, challenging, and time-consuming to get approved) as well as its patents. However, we now expect to see a new nonhormonal IUD named VeraCept (from Sebela Pharmaceuticals) enter the market within the next 10 years. As of 2023, VeraCept is undergoing phase 3 trials and is estimated to complete it during 2024. We do not see any meaningful characteristics of Paragard that separate itself from VeraCept. Outside the U.S., there are over 20 copper IUD options so Paragards dominance is not felt. Besides Paragard, CooperSurgical has facilities for monitoring activity in the IVF, stem cell storage services, and egg and sperm donor, and it also has a number of devices for womens health. In our view, no one device or a specific service that CooperSurgical offers materially differentiates itself from others.","We assign the Cooper Companies a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, which largely reflects our quantitative analysis of the firm based on the return ranges used by our star rating system and somewhat the competitive nature of the vision care market. Cooper controls roughly a quarter of the contact lens market. While shares shift slowly due to the high switching cost nature of the space, a scenario in which a potential big launch from its competitor stealing Coopers shares is not completely out of the picture. Cooper spends about 3% of sales in research and development, which is lower than other contact lens manufacturers who spend about 8%-10% of sales. Although we have not seen the company lag others in terms of product innovation, Cooper needs to continue improving its products and services to maintain its position in the market.We dont believe Cooper faces any material ESG risks. Since Coopers products deal with highly sensitive parts of a body, the company has to ensure high product quality and safety. Failure to meet the standards that its products have set and established could not only hurt potential users but also the companys brand reputation. However, we dont see this as a likely scenario due to Coopers proven track record of meeting all safety guidelines. ","We assign the Cooper Companies a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our view of Coopers sound balance sheet, fair investments, and mixed shareholder distribution ratings.We view Coopers balance sheet as sound, with medium unleveraged business risk. Revenue cyclicality is low as we view expenditures for contact lenses as stable regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. While potentially costly major vision correction surgeries, such as LASIK, might be delayed during a recessionary period, we believe cataract surgeries with monofocal intraocular lens replacement and some vitrectomies are fairly resistant to outside pressures because they are covered by most insurance, resulting in a relatively low out-of-pocket cost. Also, we see expenditures for contact lenses as part of everyday spending rather than discretionary since having correct vision is a need that doesnt tend to get overlooked, even in tough economies. While we do see fewer upgrades from reusable and monofocal to daily and special lenses during a difficult economic period, downgrading is rare. We view Coopers investments as fair. Cooper is not highly acquisitive and besides the Generate acquisition, which closed in 2021, the company has been careful taking on a major debt to cover any big purchases. Cooper purchased Generate for $1.7 billion, which was funded through a combination of $1.5 billion of new debt and available cash. While this level of debt is not very common for the company (this new debt exceeds Coopers annual long-term debt that it carried over the last 10 years) we dont think Cooper severely overpaid for the company. Generates trailing 12 month sales was roughly $250 million and a third of its operation is in fertility with others in cord blood and cord tissue storage, both businesses that we expect to grow mid- to high-single digits over the next five years. Generate also posts gross margin of 70%, which is roughly 500 basis points higher than CooperSugicals average gross margin over the last 10 years. Accounting for all of these factors, we think Generate will be highly complementary to CooperSurgicals business and further establish Cooper as one of leaders in the IVF space. We view Coopers shareholder distribution as mixed. Cooper pays $0.06 in dividends and has done so for the last 10 years. During this time, the company has averaged a 1% of payout ratio. Cooper also doesnt spend a meaningful amount of capital repurchasing shares. While we dont necessarily see this as a bad thing, we believe the company could more effectively utilize its excess capitals to return value to shareholders, either through higher dividend payments or greater share repurchases. ","The Cooper Companies is one of the largest eye care companies in the U.S. It operates in two segments: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision is a pure-play contact lens business and is composed of a suite of spherical, multifocal, and toric contact lenses. The company also has one of the most comprehensive specialty lens portfolios in the world. With brands including Proclear, Biofinity, MyDay, and clariti, Cooper controls roughly a quarter of the U.S. contact lens market. CooperSurgical, founded in 1990, is made up of equipment related to reproductive care, fertility, and womens care. Cooper has the broadest medical device coverage of the entire IVF cycle. It also has Paragard, the only hormone-free IUD in the U.S., and controls 17% of the U.S. IUD market. ","We believe the Cooper Companies is in fine financial health. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the company had roughly $140 million in cash and cash equivalent and about $2.5 billion of debt with $850 million set to mature in 2025 and $1.5 billion set to mature in 2026. Cooper took on the $1.5 billion debt to fund its acquisition of Generate Life Sciences, one of the leading providers of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments. We model the company to generate healthy cash flows over our forecast period and expect it to pay off its debt without issues at times of maturity. Coopers five-year average debt/EBITDA is 2.6, and we forecast a ratio below 2 by the end of our forecast period. We dont view Cooper as highly acquisitive but when it does acquire companies, it opts for small tuck-in purchases with recent acquisitions focused on adding more depth to its specialty contact lens portfolio. In the last five years, Cooper has purchased a few specialty lens manufacturers/distributors that market orthokeratology lenses and specialty contact lenses for myopia management. We expect Cooper to continue investing in lines of specialty lenses over the next five years, whether through internal research and development or through acquisitions.

24/11/2023,Airbnb's Platform Advantage Intact Amid Economic Uncertainty,Airbnb Inc,ABNB,3,02/11/2023,Dan Wasiolek,129.04,USD,23/11/2023,132.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,02/11/2023,"We dont expect to materially change our $132 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Airbnb after the company reported slightly better third-quarter results and guided its fourth-quarter sales in line with our forecast. Airbnbs booking growth was 17%, slightly ahead of our 15% forecast, with sales lifting 18%, edging our 16% estimate. Revenue was derived from a 14% increase in night volume (in line with our prognosis) and a daily rate rise of 3% (above our 1% expectation). Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Airbnb guided sales to grow 12%-14%, squaring with our 13% forecast, with rates expected to be up slightly and night growth targeted to decelerate some for the 14% rise in the third quarter. In the long term, we see ample drivers for the company to achieve the 12% average sales growth we estimate during 2024-32. For one, the platform is adding supply (up 19% in the third quarter) across all segments and regions, which should help drive future booking growth. Additionally, the companys penetration in most international markets remains below that in the U.S., and as the company looks to optimize product and marketing in these countries, bookings should follow. In this vein, Airbnbs recent efforts to expand in Germany, Brazil, and Korea have resulted in combined gross nights booked in these countries being 54% ahead of 2019s level. Also, many markets still have room to recover, with urban and cross-border representing 49% and 45% of total nights, respectively, compared with the prepandemic marks of 58% and 48%. Finally, Airbnbs platform should continue to be enhanced by new service and product offerings, such as boutique hotels and experiences in the future. Airbnbs profitability remains stout, with EBITDA margins at 54%, an improvement from the 51% achieved last quarter. Overall, we still expect EBITDA margins to equal 2022s 34.6% level in 2023 and expand to the high-30s by 2026, as Airbnb continues to drive cost efficiencies and leverage top-line growth.","Airbnbs network has reached critical-mass scale, supported by its leading booking share of the alternative accommodation market and ongoing expansion into experiences. Mobile application usage is increasing rapidly, and Airbnb has strong global awareness, which aids its roughly 90% of traffic that comes directly and through unpaid searches to its platform. Airbnb stands to benefit from worker flexibility driving higher long-term travel demand, aided by higher-income occupations in fields like technology, finance, legal, and architecture.","Booking and Expedia are investing in their U.S. alternative accommodation supply and awareness. Also, Google's continued emphasis on placing its paid ads and metasearch platform ahead of free organic search links could elevate marketing cost for Airbnb. Alternative accommodations face regulation headwinds around the industry's impact on society (resident quality of life), safety (adhering to codes), and economics (cost of living). Airbnbs core individual host alternative accommodation platform requires higher servicing costs than traditional hotels and other travel verticals.",02/11/2023,"We think that Airbnb's global online travel agency, or OTA, position will strengthen over the next decade, driven by a leading alternative accommodation network (source of its narrow moat) of over 4 million hosts and cumulative 1.4 billion guest arrivals since its start in 2008 through 2022. We think this network advantage will be supported by generative artificial intelligence investment and expansion into the experiences vertical over the next several years. Also, Airbnb is positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift to mobile bookings, witnessed by Airbnb being a top-10 iPhone travel app in 92 markets versus 23 for Expedia and 134 for Booking Holdings, according to App Annie on Oct. 30, 2023. Further, we expect some durability in remote working to enhance long-term travel demand. Mitigating our otherwise favorable view of Airbnbs network position in the online travel growth industry are competitive, regulatory, and structural cost threats. We expect Expedia and Booking's investment into the vacation rental industry to intensify during the next few years. Also, focused entry into the OTA market from Google, Alibaba, Amazon, and others could double the current handful of players that have dominant scale, leading to a meaningful impact on profitability. That said, replicating Airbnbs network would require significant time and expense, and we expect most of the aforementioned operators to deploy a metasearch model (which doesnt control hotel relationships) versus directly competing against Airbnb's OTA model (which does control hotel relationships). Beyond competitive threats, Airbnbs core alternative accommodation faces opposition concerned with the industry's impact on society (resident quality of life), safety (adhering to codes), and economics (cost of living). Regulation could place requirements (such as sharing personal information with local governments) and restrictions (such as the number days a listing can be rented out) on hosts and guests that reduces demand and elevates cost. And in addition to these regulatory costs, servicing individual vacation rental hosts can lift expenses compared with that found in the traditional accommodation industry.","Like narrow-moat companies Booking Holdings, Expedia, and Tripadvisor, we surmise that Airbnb has developed a two-sided marketplace network effect that it is able to properly monetize, thereby driving a narrow economic moat for the company. Airbnbs network advantage was established by attracting the fragmented marketplace of private accommodation owners to post their dwellings (supply side) on the companys platform, which in turn attracted more travelers (demand side) subsequently enticing more supply, creating a virtuous cycle that increases value for both new and existing users (hosts and guests).Airbnbs platform took time to reach a network advantage. In fact, it had to launch its platform a few times to generate an increased amount of interest, while resorting to aggressive marketing tactics like door-to-door communication and innovative engineering (links to Craigslist and Google AdWords that generated free or lower-cost advertising) before reaching critical-mass scale. Even when Airbnb launched its website for a third time on Aug. 11, 2008, it still had only 800 listings with an undisclosed number of bookings. However, continued investment into the platform and word of mouth drove an inflection point, where the network of hosts and guests entered a virtuous cycle. By March 2009, the company had 2,500 listings with 10,000 users, and by the end of 2010, around 700,000 cumulative nights had been booked on Airbnb, reaching 1.6 million by May 2011. Since then, Airbnbs network has continued to expand, reaching 6.7 million active listings with more than 1 billion cumulative guest arrivals, as of Dec. 31, 2022 (active listings were reported at around 7 million mid-2023).We believe Airbnbs platform hosts the industrys largest amount of individual rental owners, which are tough to aggregate given their fragmented nature, driving the supply side of its network advantage. In total, Airbnbs network actively lists over 7 million alternative accommodations across its 4 million hosts, 90% of which are individuals. Booking Holdings vacation rental supply is also around 7 million listings, although we estimate around half are property managers versus individual hosts, which are easier to aggregate. Meanwhile, Airbnbs content offering in the vertical sits well ahead of Expedias 2 million listings through its VRBO brand as well as other much smaller competitors.Airbnbs rental supply offering has driven strong user metrics, buoying the demand-side of its network advantage. In this vein, Airbnb is a top 10 travel iPhone app in 92 countries, versus 134 at Booking and 23 at Expedia, as of Oct. 30, 2023, according to App Annie. In 2022, Airbnbs platform saw 394 million rental room night bookings versus 895 million at Booking (rental and hotel combined), 312 million at Expedia (rental and hotel combined), and 1 million booked nights at MakeMyTrip (Tripadvisor and Trip.com dont report room nights).The supply and demand of Airbnbs platform has allowed the companys core alternative accommodations business to reach a critical-mass advantage, which we believe is achieved when a company garners at least 10% demand share of a market, at which point it becomes increasingly challenging for smaller competitors to catch up. This view is buoyed by Airbnbs $63 billion in alternative accommodation and experience bookings in 2022, equating to over 60% share using Euromonitors forecast for the short-term rental market. Airbnbs bookings in the vertical stand well above the estimated roughly $30 billion in 2022 for Booking Holdings, the number two player in the market. Overall, Airbnbs estimated 2022 bookings equate to 3% and 5% share of the total and online travel market, respectively, using Euromonitors forecast. This compares with Bookings estimated 2022 total and online booking share of 6% and 10%, respectively, and the 5% and 8% for Expedia (Tripadvisor, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip dont report booking figures).Airbnb, Booking, and Expedia have a large share of the online travel agency market, making it extremely challenging for any smaller competitor or new entrant to gain customer traffic or supplier scale. In fact, the next biggest peers, Trip.com (narrow moat) and MakeMyTrip (not rated), had sales of just one third and a mid-single-digit percentage compared with Airbnbs sales in 2022. Smaller competitors need substantial human capital to build relationships with travel suppliers as well as provide service and a user-friendly technology platform to customers. To this point, Airbnb used its strong cash flow generation to spend $2.6 billion, or 30% of its revenue, on operations, support, and product development in 2022. Direct spend comparisons to peers are not possible, due to varying reporting disclosures (Airbnb does not provide a breakout of personnel cost). That said, Booking Holdings spent $3 billion, or 18% of its revenue, on personnel expense and technology in 2022 (does not included overhead). This compared with $1.9 billion in technology and general administrative layout at Expedia, or 17% of its sales in 2022. These levels showcase the challenge smaller competitors face to match the spend of Airbnb, Booking, and Expedia. To illustrate, MakeMyTrips personnel expense (does not include overhead) in fiscal 2022 (March ending) was just $117 million, or 38% of its total revenue (the company does not disclose technology operating spending, although 1,300 of its 3,300 employees in fiscal 2022 were technology-related). Also, while Trip.com does not provide a breakout of personnel expense, its product development outlay in 2022 was $1.2 billion, or 42% of revenue.A successful travel network not only involves personnel and technology investments but also advertising expense to attract and retain traffic to the platform. Here, Airbnb spent $1.5 billion, or 18% of sales in 2022 on marketing, including both direct spending on marketing channels and indirect spending on marketing personnel. This compares with Booking, which spent $6 billion, or 35% of sales in 2022 on direct marketing, versus the $5.4 billion, or 47% of sales in 2022 at Expedia. Meanwhile, smaller competitors like MakeMyTrip laid out $51 million, or 17% of total revenue, on direct marketing in its fiscal 2022 (ending March), while Trip.coms direct and indirect marketing was $616 million, or 21% of sales, in 2022.The ability of Airbnb and its largest peers to spend behind their travel networks aids traffic scale, which further supports its network advantage by allowing it to test and implement platform changes quicker than smaller competitors, leading to an improved user experience and conversion. Here, we see that in September 2023, total monthly traffic to the airbnb.com domain was 89 million, according to SimilarWeb. This compares with traffic that month of 555 million to booking.com and 82 million to expedia.com (this is traffic only to these dot-com domains and doesnt represent other brands or geography domains controlled by these companies). For perspective, the domain makemytrip.com garnered 41 million in monthly traffic, while smaller online travel agency peers received even less domain traffic, making it tough for them to improve the user experience and conversion to the degree of Airbnb and other larger peers. One way to gauge how a travel platform is resonating with travelers is through the percent of traffic that comes direct to the network, as this signals users are aware of and find value in the customer experience, supporting network advantages. Encouragingly, in September 2023, 74% of Airbnbs traffic was direct, compared with 54% and 46% at narrow-moat peer domains booking.com and expedia.com. In our view, the high level of direct traffic to Airbnb not only is aided by the companys network advantage but also benefits from its namesake having become a verb in society.Airbnb generates healthy adjusted ROICs which we expect to average 33% over the next five years, well above our 9% average cost of capital estimate. Further, Airbnbs 21.5% operating margin in 2022and our forecast for expansion to the low 30s by 2027offers quantitative evidence of a competitive advantage.Despite its strong ROICs and operating margins, we dont believe Airbnb has carved a wide moat due to potential changes in technology that could alter the online travel landscape and meaningful competition beyond the next 10 years from existing and new entrants that already have the customer traffic and budgets to build network scale, which include Google, Meta, Alibaba, Amazon, and hotel consortia. In the past 15 years online travel industry platforms have had to adapt to the proliferation of mobile devices or risk losing share to peers. It is not hard to envision industry players having to stay in tune with the evolution of virtual reality, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other future technologies in the online travel industry. While we think it is likely no technology will alter economic profits for the next 10 years, we cant have a high degree of certainty this will be the case in more than 20 years. Focused entry from these competitors would double the current handful of players that have dominant scale, leading to commodification of the industry and a meaningful impact to margins. That said, we expect the market to support some level of increased competition over the next several years. The travel booking market remains large at $1.9 trillion, and we believe online penetration of the travel market can continue to expand the next 10 years from its current mid-60% level.","Airbnb's Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is High.The spread of COVID-19 represented a material headwind to travel demand in 2020, driving Airbnb's revenue down 30% in 2020. But even before the pandemic, the travel industry has been cyclical and affected by changes in economic growth. Additionally, terrorist attacks can lead to a near-term disruption in bookings. Moreover, potential European gatekeeper regulation could affect the competitive positioning of Airbnb and Booking. Also, changes to the innovation and lodging tax policy could increase tax provisions and working capital. Further, directors, executives, and 5%-plus stockholders combined have 90% voting control, which could hinder the ability of individual shareholders to effect operational change.Airbnbs core alternative accommodation market faces opposition concerned with the industry's impact on society (resident quality of life), safety (adhering to codes), and economics (cost of living). Regulation could entail guests and hosts sharing information with cities, having hosts register for a license to list on alternative accommodation platforms, limiting the amount of days a unit can be rented, and requiring units to meet safety standards. Further, Airbnb faces environmental, social, and governance risks around innovative tax code changes, data breaches, and potential fees should its platform be viewed as anticompetitive.Focused entry from Google, Amazon, Alibaba, and Facebook, and accelerated investment from Booking and Expedia could have a meaningful impact on Airbnbs growth.","Although we see Airbnbs balance sheet as sound, we view its investment strategy and shareholder distribution as fair, resulting in a Standard capital allocation ranking.Airbnbs balance sheet remains sound, given the company's medium revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. Further, we see plenty of financial flexibility, as we forecast Airbnb to retain a net cash position for the foreseeable future, and note the companys existing 0% convertible debt of roughly $2 billion, is not scheduled to mature until 2026, which we see as very manageable, given our expectation for $11 billion in free cash flow to the firm generation during 2023-27.We hold a fair view on Airbnb's investment strategy. We are favorable that the company is investing in building out its advantaged alternative accommodation. We applaud Airbnbs biannual innovation updates, which add guest and hosting tools, leading to an improved network experience. In this vein, leadership has made wise improvements to its mobile app, via adding flexible date and location search capability, which we think matches the industry's evolving landscape of enduring remote working conditions. Also, Airbnb is investing behind pricing tools, which should enhance the value proposition for both users and hosts. Additionally, Airbnb is planning to integrate generative artificial intelligence on its platform by 2024, which we think will further enhance network experience. Management has done well to turn what was an inefficient cost structure prior to COVID-19 to a lean model, removing meaningful marketing expense while still maintaining strong sales. This execution is supporting Airbnb's ability to invest back into product innovation, buttressing its network advantage. That said, we believe Airbnb should also be investing more into building out its experiences platform, as we see the company as well positioned to leverage its individual host network with offering unique and differientated things to do content.Additionally, while Airbnb's founders deserve credit for building an industry leading vacation rental platform, our fair view of management's investment capability is balanced by the company's beginnings having benefitted from favorable timing and its leadership continuing to advance along a learning curve, in our view. To illustrate, technology advancement opened an opportunity to improve the user experience that existed in the online alternative accommodation space at the time when Airbnb was established. For instance, Amazon Web Services (launched in 2006) allowed the founders to outsource data center processing needs at a lower cost than it would have been to build, enabling them to focus time and capital on the user experience. Additionally, the launch of the iPhone in 2007 began to allow for accessible search of places across the world at any moment, helping drive Airbnb's mobile platform and expand the marketplace. The timing was also right for the Airbnb concept from an economic and demographic standpoint. Coming out of the Great Recession, people were looking for cheaper travel options and ways to generate income, which room-sharing on Airbnb's platform offered. Also, millennials were seeking an alternative to the commoditized nature of many hotels, preferring to experience the local culture of a destination, which was provided by the neighborhood-hosted listings on Airbnb's network. Also, it is our stance that Airbnb management could have benefited from making more proactive versus reactive investments in regulatory and safety safeguards. As detailed in the book The Airbnb Story, the companys founders received business training from investors during its early establishment years, which guided the young entrepreneurs to reach out to the platform's users (arguably something they could have been doing more of initially), allowing them to use their skill sets and build an improved user experience. Also, one could argue that the founders lacked a full understanding of the market environment, as it wasn't until an Airbnb host notified the company of New York anti-room-sharing legislation in 2010. Having an upfront understanding of affordability issues that often framed anti-room-sharing laws across cities throughout the world could have allowed the company to partner earlier with local governments and develop legislation more favorable to the accommodations platform operator.Finally, we see Airbnb's shareholder distribution as appropriate, as the company refrains from paying dividend (something growth companies in growth industries tend to shy away from, given opportunity to invest into growth prospect). Airbnb started share repurchases in 2022, which we view as prudent, given the strong demand recovery and cash flow generation since the pandemic.","Started in 2008, Airbnb is the worlds largest online alternative accommodation travel agency, also offering booking services for boutique hotels and experiences. Airbnbs platform offered over 7 million active accommodation listings as of Sept. 30, 2023. Listings from the companys over 4 million hosts are spread over almost every country in the world. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 47% of revenue was from the North American region. Transaction fees for online bookings account for all its revenue.","We view Airbnbs financial health as extremely sound, and we believe the company has enough liquidity to operate at anemic travel demand levels for the foreseeable future, while still investing in key growth areas the next few years. Prior to COVID-19, Airbnb had no debt and over $3 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of 2019. To shore up its liquidity profile during the COVID-19 demand shock, Airbnb raised $1.8 billion in debt in April 2020, which was paid off and replaced with a 0% convertible senior note in March 2021, which is scheduled to mature in 2026. We view this capital raise as one done out of extreme precaution, and note the company had about $11 billion in pro forma cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2023.Given prudent investment opportunities in alternative accommodations and experiences over the next few years, we dont expect Airbnb to distribute a dividend for the foreseeable future. Further, Airbnb has started share repurchases in 2022, as demand visibility improves out of the pandemic and the company begins to more meaningfully leverage product and operational investments.",ABNB,Consumer Cyclical,86537830400.0,NMS,7424812.0,USD,129.0399932861328,True,0,131.02388260785412,146.2315426108259,1
24/11/2023,Acquisition of Sprint Wireline Brings Incremental Opportunity and Should Benefit Cogent,Cogent Communications Holdings Inc,CCOI,3,10/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,65.94,USD,23/11/2023,70.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,C,10/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Cogent Communications' reported third-quarter results convey little meaning, as the firm is working through its very atypical acquisition of the Sprint wireline business from T-Mobile. Cogent has completely integrated the Sprint wireline financials into its results. Now it is quickly shedding a sizable portion of the $500 million in annual Sprint revenue it acquired, as much of this business is unprofitable and bleeding cash, which is why Cogent is receiving $700 million over the next four years to take on the albatross. For the next several quarters at least, investors will have to parse managements commentary more than the quarterly results. Our long-term view, which is not nearly as enthusiastic as managements regarding potential sales growth, is unchanged, as is our $70 fair value estimate. Under any circumstance, we believe the netcentric business remains the growth engine for Cogent. Traffic on the network, which should be unaffected by the mid-second-quarter timing of the Sprint deal, grew 6% sequentially, a very strong seasonal result. Management said netcentric growth trends remain strong, as they are largely driven by growth in streaming video around the globe. In addition, we expect netcentric to be the biggest beneficiary, from a sales standpoint, from the Sprint acquisition. Management is excited about its newfound ability to sell wavelength, which mostly falls into the netcentric category. The firm had $3 million in wavelength revenue during the quarter, but it's quickly building out its capacity to meet demand and expects $20 million in wavelength sales by the second quarter of 2024, on its way to a $100 million annual run rate by the end of the year. However, even if wavelength sales reach these levels, we expect the rest of the Sprint revenue to remain in gradual decline, which is why we dont expect high sales growth for Cogent throughout our forecast.","Unburdened by legacy services or networks, Cogent can capitalize on the latest technologies without realizing excessive costs or cannibalizing more lucrative revenue streams. Cogent's low-cost structure, a byproduct of how it built its network, leaves other firms unable to profitably compete on pricing for comparable services. The cash infusion from taking on the legacy Sprint wireline business far exceeds the near-term losses that it will produce. The physical network Cogent received solidifies the cost advantage in its core business.","Deflationary pricing for internet transit, where Cogent is a market leader, will lead to diminishing profits on that business. A secular shift away from urban office buildings sparked by COVID-19 would be very detrimental for Cogent, as two thirds of its revenue is from corporate customers taking connections in those buildings. Cogent is tiny compared with its main competitors, which include the biggest telecom companies in North America. Those competitors' scale advantages will eventually enable them to undercut Cogent's prices for comparable services.",10/11/2023,"Cogent provides internet and private network connections for enterprises, and it carries internet traffic for internet service providers, content producers, and other websites. Both businesses face challenges as technological advancements allow those functions to be performed at lower cost, but we think Cogent's strategy leaves it positioned to succeed.  Cogent's advantages arose from its leased, low-cost, internet-specific network and the opportunistic buying it did to form its network. Rather than building a network itself by putting fiber into the ground, which we think often fails to justify the steep expense due to oversupply in many geographies, Cogent signed long-term leases to procure the rights. We think that advantage can persist now that Cogent has taken over the Sprint wireline network from T-Mobile. When combined with a network architecture that was optimized for the internet and a lack of legacy products to support, Cogent is in a superior position to most competitors, including major telecom companies. Cogent's network connects to more than 1,800 high-rise buildings in North America. It serves enterprise customers in those buildings only, as its model would not be profitable in less dense areas. Enterprises typically seek connections for both internet service and private networks. Private networks have evolved significantly in recent years, as firms can use internet-based, virtual solutions rather than more expensive legacy products. This shift is shrinking the market, but Cogent's lack of legacy offerings leaves it with more opportunity rather than the shrinking prospects of the industry. Internet transit is a small addressable marketabout $1.5 billion, according to Cogentand rapid price deflation mutes market growth despite the huge increases in data consumption. The small market has driven some competitors away and likely will keep others at bay, as they wouldn't be able to compete without an existing low-cost network like Cogent has.","We believe Cogent has a narrow moat based on a cost advantage, which stems both from a smart and fortuitous compilation of its physical network, which consists of about 100,000 route miles of fiber (roughly 60% intercity and 40% metro), and from the technology and equipment that the firm uses to light the network. Cogent decided from its inception to construct a network solely to accommodate internet communication, which has increasingly become the preferred mode of communication versus the more expensive and less efficient services that legacy telephone and cable companies provide. With that vision, Cogent began putting together a network two decades ago for far less cost than we believe a firm could today, and its singular focus on internet communication results in lower operating costs as well.In our view, Cogent's biggest advantage is the relatively low capital outlay that was required to put together its underlying network, which the firm says is the most interconnected network in the world, connecting to nearly 7,000 other networks (30 are settlement-free peers, while the remainder are customers) and carrying more than 20% of the world's internet traffic. Cogent also has over 1,800 skyscrapers on its network in North America, where it connects corporate customers. Rather than building the network itself, Cogent put together its network by leasing indefeasible rights of use, or IRUs, from network owners for unused, or dark, fiber. It enhanced its network shortly after the tech and telecom bubble burst at the beginning of the century, when, for a few hundred million dollars, it was able to lease capacity from or acquire financially distressed companies that had invested billions of dollars building networks. Cogent's IRUs have an average remaining life of around 20 years and come from over 200 different network suppliers. As a result, Cogent's capital spending now consists primarily of maintenance costs and equipment upgrades, and its capital intensity is materially lower than competitors. Capital spending as a percentage of sales has been 10% or less each of the last five years and is generally declining, as equipment pricing is often deflationary. This advantage has led to a relatively low invested capital base, especially since the accounting lives (for depreciation purposes) of many assets are shorter than the actual useful lives.Beyond the physical footprint, Cogent's network architecture leads to an operating expense cost advantage. Cogent runs a homogenous network, built exclusively to offer internet connections and carry the traffic over its network. Cogent's competitors typically provide multiple services to enterprises, including voice, and use legacy technologies, such as MPLS-based VPNs (multiprotocol label switching-based virtual private networks). Internet-based technologies and software solutions are replacing those services and causing those markets to dramatically shrink. Legacy networks also face more costs to accommodate the explosion in volume that is accompanying internet use (transit bit volume has been growing 25% annually for the last 25 years), and given the deflationary pricing environment for internet transit, competitors have been leaving, rather than entering the transit business. Cogent's more focused product portfolio results in a lower operating cost structure and a leaner back office, and without legacy products or technologies, Cogent can more easily adopt new and cheaper technology. Competitors' disadvantages do not stem solely from legacy networks; they are a product of their differing business models. According to Cogent, internet transit is only a $1.5 billion total market, and internet-based enterprise services are a $9 billion market, compared with tens of billions for voice and MPLS services. Legacy competitors must build their networks with an eye toward optimizing the bulk of their businesses, whereas Cogent can focus exclusively on carrying internet traffic. We think traditional carriers are unlikely to undertake significant spending to eliminate Cogent's cost advantage on businesses that for them are declining dramatically and where the total addressable markets are relatively small. Further, Cogent has indicated that its business model is only economical in the densest areas (about 10% of rentable office space), so we think legacy carriers are more likely to put their resources into the 90% of offices where they face less competition.With that backdrop, it might seem likely that competitors that are unburdened by legacy networks could more readily replicate Cogents business, but we believe that leads back to the favorable terms Cogent originally secured for its network. With a $1.5 billion addressable internet transit market that is not likely to grow much, since price deflation has typically offset traffic growth, and an enterprise market that is geographically dispersed and shrinking due to technological advances, we think it would be too expensive for new competitors to cobble together economical networks today. They would not have the advantage Cogent had 20 years ago, when top providers in a more nascent internet business were phone and cable companies, and fiber assets could be procured on the cheap due to the collapse of the tech and telecom bubble.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Cogent is Medium. Changes in technology and a permanent shift in office worker attendance could cause headwinds, but as a leading firm carrying internet traffic, Cogent should see much of its business exhibit stable growth.We expect Cogent to be immune from many of the challenges that could befall owners of corporate office buildings, but theres still risk related to permanently fewer corporate offices and the manner in which office workers work. In a perfect storm, there would be a reduced need for connections, particularly for VPNs. If the work-from-home phenomenon keeps buildings that Cogent connects more vacant than we expect, the company would face even greater challenges. About 55% of Cogents sales stem from providing internet and private connections for corporate customers in urban high-rise buildings, and we project significant growth opportunities with those customers. A widespread reduction in that market would materially alter our sales forecast.In our view, Cogents biggest environmental, social, and governance risk is that of a data or security breach, given that the firm is one of the biggest internet transit providers in the world and runs corporate networks, resulting in individuals and corporations most sensitive information in its care. While we think the risk of a monumental breach is low, the financial and reputational damage that could result from a severe security breach could be devastating, especially if it were due to company negligence.We believe another risk for Cogent is the level of dependence it has on founder and CEO Dave Schaeffer and its seeming lack of a succession plan. We attribute much of the firm's success to Schaeffer and think the stock would suffer if he left.","We assign Cogent an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, driven by what we see as an exceptional philosophy regarding shareholder distributions and a historically very smart investment strategy. We also take into account the shape of Cogents balance sheet and outlook for investments.Cogent has modestly raised its dividend every quarter for more than 10 years, leading to 15% average annual dividend growth since 2015. The dividend has accounted for over 100% of free cash flow for the past several years, so we dont think the company should raise it any more aggressively, but with low reinvestment needs, we dont think its problematic. The component we like best about managements shareholder distribution policy is how it handles share buybacks, typically engaging in them significantly when the stock is depressed and laying off after periods of significant appreciation. The firm spent $60 million on share repurchases in 2008 during the Great Recession and has not exceeded that level since. It came closest in 2014 and 2015, when the market experienced downturns. The firm repurchased virtually no shares in 2018 or 2019, when the stock was going straight up, but began repurchasing shares again in the second half of 2020, when the stock was down over 30% from its highs. We think management has created significant shareholder value through its discerning attitude toward share repurchases, and we expect that to continue.Management has handled acquisitions in a similar manner, creating significant value to shareholders over the years by buying only opportunistically. Cogent bought 13 companies in the wake of the telecom bubble from 2001 through 2004. It also nearly doubled the size of its network footprint from the end of 2007 to 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, after the size of its footprint had been steady since 2004. Apart from those periods of industry distress, Cogent has acquired almost nothing, as it didnt see accretive opportunities. In 2023, Cogent acquired Sprints wireline business from T-Mobile and will receive $700 million over the next four to five years for doing so. We believe the cash Cogent will receive more than offsets the declining portion of that business, making it another shrewd move. We think shareholders are served well by managements judgment and will continue to benefit if attractive opportunities arise.","Cogent carries over one fifth of the world's internet traffic over its network and is a broadband provider for businesses. Cogent's corporate customers are in high-rise office buildings; the firm provides them with two types of connections: dedicated internet access, which connects them to the internet, and virtual private networking, which offers an internal network for employees in different locations. Cogent's corporate customers are exclusively in North America and account for over half of the firm's revenue. Cogent's netcentric customers include internet service providers and content providers, to which Cogent provides internet transit. They hand traffic to Cogent in data centers and rely on Cogent to deliver it. About half of netcentric revenue is from outside the U.S.","Cogents leverage ratio has ticked up the past few years, but the firm maintains a large cash position and doesnt have any debt maturing until 2026. Our biggest cash concern is that if business doesnt pick up, Cogent may need to put a stop to the quarterly dividend increases that it has implemented each quarter for more than 10 years.At the end of 2022, Cogent had $275 million in cash and $1.25 billion in debt, including $300 million in capital leases. Of the nearly $1 billion in borrowings, about half matures in 2026, and half matures 2027. Cogents net debt/EBITDA ratio, including the capital leases, was 4.0 at the end of 2022.Cogent has recently been returning more than 100% of its free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) to shareholders via its regular dividend. A payout ratio above 100% is not maintainable long term, but we don't think the dividend is in danger unless business severely deteriorates.We think Cogent has the flexibility to acquire assets, but we don't expect it to do so unless the market presents an opportunity. History says the firm will be patient when assessing its options, and it is not averse to maintaining a sizable cash balance.",CCOI,Communication Services,3182427648.0,NMS,364312.0,USD,65.94000244140625,True,0,65.32011781580589,72.6702470661642,1
24/11/2023,We Believe That Cloudflare Stands to Benefit From Secular Trends Such as AI and Edge Computing,Cloudflare Inc,NET,3,03/11/2023,Malik Khan,73.68,USD,23/11/2023,60.0,Very High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,03/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $60 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Cloudflare after the firm reported strong third-quarter results and guidance mostly in line with our expectations. Earlier this year, the company highlighted sales execution challenges that had hampered its financial results and guidance. Since then, we believe that it has rebounded, posting strong top-line growth and improved profitability against a tough macro backdrop while working to improve its sales personnel challenges. We view the shares as fairly valued, trading in 3-star territory. Cloudflares top line for the third quarter clocked in at $336 million, up 32% year over year and 9% sequentially. Driving some of this growth was a 34% increase in large customers, defined as those spending more than $100,000. Cloudflare added 206 new large customers, the highest number in five quarters. The company also added a record number of customers with annual spending of $500,000 and $1,000,000 or more. We attribute the strong customer additions to a revamped sales team, which had faced execution challenges earlier this year. Management highlighted a 60% increase in the pipeline generated by the new salespeople compared with the underperforming salespeople whom they replaced. We see these metrics as evidence that the company is taking the right steps to improve its execution, which we see as even more important during this period of macro uncertainty. Cloudflare expanded adjusted operating margin to 12.7%, up 690 basis points year over year. We see a rapid margin increase as evidence of the company's strong unit economics as well as operational discipline. Over the long term, we forecast robust margin expansion as the business scales up and is able to distribute costs over a larger revenue base.","Cloudflare has strong tailwinds behind its back as edge computing becomes more prevalent. Cloudflares security business is set to grow at a fast clip due to the overall security spend of enterprises going up as they deal with more complex security issues. Cloudflare has a long runway for growth in terms of enterprise penetration in its security business.
","Cloudflare is in direct competition with well-established, far larger incumbents such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in the edge computing space.
 Cloudflare is unprofitable on a GAAP profitability and may not achieve it for a few more years. We believe that Matthew Prince, the firms founder and CEO, is a hugely influential person in the firm. If he were to leave or retire, Cloudflares future strategy and execution could suffer.",10/02/2023,"We believe Cloudflare is poised for success in both the web security and edge computing spaces. As a security-focused content delivery network (CDN), Cloudflare stands to benefit from increased cybersecurity spend. Currently, more than 10% of global internet traffic goes through Cloudflares network, with more than one quarter of all websites in the world using Cloudflare. We expect cybersecurity to be increasingly relevant for firms across the globe as cyberattacks continue to increase. However, we think Cloudflare is capable of much more than security, and we view edge computing as a major opportunity for the firm.  As a CDN, Cloudflare delivers internet traffic from the points of origination to delivery in a quick, efficient manner. At the same time, the firm can monitor copious amounts of internet activity, analyze impending threats, and move traffic around to ensure speed and security. The firms distributed network structure, as a security-focused CDN, has network effects built into it. The data generated by its users help Cloudflare track internet activity and improve its offerings related to web performance and security, leading to more data being channeled through Cloudflares network.  As we look at the future, we think edge computing is a paradigm shift in how enterprises manage their data-related workflows. Instead of workflows being processed in a large data center, they can be dealt with at edge nodes closer to end users, thereby cutting down on the average response time. While both the security and the edge computing space remain competitive, we think Cloudflares unique infrastructure, sticky product portfolio, and strategy of investing heavily in sales and research give the firm a competitive edge in both spaces.  We also view the firms strategy of targeting larger clients as a step in the right direction as larger clients tend to be stickier and have larger annual contract values (ACVs). Further, with a proven ability to move clients along the upselling schedule, as evidenced by the firms strong net revenue retention, we view Cloudflare as having strong long-term growth prospects. ","We believe Cloudflare merits a narrow moat rating owing primarily to strong switching costs and network effects associated with its product offerings and core business. When analyzing Cloudflare, we find ourselves looking at two different companies. The first one is Cloudflare of today: a security-focused content delivery network (CDN) that channels more than 10% of global internet traffic. The second one is what we think Cloudflare is setting itself up to become: a player in the public cloud space and a beneficiary of the edge computing megatrend. With an increasingly large target addressable market (TAM), expanding upselling abilities, and a sticky product portfolio, we believe Cloudflare is more than likely to generate excess returns over the next 10 years and, therefore, merits a narrow economic moat.For a security-oriented company, Cloudflare has a unique distributed, serverless structure. Essentially, by having infrastructure in more than 250 cities across the globe, Cloudflare delivers internet traffic from the points of origination to delivery in a quick, efficient manner. At the same time, the firm can monitor copious amounts of internet activity, analyze impending threats, and move traffic around to ensure speed and security. Think of a typical distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack which overloads the targets servers with activity and therefore crashes them. If a servers bandwidth is a highway, DDoS seeks to block this highway, thus impeding any traffic on it. Cloudflares distributed network allows the firm to move traffic around until the increased activity subsides. For some perspective of the scale at play--Cloudflare blocks more than 100 billion cyber threats a day using its distributed network.When considering the firms security business, the customer switching costs are apparent. Security spend is sticky, in our opinion. Customers that adopt security solutions do so to take uncertainty off the table--switching vendors often brings uncertainty back into play. Even while most of its clients are small- to medium-sized businesses, Cloudflares gross retention has remained above 90%--implying a customer lifetime of more than 10 years. At the same time, by upselling its customers into buying more security and performance modules, Cloudflare has a net retention rate above 120%. We expect increased customer stickiness as the firm expands its footprint by targeting bigger clients, a vertical where it is finding increased success.Cloudflares distributed network structure has network effects built into the platform. Currently, more than 10% of global internet traffic goes through Cloudflares network, with more than one quarter of all websites in the world using Cloudflare. The data generated by these websites help Cloudflare track internet activity and improve its offerings related to web performance and security, leading to more data being channeled through Cloudflares platform and more websites using Cloudflare. Cloudflare also lets small websites use its basic security offerings for free. We do not view this move as altruistic but rather a means of trafficking more data, which Cloudflare can then utilize to improve its products and security apparatus. From a product development perspective, these free users also allow Cloudflare to test new products and methods of managing internet traffic in a real-life scenario. All in all, as more data flows through Cloudflares network, the security offerings improve along with the increased traffic. The security improvements then attract more traffic, and the virtuous cycle continues.Quantitatively, despite the firms heavy spending on research and sales, Cloudflares security business consistently produces excess returns on invested capital. Further, the company has been investing heavily in areas of high growth within the security space. Two key growth verticals that we see as pertinent when thinking about Cloudflares overall security offerings, and their respective stickiness, are email routing and zero-trust security. Both of these growth verticals are poised to grow rapidly. Cloudflares current offerings in these verticals have seen high adoption, which improves Cloudflares overall value proposition and helps the firm create switching costs by selling more modules to existing/new clients. Even if we were to ignore Cloudflares future ambitions as more than a security-focused CDN, wed merit the firm with an economic moat due to the strong switching costs and network effects associated with its offerings. However, we think Cloudflare is more than just security and performance enhancement.The biggest opportunity that we think Cloudflare stands to benefit from is edge computing, a natural fit for the firms distributed network structure. Edge computing represents a paradigm shift in storing, analyzing, and utilizing data. If the public cloud is a tree, the leaves on individual branches can be thought of as edge nodes. With edge computing, instead of asking the cloud data center to process all workflows, many of them can be executed on these edge nodes, improving response times and saving bandwidth. For example, if an individual asks a Google Home device to check the weather outside, instead of that request being processed at a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data center, it can be dealt with by a GCP node close to the users location--thereby eliciting a faster response to the user. For a company to harness the power of edge computing, having a distributed network of edge nodes, such as that of Cloudflares, is a prerequisite. Currently, edge computings primary use is for applications such as gaming or high-level Internet of Things (as illustrated in the GCP example above). These applications typically require functions to be run on the edge while complex workflows are processed at the cloud data centers. This distribution of workloads makes sense as edge nodes do not have enough computing power to process complex workflows. However, edge computing is set to become more pervasive through harnessing the true potential of 5G. As we think of the next decade and beyond, we view 5G, complex Internet of Things, and their related edge computing use cases as secular megatrends. While all three major public cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) have their own CDNs, the geographic expanse of their offerings is far smaller than Cloudflares network. We do not see this current advantage as durable, however. We expect these major cloud providers to attempt to build their own networks that will eventually match the breadth of Cloudflares network. To build a distributed network, these public cloud behemoths will have to change their delivery model with centralized data centers giving way to a distributed network. Even if we assume that these public cloud giants are able to build these distributed networks, one roadblock these providers are bound to hit, which we see as Cloudflares true opportunity in this space, is an increasing enterprise aversion to cloud vendor lock-in. After renting space from these major public cloud providers for many years, enterprises are beginning to realize that getting their own data out of these vendors can result in egregious egress fees (essentially the cost of taking your data back from these big cloud providers). This dynamic, as proven by the increased adoption of multi-cloud strategies by large enterprises, primes the industry for disruption. We view Cloudflares disruption stemming from its ability to leverage its distributed network by providing enterprise clients a way to operate without the threat of cloud-provider monopsony. We expect businesses to send more workflows to be processed at the edge over time. However, developers that wish for workflows to be processed at the edge are hampered by their ability to do so if the edge platform vendor is different than their public cloud vendor. To remediate this reluctance due to the lack of interoperability, every major public cloud provider (except Amazon) has signed up for a Cloudflare-led Bandwidth Alliance that allows users to transfer data from one provider to another for free/a nominal fee. As we think about Cloudflares edge computing platform, we view the general move within the cloud space toward lower egress fees favorably. The overall reduction in egress fees (including by Amazon) allows developers to use a hybrid, mix-and-match strategy with edge computing and public cloud vendors not necessarily being the same.One may question as to why public cloud vendors would willingly sign up to an agreement that reduces their own switching costs, but we believe that edge computing is not a replacement to the public cloud. We think of edge computing as augmenting and enhancing the public cloud by offloading tasks that are either time or cost sensitive. Developers, that often are primary users of these public cloud vendors, are increasingly critical of egress fees as these fees pigeon-hole their workflows into less efficient offerings. With edge computing not posing an existential threat to public cloud, and the vendors users demanding interoperability, we view the decision of public cloud vendors to reduce/remove egress fees as sensical. We think that as edge computing becomes more prominent over the next decade, there will be increased adoption by enterprises that are setting out multi-year infrastructure strategies. We think the edge computing opportunity will be large and Cloudflare does not need to be a winner-take-all or winner-take-most to be a beneficiary. For perspective, according to Grand View Research and our own estimates, the current public cloud market and edge computing space is projected to grow well beyond $700 billion over the next five years. We think Cloudflares blend of security and edge computing will allow the firm to capture a portion of this TAM. We also believe that the companys combined offerings can enhance its existing network effect and switching costs, thereby solidifying its economic moat.","We assign Cloudflare a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating due to the nascent nature of its competitive, high-growth markets.In its core security business, Cloudflare faces competition from other cloud-first security businesses such as ZScaler. At the same time, Akamai, a CDN pioneer, has also invested heavily in building up its security portfolio. In the edge computing space, it is hard to eschew the David and Goliath comparisons as the company competes with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.While Cloudflare is far from being the only technology company running GAAP losses, we do not expect the bottom line to turn black any time soon. We also think Cloudflare is prone to key-man risk. Matthew Prince, Cloudflares founder and CEO, is largely responsible for Cloudflares vision and strategy. If he were to leave or retire, there could be upheaval in Cloudflares disruptive abilities.We do not see any material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues for Cloudflare. However, as firm with a big presence in cybersecurity, notable potential risks include attracting and retaining talent (amid a talent shortage in the security space), data privacy, and data security. ","We assign Cloudflare an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on its sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.We think Cloudflares balance sheet is in good shape, and we are not overly concerned by the firms use of leverage. We believe that the firms sticky product portfolio and investment in its edge computing platform will drive strong cash flow generation for the firm. We also view the firms spend on cybersecurity as relatively recession resistant--we do not foresee clients slashing their security budgets, even during tough macroenvironments. This downside protection should enable the firm to maintain a healthy balance sheet in the future.We rate Cloudflares investment strategy as exceptional. The firms ability to organically produce high-quality products is impressive. Cloudflare has a specific research team called emerging technology and incubation (ETI), and this group is responsible for developing technologies that will propel Cloudflares business forward. An illustrative example of ETIs success is Cloudflares edge computing platform, Workers, which began as an ETI project and is currently a leader in the edge computing platform space.Since Cloudflare is in a high-growth phase, the company does not pay its shareholders a dividend and has largely stayed away from share repurchases. We see this strategy as appropriate given the firms long-term growth trajectory.","Cloudflare is a software company based in San Francisco, California, that offers security and web performance offerings by utilizing a distributed, serverless content delivery network, or CDN. The firms edge computing platform, Workers, leverages this network by providing clients the ability to deploy, and execute code without maintaining servers.","We believe Cloudflares financial position is healthy. Cloudflare ended fiscal 2022 with more than $1.65 billion in cash and current investments. While the firm has more than $1 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet as well, we believe Cloudflares cash generation over our explicit forecast will far outstrip its commitments over the same time period. We expect Cloudflare to generate strong free cash flow margins as it increases its operating leverage while driving its top line forward. The firms CEO, Matthew Prince, likened operating margins to a game of flappy bird-with a growth companys job to keep margins somewhere between too high and too low. We concur as the firms long-term opportunity is big enough to sacrifice dollars today at the altar of more dollars in the future. Going forward, we do not expect to see a material change in Cloudflares capital structure. In a tight macroenvironment, we expect the firm to raise capital by issuing more equity.",NET,Technology,26452117504.0,NYQ,3532507.0,USD,73.68000030517578,True,0,63.016352754482355,87.04629620210494,1
24/11/2023,DTE's Growth Could Get Boost From New Michigan Clean Energy Legislation,DTE Energy Co,DTE,4,22/11/2023,Travis Miller,104.66,USD,23/11/2023,117.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,B,22/11/2023,"We are reaffirming our $117 fair value estimate and narrow moat rating for DTE Energy after meeting with management to discuss DTE's pending electric rate review and new clean energy legislation in Michigan. DTE's stock has traded near our fair value estimate for most of 2023, but has fallen 10% since July and now trades at a 12% discount to our fair value estimate, cheaper than the sector overall. Its 3.7% dividend yield is in line with the sector average, but we expect a dividend increase this quarter that will likely lift the yield to 4% at the current stock price. Constructive rate regulation in Michigan is key for DTE to achieve our 6% annual earnings growth forecast and potentially reach the high end of management's previous 6%-8% growth target. However, DTE's current electric rate review has been unusually contentious, with proposed rate rises ranging from DTE's updated customer rate increase request of $580 million to an administrative law judge's $290 million recommendation. We assume regulators approve 60% of DTE's request using its current 9.9% allowed return on equity. Management plans to update its capital investment and growth plan following the regulator's electric rate case ruling. We forecast DTE will invest $23 billion during the next 5 years. That could increase if state regulators approve DTE's proposed 5-year, $9 billion distribution grid plan and investments to support Michigan's clean energy legislation signed on Nov. 8. The legislation's 60% renewable energy requirement by 2035, up from 15% now, and 100% clean energy requirement by 2040 offers DTE opportunities to accelerate its investments in renewable energy, carbon capture, and battery storage. The legislation also supports earnings growth by allowing DTE to earn a return on the contracts it signs with third-party renewable energy owners. This is rare among U.S. utilities. We continue to assume 7% annual dividend growth for at least the next few years.","Shareholders received a 7.6% annual dividend increase for 2023. We expect 6% annual dividend growth for the foreseeable future. Michigan's aging utility infrastructure needs investment, which means ample growth opportunities for DTE's gas and electric utilities. Over the past 10 years, Michigan regulation has been constructive for shareholders and we expect it to remain favorable. ","Although changes to Michigan's regulatory framework were signed into law in late 2016, DTE still faces regulatory lag based on the timing of rate case filings. DTE's regulated utilities primarily serve Detroit and the surrounding metropolitan area whereas other utilities have more economically diversified service territories. Higher interest rates and inflation could raise DTE's financing and operating costs while making the dividend less attractive.",16/11/2023,"A decade-long transformation of Michigan's utility regulation and DTE Energy's business mix sets up the company for a long runway of growth investment opportunities. The clean energy transition is the cornerstone of this growth. Michigan's utility rate regulation has turned mostly constructive for investors in recent years, resulting in earnings growth and investment at DTE Energy's electric and gas utilities. DTE's 2022 electric rate review suggests utility rate regulation in Michigan remains constructive. The 2023 rate review has been more challenging, but we don't think it signals a significant change in regulatory support. We expect DTE's electric and gas utilities will contribute roughly 90% of DTE's operating earnings based on an average $4 billion annual capital investment during the next five years. Capital investments could total $50 billion during the next 10 years based on requirements to replace and upgrade energy infrastructure in eastern Michigan. DTE Electric is investing heavily in gas power generation and renewable energy to replace its aging coal fleet. DTE's 20-year integrated resource plan settlement in mid-2023 targets 6.5 gigawatts of new solar generation and 8.9 GW of new wind generation while eliminating coal. New clean energy legislation in late 2023 likely will accelerate clean energy investments to meet the state's 100% clean energy standard by 2040. In the near term, DTE's gas and electric rate reviews support our 6% annual earnings growth forecast, in line with management's 6%-8% target. Commissioners have supported a 9.9% allowed return on equity at DTE's gas and electric utilities, a level we think supports growth while moderating customer bill impacts. DTE's renamed nonutility business, DTE Vantage, is only about 10% of normalized earnings following the July 2021 splitoff of DT Midstream. We expect the unit to house a growing portfolio of clean energy investments. DTE's board has raised the dividend twice since the reset following the DTM spinoff in mid-2021, most recently a 7.6% increase for 2023. We expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings for the foreseeable future.","Service territory monopolies and efficient-scale advantages are the primary sources of economic moat for regulated utilities such as DTE Electric and DTE Gas. State and federal regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks.In exchange for regulated utilities' service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow regulated utilities to earn greater than their costs of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing.Intuitively, utilities should have an economic moat based on efficient scale, but in some cases regulation offsets this advantage, preventing excess returns on capital. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions precludes most regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moats to many regulated utilities.We expect the company's nonutility segment will represent less than 10% of earnings in the long run. On balance, we believe the nonutility segment is not large enough to change DTE's overall narrow moat rating.","Regulatory risk is our primary source of uncertainty since more than 90% of operating earnings come from regulated utilities in Michigan following the DT Midstream spinoff in 2021.DTE management generally has been successful in recent years convincing regulators that Michigan needs energy infrastructure investments and that higher customer rates are necessary to fund those investments. Electricity demand, economic constraints, clean energy policies, and regulatory oversight could change DTE's investment opportunities. Persistent inflation could slow earnings growth and earned returns on capital.DTE faces ESG risk, particularly given its relatively large coal fleet and its natural gas distribution system. DTE Electric is addressing its ESG risk with plans to retire its coal fleet and replace that generation with renewable energy. The company has proposed a pathway to retire all coal generation by 2032, which we think regulators will support. DTE plans to replace the coal units with the new 1,000 MW Blue Water gas-fired plant and new wind and solar generation.This shift toward low-emissions power generation could accelerate following state legislation signed in late 2023 that mandates a 60% renewable energy requirement by 2035, 2.5 giawatts of utility-scale battery storage, and a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.DTE Gas is also working to reduce emissions and is targeting net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The natural gas distribution utility is renewing infrastructure and making operational improvements to reduce GHGs and also participating in energy efficiency programs for customers. We expect DTE to expand its investments in renewable natural gas.DTE Vantage also is contributing to decarbonization with its investments outside of the utilities, including two proposed carbon-capture projects.","We assign DTE a Standard capital allocation rating reflecting management's plan to allocate most of its capital investment to its regulated gas and electric utilities in Michigan, where returns are for the most part predictable and operating costs are low.Management has been able to secure regulatory support for most of its long-term investment plans, including its electric integrated resource plan settlement in mid-2023. DTE's focus on reducing carbon emissions through coal plant retirements and investments in renewable energy has gained widespread regulatory and political support.We believe the spinoff of the midstream business in mid-2021 was a good capital allocation decision for shareholders, providing more capital flexibility to fund investments at its rate-regulated utilities.In mid-2019, CEO Jerry Norcia succeeded Gerry Anderson, who serves as executive chairman. Norcia's biggest challenge is gaining regulatory and customer support to implement clean energy policymaking that will require DTE to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions. DTE has achieved constructive regulatory outcomes thus far.Norcia joined DTE in 2002 as president of its former midstream business and also held the positions of president of DTE Gas and DTE Electric. Anderson was the architect of one of the most successful nonutility strategies in the industry during his tenure. Norcia contributed to that success, but we expect Norcia to turn most of his attention to the regulated utilities.","DTE Energy owns two regulated utilities in Michigan that contribute 90% of earnings. DTE Electric serves approximately 2.3 million customers in southeastern Michigan, including Detroit. DTE Gas serves 1.3 million customers throughout the state. In addition, DTE has nonutility businesses and investments including energy marketing and trading, renewable natural gas facilities, and on-site industrial energy projects.","We expect DTE's book debt/capital ratio to remain near 60% for the foreseeable future. This leverage is not a concern considering about 90% of consolidated earnings are from its utilities with constructive regulatory frameworks following the spinoff of its midstream business in July 2021.We forecast stable interest coverage ratios during the next five years, with EBITDA/interest expense near 5 times. This is in line with other diversified utilities that derive the majority of earnings from regulated operations.We think DTE can grow the dividend at least 6% annually. The board has topped that growth rate with a 7% increase for 2022 and a 7.6% increase for 2023. We expect management to continue targeting a 65% payout ratio on weather-normalized earnings. This is in line with payout ratios for most U.S. utilities.",DTE,Utilities,22311036928.0,NYQ,2735208.0,USD,104.66000366210938,True,1,102.62729384478587,108.01938271228148,1
24/11/2023,American Water Works: Strong Management Execution Supports Regulatory Relationships,American Water Works Co Inc,AWK,4,02/11/2023,Andrew Bischof,130.47,USD,23/11/2023,137.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,B,02/11/2023,"We are reaffirming our $137 per share fair value estimate after American Water reported third-quarter operating earnings of $1.66 per share, compared with $1.63 in the same year-ago period. Management reaffirmed its 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82, in line with our expectations. Management initiated 2024 EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20, in line with our $5.15 estimate. Management also reaffirmed and extended their long-term 7%-9% earnings growth and dividend growth outlook through 2028. Our earnings outlook through 2027 is at the midpoint of this guidance. At the beginning of the year, we viewed American Water as 18% overvalued. With the stock down 22% year to date, far outpacing the utilities sector 16% decline, we now view shares as attractive, trading at a 10% discount to our fair value as of Nov. 2. The company announced its updated capital investment plan totaling $16 billion to $17 billion from 2024-28, a sizable step up from the company's previous five-year $14 billion to $15 billion investment program. Management's ability to continue to identify capital investment opportunities supports our view that American Water has one of the best long-term growth profiles in the sector. Achieving constructive regulatory outcomes will be important to support the company's new capital investment program. The company continues to have a busy regulatory schedule. We continue to expect management to achieve favorable outcomes throughout our five-year outlook. While some of American Water's peers have had difficulty closing municipal water acquisitions, American Water continues to execute on identifying and closing acquisitions. The company expects 2% annual customer additions, consistent with previous expectations. The company has over $611 million of acquisitions under agreement. The pipeline for future acquisitions remains very healthy with 1.3 million potential customer connections.","The company operates in constructive regulatory environments that support recovery of prudent costs and support growth investments.  American Water Works' size should be an advantage in pursuing new customers and acquisitions in the coming years. Tuck-ins to existing systems are a cheap source of growth. Much of America's water infrastructure is old and will require significant investment over the coming decades, allowing the company to increase its rate base and earnings for many years to come.","American Water Works' sizable plans for infrastructure replacement and upgrades could run into some pushback from rising rates for water that has traditionally been cheap. Conservation is biting into weather-adjusted usage across the company's territories, requiring higher rates to maintain returns. Acquisitions of regulated utilities can be difficult and time-consuming and sometimes end in failure.",07/08/2023,"American Water Works has consistently increased earnings more than most regulated electric utilities even though core retail water use has steadily fallen as a result of efficiency savings.  American Water Works is replacing and upgrading infrastructure that is decades old across its system, resulting in significant organic growth. We also expect the company to grow by acquiring small, typically municipal-owned water systems. In the U.S., more than 80% of the population is served by a municipal water utility, offering a long runway of acquisition growth opportunities. Earnings growth has been supported by constructive regulatory frameworks and improving operations and maintenance efficiency. Fair market value laws in several states support American Water Works' acquisition strategy. These laws require the company to pay municipalities at least the assessed value of the system it acquires and allow American Water Works to add these assets to rate base at the assessed value rather than historical cost. The municipalities benefit by ensuring they get fair prices, and American Water Works shareholders benefit by ensuring the company doesn't overpay for growth. In many cases, these deals are immediately value-accretive. The pipeline for future acquisitions remains very healthy, with a potential 1.3 million new customer connections as of late July. The company's regulatory strategy is to work proactively with regulators to ensure timely recovery of rising costs and gain support of continued investments. This has helped the company mitigate the headwinds of rising operating and interest costs. Management consistently delivers on a busy regulatory calendar, resulting in constructive outcomes. After divesting its homeowner services group, the company's only remaining nonregulated business is the small military service group, which produces regulated-like earnings based on long-term government contracts that are longer than 30 years. The company has a long runway of additional contract opportunities.","We assign American Water Works a narrow moat rating. Water utility regulation in the U.S. recognizes the need for capital providers--lenders and shareholders--to earn a return on their investments while ensuring that utilities do not take advantage of their service area monopolies by gouging customers. We have confidence that American Water Works' returns on invested capital will remain at a healthy spread over its cost of capital for the foreseeable future. American Water Works owns a difficult-to-replicate network of water utilities that meet essential needs for customers. In exchange for a service territory monopoly, state and federal regulators set rates for American Water Works' water utilities at levels that aim to keep customer costs low while providing adequate returns for capital providers. This implicit contract between regulators and the utilities should, in the long run, allow American Water Works to earn a consistent spread over its cost of capital. Rate-setting mechanisms in the states that American Water Works serves are mostly constructive, leading to ROICs modestly above its weighted average cost of capital.American Water Works enjoys fair market value legislation in many of the states where it operates. This allows the company to ensure that its growth acquisitions are value-accretive by allowing it to adjust its regulated earning asset base to reflect the deal value based on a third-party valuation. This effectively eliminates the drag on returns created by goodwill and the risk of cost overruns for organic growth investment. The diversity of American Water Works' regional footprint means that weaker returns experienced in the short term at any one subsidiary will have only a minor impact on consolidated returns. After divesting the homeowner services group, the remaining nonregulated business is the company's military service group, which produces regulated-like earnings with long-term government contracts. We think the unit supports American Water Works' narrow moat.As with all regulated utilities, we think regulatory caps on revenue and returns preclude American Water Works from establishing a wide economic moat.","We give American Water Works a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.American Water Works derives most of its profits from regulated operations subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions and other regulatory agencies. This regulation sets the rates that American Water Works can charge customers. Consequently, the greatest risk it faces is regulation that does not allow the company to recover operating expenses and a return on invested capital.American Water Works' large capital investment plan will require management execution to keep projects on time and on budget. This could prove challenging given current inflationary headwinds. Delays or cost overruns could reduce shareholder returns.American Water Works faces environmental, social, and governance risk due in large part to the importance of water quality. The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and human-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. Sometimes state regulations may be more stringent than federal standards.American Water Works provides regulated wastewater services to communities and military bases. Wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal operations are also subject to substantial regulations and subject to ESG risks similar to water treatment.","We assign American Water Works a Standard capital allocation rating based on our assessment of the company's balance sheet strength, management's investment decisions, and plans to return capital to shareholders.We think the company's dividend payout of 55%-60% of earnings is appropriate, given the high quality and stable nature of the company's regulated assets. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound and in line with regulatory requirements, supported by low revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. We expect the company's investment strategy to focus on expanding assets through regulated investments, which we think is a reasonable approach.Most of the future capital spending is for regulated operations, where returns are mostly predictable and operating costs are low. Management has made nonregulated investments that have not earned positive economic returns, but it was quick to act and divest these businesses.Most of American Water Works' operations are regulated, but management is very focused on cost control. One metric used by the company is the operations and maintenance efficiency ratio, a measure of adjusted O&M expenses divided by adjusted revenue. This ratio has dropped to 34.1%, an impressive improvement from over 46% in 2010. Management's target for 2027 is 30% or below, which we view as achievable given management's cost track record. However, this will be more difficult in the current inflationary environment.Susan Hardwick took over as CEO in early 2022. We think Hardwick has been a good steward for shareholders. She previously served as executive vice president and chief financial officer and has extensive prior utility experience.John Griffith became executive vice president and chief financial officer in 2022, taking over from Hardwick. Griffith has significant investment banking experience in both regulated utilities and renewable energy, and we think he is a strong hire.","American Water Works is the largest investor-owned U.S. water and wastewater utility, serving approximately 3.5 million customers in 16 states. It provides water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and operates predominantly in regulated markets. The company's nonregulated business is water services for military bases, which operates under long-term contracts with regulated-like returns.","American Water Works' financial health is sound for a regulated water utility, particularly in light of its stable, low-risk business model. American Water Works' debt/capital ratio was near 60% at year-end 2022. Management has signaled that leverage will stay near this level with planned capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividend growth.With our expectations for the company to spend $15 billion in capital through 2027, the company will be a frequent debt issuer. The company has manageable long-term debt maturities and we anticipate it will be able to refinance its debt as it comes due. We expect the company to issue $2 billion in equity for its capital investment plan, including the $1.7 billion already executed in 2023 and the remaining over our five-year forecast.We expect debt/EBITDA to remain above 5 times, a level modestly higher than that of other regulated utilities.

24/11/2023,Goldman Sachs Is Refocusing Its Business Model and Arguably Giving Up Some Upside Optionality,The Goldman Sachs Group Inc,GS,4,20/11/2023,Michael Wong,338.64,USD,23/11/2023,368.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,D,20/11/2023,"With interest rates at or near their peak and the increasingly popular view that the United States will avoid a recession, investment banking revenue is poised to rebound from recent lows. However, given the record levels of investment banking and trading revenue that U.S.-based banks booked in 2020 and 2021, there's an open question with regard to the reasonable level that investment banking revenue recovers to. While we don't believe that investment banking revenue will reach 2020-21 heights in the foreseeable future, we do believe that U.S.-based investment banks should have consistently higher revenue than they had before the COVID-19 pandemic due to the pullback of Europe-based banks. We estimate that Europe-based banks lost 12 percentage points of revenue market share in investment banking and 15 percentage points in trading from 2012 through 2022. We also believe that much of this loss in market share is permanent, as these banks have chosen to reduce their investment banking activities after years of volatile and often low returns. At recent prices, we believe Morgan Stanley's shares offer a better risk/reward ratio than Goldman Sachs'.","More stable investment management and net interest income could cause investors to reassess Goldman's earnings quality and increase their willingness to pay a premium for it. The company's trading operations can potentially do well in recessions and periods of economic uncertainty, which can buffer earnings. Several of the company's primary U.S. and European competitors have been forced to restructure, which could give Goldman an opportunity to gain market share.","While Goldman is in a better capital position than it was and has a shifting business mix, it may take a while for the market to give the company full credit for the changes. The company's strategy has also been somewhat muddied by recent acquisitions and divestitures. 2020 and 2021 were unusually strong years for investment banks like Goldman Sachs. Revenue growth and earnings in the following years could prove disappointing. Lower leverage than in the past reduces returns to shareholders. Newly proposed banking regulations could further decrease leverage at banks.",04/10/2023,"Goldman Sachs is refocusing the initiatives its been working on the previous several years. At its 2023 investor day, it emphasized three priorities. In its investment banking and trading business, it wants to maximize client wallet share and grow its financing business. In asset and wealth management, it wants to grow its management fees, including in wealth management and raising third-party capital for its alternatives business. In its new platforms business, it wants to scale and achieve profitability. Goldman Sachs had been building businesses for noninstitutional clients but has drastically pared down its ambitions. It has found or is finding new homes for acquisitions it had done in wealth management and installment lending to more main street customers. While we didnt view these acquisitions as needle movers for profitability, they were steps toward diversifying the business and fit in with trends that the market had rewarded at peers. The acquisitions, divestitures, and decreased profitability from newer initiatives muddied the companys investment narrative and financial statements. With Goldman refocusing, it will revert to mainly being valued as a relatively volatile investment bank. Goldman Sachs financial targets are for a through-the-cycle return on equity of 14% to 16%, return on tangible common equity of 15% to 17%, and an expense ratio of about 60%. We currently forecast the company missing its targets and model the company achieving a return on tangible common equity of about 12.5%. Given our outlook, we think the firm should trade at about 1.3 times tangible book value. Until the question of a U.S. or global recession is resolved, we believe results will be lackluster. Economic uncertainty reduces asset valuations that weigh on asset and wealth management fees. Uncertainty also makes companies cautious of going public or pursuing large acquisitions. A recession would also push the companys consumer business further into the red, as credit costs increase. Trading revenue may benefit from market volatility, but it's also the revenue line that is most elevated from precoronavirus levels and could stall or fall over the next couple of years.","Investment banking moats are primarily built upon intangibles. Intangibles for an investment bank are in the strength of its reputation and relationships. For capital raising, merger advisory, and restructuring advisory, companies work with investment banks that have a history of successful pricing and execution of deals in their industry and with bankers with whom they have a trusted relationship. A benchmark of investment banking reputation is high placement in investment banking league tables.We assess Goldman Sachs as having a narrow Morningstar Economic Moat Rating. The Goldman Sachs name has brand recognition that provides a competitive advantage for garnering investment banking deals and recruiting top talent. Its global reach and scale also give it the ability to vie for large cross-border deals that smaller brokerages can't handle. The company frequently ranks in the top three investment banks for global equity underwriting and for mergers and acquisitions advisory. Goldman Sachs also ranks in the top 10 investment banks for fixed-income underwriting.The company's high-return-on-capital asset-management business has the moat characteristics of the stronger asset managers, as it is well diversified by asset type and distribution channel. Of the company's $2.5 trillion of assets under supervision at the end of 2022, approximately 10% are in alternative investments, 20% in equities, 40% in fixed income, and 30% in liquidity products. By distribution channel, assets are nearly evenly split among high-net-worth individuals, third-party distributed, and institutional clients.While brokerage and principal investing are competitive businesses, Goldman Sachs is arguably the best in the business, with a history of strong growth and returns partially attributable to its informational advantages, technology infrastructure, and risk management. The company consistently generates annual trading revenue of $10 billion to over $20 billion in some years, which makes it one of the largest broker/dealers in the world. Even though Goldman Sachs is first-class in its industry, it's an industry with a history of fallen stars. We believe assigning the company a wide moat rating, with its connotation of stability, is currently unwarranted.","The largest risk for Goldman Sachs is that it may have been too slow to adapt to the current regulatory and capital markets environment. Other banks were quicker to materially change their operations, such as by increasing the emphasis on their wealth management operations and de-emphasizing their trading operations. While Goldman Sachs did pare back its trading operations and has recently been speaking more about its investment management business and digital banking, these changes came later than peers, and it will take a while for them to scale. We generally believe that Goldman Sachs' recent strategic plans are reasonable. However, the uncertain economic environment that started in 2022 could push back the attainment or force revisions in financial goals. Investors can also be less forgiving of investing for growth or incurring expenses for strategic shifts when core earnings are under pressure.Goldman Sachs has moderate exposure to environmental, social, and governance risks. The largest social issue for Goldman Sachs and many other investment banks is their ability to attract and retain high-quality talent. Additionally, many investment banks are notorious for their long work hours. This is factored into our model in a relatively high compensation ratio. Investment banks and wealth management firms can often have product governance issues stemming from their sales and trading operations of selling products that aren't suitable to their clients and profiting at their clients' expense. Regulatory fines and litigation expenses are a normal part of business that we generally incorporate into our valuation model.Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Goldman Sachs is Medium. U.S. banking regulations have become much stricter since the 2008 great recession, which means banks have much more capital and liquidity to weather recessions.","We give Goldman Sachs a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. At the end of 2022, the company had a standardized common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 15%. This ratio is calculated based on risk-weighted assets, so is a reasonable measure of capital adequacy for comparison with peers. Goldman's 15% is on the higher end for banks and about in line with the company's own internal target. Management aims to keep a 50- to 100-basis-point buffer above its regulatory capital requirements. The companys capital investment decisions are fair, with Goldman Sachs predominately growing through internal investment rather than acquisitions, as illustrated by the company only having less than $10 billion of goodwill and intangibles compared with a $1 trillion-plus balance sheet. Some recent business expansions and acquisitions involving consumer credit and wealth management were arguably ill-timed or poorly executed but were not signifcant to the company's overall valuation. We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. Goldman Sachs has historically returned more capital through share repurchases than dividends, which makes sense for a company whose earnings can be volatile.David Solomon was appointed CEO in 2018. He has been chief operating officer and co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs. Since becoming CEO, Solomon has made some changes in the management team, such as appointing a new chief financial officer and chief operating officer. He's also put more of an emphasis on more steady and less capital-intensive businesses, such as asset management and consumer banking.Historically, Goldman Sachs has earned materially more than its cost of capital and its peer group. Expansion of its core operations and disciplined investing of its own capital led to this outperformance. We believe management handled Goldman as well as its peers through the financial crisis and is taking prudent steps in preparation for the new regulatory environment.Multiple parts of the company's recent strategic plans were sound, and other portions may or may not pan out. Overall, we believe the company should be successful in its funding and operating cost-saving plan. Goldman Sachs should have some success expanding its core businesses, such as offering investment banking services to more small and medium businesses and expanding its institutional asset-management business, but it has a greater risk of falling short of its goals over the next several years given the tough economic environment.","Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking and asset management firm. Approximately 20% of its revenue comes from investment banking, 45% from trading, 20% from asset management and 15% from wealth management and retail financial services. Around 60% of the company's net revenue is generated in the Americas, 15% in Asia, and 25% in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.","We expect long-run gross leverage of 11-13 times. This is below pre-credit-crisis levels of above 25 times. Although Goldman remains highly leveraged, it has restructured as a bank holding company, and its access to government borrowing facilities decreases its short-term funding concerns. The balance sheet is also much cleaner now than before the recession and has a high amount of excess liquid securities. Recently, level 3 assets that are valued using inputs that are significant and unobservable were less than 25% of common equity compared with over 100% in 2008. Although we don't have any immediate concerns in terms of solvency or liquidity, an investment bank's financial health can turn rapidly for the worse if counterparties experience a crisis of confidence.Goldman Sachs' regulatory capital ratios are healthy. At the end of 2022, the company had a ""standardized-approach"" 15% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The company targets a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 50 to 100 basis points above its requirements with a 2022 requirement of 13.3%. All of Goldman's capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory minimums. The company's ability to return capital is determined by the Federal Reserve Board's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.",GS,Financial Services,113627201536.0,NYQ,2885362.0,USD,338.6400146484375,True,1,326.12988245346935,378.53148057725923,1
25/11/2023,Johnson Controls Is Poised to Ride Secular Tailwinds for Above-GDP Long-Term Growth,Johnson Controls International PLC,JCI,4,28/09/2023,Brian Bernard,52.4,USD,24/11/2023,72.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,28/09/2023,"After market close on Sept. 27, Johnson Controls issued a Form 8-K filing disclosing that a cybersecurity incident had disrupted the firms internal information technology systems. The stock price declined approximately 2.5% on Sept. 28 in reaction to the news. According to an article published by Bleeping Computer, a ransomware attack originating in Johnson Controls Asia offices spread to broader IT applications. However, Johnson Controls said that much of the firm's IT infrastructure is unaffected. That said, it seems to us that the companys financial reporting systems could be affected because the filing warned that this incident could delay the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. We currently dont believe this incident will materially affect Johnson Controls customers, but mitigating the issue will certainly be an added (and unanticipated) expense, although such costs may be covered by insurance policies. We will maintain our near-term financial projections until we learn more about any fallout from this incident, likely during the firms upcoming fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call. Furthermore, were also maintaining our narrow moat rating and $72 per share fair value estimate. This cybersecurity incident will certainly be a near-term headache for Johnson Controls, but we dont think it will affect our long-term outlook.",Johnson Controls should benefit from secular trends in global urbanization and increased demand for energy-efficient and smart building solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the market opportunity for air filtration and touchless access control solutions. Johnson Controls' growing catalog of digital solutions and efforts to increase service attachment rates should bolster top-line growth and expand operating margin. ,"Economic uncertainty could slow commercial construction and retrofit spending, negatively affecting HVAC, building automation, and fire and security product and installation sales. Buildings is traditionally a late-cycle business. Increased acceptance of work-from-home arrangements could reduce demand for commercial real estate, lowering Johnson Controls' total addressable market. Johnson Controls' profit margins are meaningfully lower than those of Carrier, Trane, and Lennox.",02/08/2023,"Before 2016, the market had viewed Johnson Controls as an automotive-parts company because about two thirds of its sales came from automakers. However, after merging with Tyco and spinning off its automotive seating business, now known as Adient, in late 2016, Johnson Controls has become a more profitable and less cyclical pure-play building technology firm that manufactures HVAC systems, fire and security products, and building automation and control products. In early 2019, Johnson Controls sold its power solutions business to a consortium of investors for $11.6 billion of net proceeds, which it used to pay down debt and repurchase shares. We believe Johnson Controls' prudent capital allocation strategy in tandem with its simplified business model that is clearly showing improving fundamentals has been a catalyst for the stock. As a pure-play building technologies and solutions business, Johnson Controls stands to benefit from secular trends in global urbanization and increased demand for energy-efficient and smart building products and solutions. We also expect the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the market opportunity for healthy building solutions, such as air filtration and touchless access controls. These secular tailwinds should allow Johnson Controls to grow faster than the economies it serves. Indeed, over the next couple of years (through fiscal 2024), the firm is targeting revenue growth at a 6%-7% compound annual rate, compared with expectations of 4%-5% market growth. Key levers behind Johnson Controls' targeted outperformance include continued product innovation (supporting market share gains and pricing), increased service penetration (a higher-margin opportunity), and participation in meaningful growth themes (for example, energy efficiency, smart buildings, and indoor air quality solutions).","We think Johnson Controls benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. As such, we assign it a narrow economic moat rating. Johnson Controls building technologies and solutions business holds a strong position in commercial HVAC equipment, building automation and controls, and fire and security. Our Economic Moat Source Series: Intangible Assets white paper says, ""While many companies claim their reputation and customer relationships are a competitive advantage, we consider this the exception rather than the rule. In complex industries, a good record in offering customers durable, well-engineered, and reliable equipment cannot be achieved without technological know-how."" We believe that Johnson Controls' technological know-how is a key differentiator, especially for large, complex commercial building system projects. Indeed, there are only a handful of competitors than compete in that specific piece of the market.Johnson Controls' installed HVAC, building automation, and fire and security systems are important assets that generate a lucrative stream of recurring revenue over the lifetime of the system. Given the mission-critical nature of commercial HVAC systems, maintenance, service, and aftermarket parts are needed to avoid disruptive and costly system breakdowns. Johnson Controls' installed base of Metasys, the firm's building automation system, generates recurring software upgrade and subscription-based revenue. Metasys software updates improve system functionality and guard against new cybersecurity threats. With the Tyco merger in 2016, Johnson Controls added a large installed base of fire and security systems that generate a significant amount of recurring maintenance and monitoring revenue. During Tyco's final analyst day before the merger (November 2014), the company said approximately 25% of its top line was recurring service revenue.New commercial HVAC, building automation, and fire and security systems are a large investment that can require lengthy installation time. As such, we believe building operators would be reluctant to completely replace entire HVAC, building automation, and fire and security systems and instead prefer to upgrade, retrofit, or reconfigure existing systems to adapt to changing technology, regulatory standards, and user requirements. This is a favorable dynamic for Johnson Controls, which is well positioned to capture upgrade, retrofit, and reconfiguration spending from its installed base.In terms of service revenue, Johnson Controls' ability to capture future HVAC maintenance and service revenue from its installed base is not always guaranteed. Third-party service companies and competing manufacturers are generally able to service many of Johnson Controls' products, and some customers have internal engineers that can service systems to a certain extent. A competing manufacturer that wins a service contract on a Johnson Controls system can slowly replace components of that system with its own equipment over time. However, there are only a handful of companies that can challenge Johnson Controls' commercial HVAC position, including Carrier, Trane Technologies, Daikin, and to a lesser extent Lennox (which only competes in light commercial applications). Of course, Johnson Controls has the same opportunity to win service contracts on competing HVAC systems as well.We don't believe that Johnson Controls' switching cost advantage extends to the residential HVAC market because residential replacement costs are comparatively low, and the service market is far more fragmented and competitive. However, residential HVAC sales account for less than 10% of Johnson Controls' consolidated revenue.With regard to Johnson Controls' fire and security monitoring services, we believe in many cases it's more cost-effective for a customer to outsource these monitoring services to Johnson Controls rather than use an in-house monitoring staff.Few of Johnson Controls' competitors offer such a comprehensive suite of commercial building systems and related services. As such, there are few alternatives for building operators that value Johnson Controls' one-stop-shop approach and prefer to use one firm's equipment and services for its key building systems.Service is an important source of revenue and profitability for Johnson Controls' buildings business. The company uses an extensive branch network to provide installation and services for its customers around the globe. While myriad HVAC and fire and security service providers exist, few have the revenue base to support a similar-size branch network. As such, Johnson Controls is much better positioned to directly service customers that have multiple locations across the U.S. and the world compared with local and regional competitors that don't have the scale to profitably service customers with national or multinational footprints. Furthermore, we believe Johnson Controls' branch density results in better service quality. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Johnson Controls is Medium. We view general economic uncertainty and competition as the key sources of valuation uncertainty for the company. Johnson Controls' financial performance is dependent upon commercial construction and retrofit and replacement activity, and to a much lesser extent, residential construction and repair and remodel spending. These markets are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, which can change drastically over a business cycle and are often challenging to predict. Additionally, regulatory changes and technological advances can affect customer buying patterns. Nevertheless, we think Johnson Controls' growing service revenue mix tempers the firm's cyclicality. Service revenue accounts for approximately 25% of Johnson Controls' consolidated revenue and about 60% of that is recurring revenue. We believe service revenue can grow at a mid- to high-single-digit annual pace over the next five years as the company expands its digital services offering and increases service attachment rates. Johnson Controls competes with well-established and capable competitors (for example, Carrier and Trane Technologies), and it must stay on the cutting edge of product innovation and quality to meet future environmental and energy efficiency standards and maintain its position as a premium brand. Falling behind its competition could impair its pricing power and market share.","We assign Johnson Controls a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, satisfactory investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions.We think Johnson Controls has a sound balance sheet. The firm operates with a reasonable amount of leverage (2.1 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA as of the fiscal third quarter) with plenty of liquidity (roughly $1.1 billion cash balance and $3 billion undrawn on credit facilities). We assess Johnson Controls' investment strategy as satisfactory. Given the size of the 2016 Tyco merger, we do not expect any similar-size acquisitions anytime soon; however, we expect the company will continue to actively manage its business portfolio with smaller-scale acquisitions and divestitures, probably focusing on building management solutions. Management's recent organic growth strategy has been successful, in our view, and we think future organic growth investments (for example, its OpenBlue platform) will support Johnson Controls' competitive positioning.We believe Johnson Controls' shareholder distribution policy is appropriate. We expect the company will continue returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Former Tyco CEO and Johnson Controls COO George Oliver succeeded Alex Molinaroli as chair and CEO in 2017. In our view, Oliver is a strong operator willing to roll up his sleeves to build a stronger company and create shareholder value. As such, we think Johnson Controls is in capable hands. Before the merger, Oliver had been Tycos CEO since the company became a stand-alone fire and security business in 2012. During his tenure at Tyco, Oliver ran a balanced capital-allocation strategy, oversaw numerous acquisitions and divestitures, and implemented organization-wide operational improvement initiatives, which resulted in improved profitability. Before joining Tyco in 2006, Oliver spent over 20 years at General Electric.Olivier Leonetti replaced retired CFO Brian Stief, who helped Johnson Controls transform into a pure-play building technologies firm with improved fundamentals and a strong balance sheet. We think Leonetti's experience with digital technologies could benefit the company's smart building initiatives. ","Johnson Controls manufactures, installs, and services HVAC systems, building management systems and controls, industrial refrigeration systems, and fire and security solutions. Commercial HVAC accounts for about 40% of sales, fire and security represents 40% of sales, and residential HVAC, industrial refrigeration, and other solutions account for the remaining 20% of revenue. In fiscal 2022, Johnson Controls generated over $25 billion in revenue.","After selling its power solutions segment in April 2019, which netted Johnson Controls $11.6 billion, the firm paid down $5.3 billion of debt and repurchased 191 million shares (21% share reduction) for approximately $7.5 billion. The balance sheet is now in great shape, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of about 2.1, within management's targeted range of 2.0-2.5. The firm finished its fiscal third quarter with roughly $9.8 billion of debt, about $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and $3 billion available on two credit facilities. We see this significant liquidity as dry powder for additional buybacks or acquisitions.",JCI,Industrials,36662444032.0,NYQ,4441834.0,USD,52.400001525878906,True,1,55.48141174316118,56.85439016760853,1
24/11/2023,Strong Assets Give Warner Brothers Discovery an Edge Amid Challenges of a Changing Media Landscape,Warner Bros. Discovery Inc,WBD,5,08/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,10.66,USD,23/11/2023,25.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,C,08/11/2023,"Warner Brothers Discovery continues to make significant progress in reducing costs, increasing cash flow, and paying down debt. However, third-quarter results show that it has not yet hit its stride with its evolving direct-to-consumer, or DTC, business, and a weak advertising environment weighed on networks revenue, which is still the firms biggest segment. Considering its evolving DTC offering and the potential effect of the actors strike, we are not reading too much into the quarters weaknesses, and we are maintaining our $25 fair value estimate. Warner lost a net 700,000 DTC subscribers during the quarter, including a loss of 1.4 million in the U.S. We dont judge this seeming weakness too harshly, as the firm is still contending with overlapping subscriber bases after combining Discovery+ and HBO Max. The Max DTC offering is still evolving, and the third quarter featured a weak slate of new content, as shows were pushed back due to the strike. We suggest investors reserve judgment on how successful Max can be. Softness in linear TV advertising was the biggest headwind to Warners top line, and management was not willing to predict improvement in 2024. The 12% year-over-year drop in networks advertising revenue was exacerbated by the absence of midterm elections, and we expect the presidential election will help offset any general softness in 2024. However, we expect both advertising and distribution revenue in Warners networks business to trend lower over the next several years as pay-tv subscriptions continue to decline. Total third-quarter networks revenue was down 6.6% versus last year. Cost efficiencies and the strike disruption helped lift the EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points year over year to nearly 30%. As a result, free cash flow in the quarter was $2 billion, and management expects net debt/EBITDA to be below 4.0 by year-end. With a stronger financial footing, we expect the firm to direct more cash toward growth investment.","Warner Bros. Discovery owns one of the best rosters of production studios for both scripted and unscripted content.  The firm owns the rights to the majority of original programming broadcast on its channels, especially unscripted content, creating a large library that can generate multiple revenue streams.  Max has a long runway for growth available in both the U.S. and internationally. The firms original series and the deep and constantly expanding library would drive the growth.","The streaming space is crowded. Warner Bros. Discovery may need to fund losses for many years to build a sizable customer base.  International expansion exposes the company to multiple country-specific risks and regulatory regimes that may be more challenging than in the U.S.  The business model for the cable network depends on the continued growth of affiliate fees. Any slowdown in the growth of these fees, as pay-TV subscribers continue to decline, could tremendously hit profitability.",09/10/2023,"Warner Bros. Discovery, the result of combining Discovery Communications and WarnerMedia, is one of the largest media firms in the world with tremendous scale and reach. We project that the company, led by former Discovery CEO David Zaslav, will use its combined content library and production capabilities to drive further growth in its streaming services as it navigates the transition toward a more direct-to-consumer focused model, centered on a combined HBO Max/Discovery+ service named Max.  Warner remains one of the largest traditional media powerhouses and owns a deep content library, strong TV and film studios, linear cable networks, and a growing streaming service in Max. Beyond the flagship HBO marquee, Warner owns several well-known media brands, including CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Studio, and Bleacher Report. The firm controls major franchises via DC Comics (Superman, Wonder Woman), Adult Swim/Cartoon Network (Rick and Morty), HBO (Game of Thrones), and WB Pictures (Harry Potter).  Discovery produces and owns unique, unscripted content with proven appeal to audiences across cultures and languages. Discovery, TLC, HGTV, Food Network, and Animal Planet are the five flagship networks, with the namesake channel reaching more than 81 million subscribers in the U.S. and 226 million subscribers and viewers internationally. Discoverys streaming service, Discovery+, has gained some early traction since launching in 2021. As it is already profitable, Discovery+ will remain available separately from Max. While Zaslav has not run a more traditional media company like Warner Bros., the longtime Discovery CEO presided over the transition of Discovery from a cable network owner to unscripted content creation powerhouse. We expect that Zaslav will use his experience to help Warner Bros. Discovery transition into a DTC powerhouse by focusing further investment in both content and the user experience, which garnered complaints on both HBO Max and Discovery+. Like its competitors, we expect the combined streaming service will expand internationally to reach the 2025 target of 130 million subscribers. ","We assign Warner Bros. Discovery a narrow moat rating based on intangible assets. The combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications created a massive media firm with tremendous content production and distribution capabilities and a very deep and wide content library. The new company owns several well-known networks including HBO, Discovery, CNN, and TLC, as well as a slew of major entertainment franchises like Superman, Rick and Morty, and Game of Thrones. While we expect Warner Bros. Discovery to merge functions and offerings over the longer term, we believe that the two firms, at least on consumer facing basis, will operate somewhat separately in the near term. Discovery is a vertically integrated content company that owns domestic and international channels and produces most of the nonfiction (or unscripted) programming that airs them. The companys three traditional main networks (Discovery, TLC, and Animal Planet) reach roughly 80 million households subscribing to basic cable in the U.S. with both Discovery and TLC having more than 260 million international subscribers and viewers. The top two networks (HGTV and Food Network), acquired in the Scripps transaction, are available in more than 82 million households in the U.S. Even as the media landscape continues to shift, we believe that Discoverys exposure to international markets and content ownership provides a base to help weather any disruptions. The firm used its unique content to launch Discovery+. While the service has gotten off to a decent start since its launch in January 2021, growth has slowed and we remain worried that the content slate for a standalone service may limit the addressable market.WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. is one of the oldest media firms. The namesake studio was founded in 1918 and incorporated in 1923. Current assets include the Turner Networks (CNN, TBS, and TNT among others), HBO and HBO Studio, Warner Bros. Studio, Cartoon Network, and Bleacher Report. The major franchises under control are some of the biggest in the world, such as DC Comics (Superman, Wonder Woman), Adult Swim/Cartoon Network (Rick and Morty), HBO (Game of Thrones), and WB Pictures (Harry Potter, Matrix). When still owned by AT&T, Warner began the transition to the direct-to-consumer, or DTC, market by consolidating much of its most valuable content onto the HBO Max offering. Despite the strong library, concurrent streaming releases for the firms 2021 movie slate, and the consolidation of traditional HBO subscribers, Max still has a smaller subscriber base than either Netflix or Disney+. Despite changes in consumer behavior, pay-television penetration remains above 60% of U.S. households. The Discovery and Turner networks both remain important pieces in the traditional pay-TV bundle. While cord-cutting remains an ongoing issue, premier cable networks like Discovery and CNN still generate significant cash flows from both affiliate fees and advertising. The firms combined network roster provides distributors with not only general entertainment but also live sports at the Turner channels and news at CNN and Headline, two genres that are keeping many subscribers in the pay-TV universe. Additionally, Discoverys Food Network and HGTV have historically high live viewing rates comparable to other networks, providing additional value to advertisers and helping to retain subscribers. While we expect the pay-TV subscribers to continue to decline annually, the underlying networks remain profitable, and the cash generated will continue to be reallocated to support the direct-to-consumer efforts at Warner Bros. Discovery.Even without a pay-TV subscription, most cord-cutters still desire to consume large quantities of video content. Discovery and Warner Bros. each brought strong studios to the merger with minimal overlap among genres. Warner Bros. Studio is one of the five major film studios and finished as the second-highest in total box office grosses every year from 2016-19. On the television side, the combination of Warner Bros. and HBO made WarnerMedia one of, if not the, strongest creators in scripted programming with success in mass-market (Big Bang Theory, Manifest) and prestige (Succession, Game of Thrones). Despite many of its peers pulling back on licensing or producing content for other firms, Warner Bros. remains a supplier of programming to almost all of its competitors in traditional TV and streaming. Recent examples of hit shows that were developed or co-produced by WB for outside distribution include Ted Lasso (Apple+), Manifest (NBC/Netflix), Queen Sugar (OWN), and Young Sheldon (CBS). While the new management team may reverse course on this practice, WB television content licensing for both in-house and outside consumption represented 18% of total pro forma 2021 revenue and we estimate well over 50% of that came from shows originally placed outside the firm. We expect the WB studios to continue to supply content to the best suited platform while keeping first-right of refusal for new shows and trying to retain steaming rights when possible. We believe that this platform-agnostic model has provided a virtuous cycle for WB Studios as the studio has been willing to find the best place for a new series and not simply shunt onto one of its own outlets. We think that this practice is more likely to help a new series become a hit while also attracting and retaining show creators who are deeply invested personally and financially in the success of their shows. The flood of money into the media landscape has somewhat weakened this cycle, but we believe it still exists. While Warner Bros. produces unscripted shows, including The Bachelor and The Voice, Discovery Studio is considerably more productive in this space. The majority of the content on its domestic and international networks as well as on Discovery+ are produced in house at a relatively low cost as compared with scripted shows. Discovery spent roughly $10.5 billion in total on content over 2019-21, which is less than either Netflix, Disney, or WarnerMedia spent in calendar 2021 alone. Even with its lower spending, Discovery owns a number of franchises, including Deadliest Catch (Discovery), Chopped (Food), House Hunters (HGTV), and 90-Day Fiance (TLC). While we have been skeptical about the library value of the Discovery content, the recent demand for Discovery+ shows that there are fans of the programming that are looking to watch older shows. While other streaming services are creating their own unscripted content, we dont believe that anyone else comes close to generating the number of hours or breadth of shows that Discovery does. We also think that competitors will continue to allocate time and marginal money to scripted shows, leaving Discovery in a relatively less competitive space. Since the production strengths of the two predecessor firms only overlap slightly, the merger of the content libraries and studios should help Warner Bros. Discoverys DTC efforts. The firm launched a combined offering of the two libraries under the Max brand in the U.S. in May 2023 with an international rollout planned over the next two years. We believe that the combined offering will be highly appealing to a number of consumers, especially if management holds the price below the pricing umbrella that Netflix has created in the U.S. and other developed markets. The scripted programming from WB, particularly the tentpole movies and prestige shows, would entice subscribers to join the combined offering. The deep scripted and unscripted content library and new shows should help to retain subscribers. ","On the basis of competitive linear and streaming media markets that Warner Bros. Discovery operates in, along with the level of advertising that is exposed to the economy and economic cycles, we believe a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is appropriate to reflect the volatility we expect the firm's investors will face relative to our global coverage.The new business models proliferating throughout the media sector could diminish Warner Bros. Discoverys revenue growth or profitability. Viewership of its programs could fall below expectations and advertisers could pull back on spending, both which could drag on advertising sales growth. The cost of sports rights may continue to skyrocket, putting pressure on margins. Reality or nonfiction TV may fall out of favor, causing the Discovery segments growth to suffer. International tastes may change to no longer appreciate the firms American-produced content, forcing the company to source more programming locally and thus hurting margins. The intense competition in direct-to-consumer streaming may force the company to continually increase content spending while keeping the price to consumers low, thus suppressing margins over the long term.The firm took a considerable amount of debt to fund the merger. While management is trying to pay down debt ahead of schedule, a change in operating performance or in the macro environment could force the firm to slow down payments or reallocate funds for driving business growth to debt repayments.Labor relations are an ESG risk for any media firm. Media firms have been subject to a number of lawsuits alleging racial and gender discrimination, sexual assault/harassment, and wage gap/discrimination. While any single suit may not carry a large potential financial impact, a litany of these reports may, more importantly, affect the firms ability to attract and retain talent in the increasingly competitive fields in which it operates.","We assign Warner Bros. Discovery a Standard capital allocation rating. Our rating is driven primarily by the likelihood that Discovery adds value through investments but also takes into account the shape of its balance sheet and its shareholder distributions. Long-term debt at Warner Bros. Discovery was $44.3 billion as of June 2023, largely as a result of funding the merger. Management expects to lower net debt from around 5 times EBITDA at the end of 2022 to under 4 times by the end of 2023 and 2.5 times by the end of 2024. The firm will operate within 2.5-3.0 times thereafter. In 2022, the combined firm generated $3.3 billion in free cash and spent $7 billion repaying debt. We believe this capital allocation priority is smart. Warner Bros. Discovery operates in a highly competitive landscape in which many of its peers are similarly transitioning to a direct-to-consumer focus. We expect the firm to continue to invest in original programming as Max and Discovery+ expand across the globe. We think this use of capital will likely generate the highest returns for the company over the long run, building on the strong content franchises and distribution capabilities the firm already has.The management team has posted a strong track record with past acquisitions. The Scripps deal has worked out better than expected, and Discovery has a long history of accretive international purchases. But the Warner Bros. merger is a much larger deal than any previous one so integration may be more challenging. We remain slightly concerned that media mergers and acquisitions have been hot over the past few years, driving up prices and increasing the chance that Discovery may have overpaid to close the merger.","Warner Bros. Discovery, the result of combining two large media firms, is one of the largest media firms in the world with tremendous scale and reach. The new company owns some of the biggest global networks including HBO, Discovery, CNN, and TLC and well-known franchises like Superman, Rick and Morty, and Game of Thrones. The firms content production studios include Warner Bros., HBO, Discovery Studios, DC Films, and Cartoon Network Studios. The company operates two major streaming services, Max and Discovery+.","Net debt at Warner Bros. Discovery was $44.3 billion as of June 2023, largely as a result of funding the merger. At the time of the Scripps acquisition in 2018, Discovery management announced that it was suspending the share buyback program in favor of quickly decreasing leverage. The management team appears to have a similar focus now and plans to lower net debt from around 5.0 times EBITDA at the end of 2022 to under 4 times by the end of 2023 and 2.5 times by the end of 2024. As of June 2023, the firm has already repaid $8 billion in debt since the deal closed. The average duration of the outstanding debt is 14.2 years with average cost of debt at 4.6%. The firm expects to operate at a leverage ratio of 2.5-3.0 times over the long run.Discovery had never paid dividends and we dont expect Warner Bros. Discovery will either. Instead, we expect that the firm will resume stock repurchases after lowering its debt load. We also do not foresee any further transformative mergers or acquisitions in the near term as management will be focused on integrating the two firms.",WBD,Communication Services,27628998656.0,NMS,32077857.0,USD,10.65999984741211,True,1,11.48764702292353,10.241851818413581,0
24/11/2023,Mitsubishi Electric's Factory Automation Systems Business to Drive Long-Term Revenue Growth ,Mitsubishi Electric Corp,6503,3,06/11/2023,Jason Kondo,2105.0,JPY,24/11/2023,2200.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,06/11/2023,"The main highlight of Mitsubishi Electrics, or MECs, September-quarter results was the automotive segments turn to profitability, which had been struggling with losses since 2020. In April, the company announced structural reforms, which include discontinuing its car multimedia business and focusing its resources on electrification and advanced driver-assistance systems technologies. We were previously skeptical that the business would return to profitability in this fiscal year, as the company had guided. However, we are encouraged that the business posted an operating margin of 2.0% in the September quarter, an improvement from a loss of 3.3% in the June quarter, turning profitable earlier than we had expected. In addition, the announcement of the spinoff of its automotive business enables the company to accelerate business decisions, demonstrating solid progress in its restructuring. With a revised outlook, we raise our automotive segments operating margin forecasts for fiscal 2023 (ending March 2024) and 2024 to 1.0% and 2.5% from negative 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively, and lift our fair value estimate to JPY 2,200 from JPY 2,000, assuming a company operating margin of 5.7% and 7.0% for these two years. We expect MECs revenue to remain flat in fiscal 2023 as solid growth in automotive equipment/air conditioner sales is offset by weak factory automation sales, but we forecast top-line growth of 4.3% in fiscal 2024 driven by a recovery in FA demand. Despite the positive postearnings share price reaction, we continue to believe that MECs shares are undervalued as the medium-term growth potential of its FA systems is underestimated due to near-term headwinds.",The FA systems business is well positioned for growth as EV/battery and digital (semiconductor/5G) investments continue over the medium term. The recent capacity expansion of power semiconductors will allow Mitsubishi to better capitalize on related demand. Balanced business mix between industrial automation and heavy electrical equipment allows the company to manage risks from downcycles and achieve relatively stable ROIC levels.,"Investors may demand that the company sell businesses with less growth potential and lower margins to improve overall ROIC levels. Corporate governance reforms are necessary to improve ESG risks and win back the trust of shareholders/investors after a series of scandals. The automobile equipment businesses continue to be unprofitable, and the ability to capitalize on the vehicle electrification trend remains uncertain.",06/11/2023,"Mitsubishi Electric utilizes its technology related to the control of electricity to cover a broad spectrum of business fields, including factory automation, or FA, elevators/escalators, social infrastructure equipment, satellite and communication equipment, and air conditioners. The company has the leading domestic share and/or top 5 global share in various products, including program logic controllers, or PLCs, for factory automation, electric systems equipment for trains, elevators/escalators, turbine generators, and power semiconductors. Its key growth driversFA systems, automobile equipment, and air conditioning systems/home appliancestogether make up about 60% of revenue in fiscal 2022.  We expect FA systems to be the main driver of revenue growth over the next five years, as aging populations and increasing labor costs in key Asian markets, as well as increased awareness of risks related to supply chain continuity and safety due to the coronavirus pandemic, will stimulate overall demand for automation. As trends related to Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things continue to gain prominence, we think Mitsubishi's long-term record and reputation for strong technology with its FA systems will position the company for further divisional growth. Equipment in these fields will continue to be required to connect to networks/databases in their respective facilities/vehicles, and high-quality technology is crucial to avoid downtime costs. Further, its technology with its power semiconductors will serve as key components for its products, as they are supplied to both external clients and internal businesses across the company (including but not limited to FA equipment, heavy electrical equipment, and air conditioning).","We assign Mitsubishi Electric a narrow moat rating, due to its intangible assets, which include technology, track record, reputation, as well as high switching costs from mainly the companys factory automation systems, building systems (elevators and escalators) and infrastructure businesses, which together make up above half of total operating income. Intangible Assets: Factory Automation SystemsWe think the factory automation business possesses the strongest economic moat of Mitsubishi Electric's businesses. The FA systems segment includes factory automation equipment, including program logic controllers (the company calls them sequencers), computer numerical controls, or CNCs, AC servo motors, inverters, industrial robots, and electrical discharge machining. We expect existing and potential customers will continue to have a strong preference over equipment from vendors with a strong reputation backed by a proven track record of integrating/implementing factory automation solutions to customer facilities, as customers will attempt to minimize any form of risks on avoiding unplanned downtime. The companys strong intangible assets have allowed the company to realize the third-largest global market share with its PLCs (after wide-moat Rockwell and narrow-moat Siemens) and the leading domestic market share with PLCs (competes with wide-moat Omron), where we estimate its PLC market share to be about 15% globally and 50% in Japan. Further, the company is also an incumbent player with its high-end AC servo motors and CNCs, where it respectively competes globally with market leaders wide-moat Yaskawa Electric and wide-moat Fanuc. As the name implies, the PLC is often described as a mini-industrial controller/computer that can communicate with different equipment, machines, and systems, where a sequence of instructions (logic) is programmed into the PLC and typically takes an extremely short time span of tens of milliseconds for the processor to evaluate all the instructions to produce an output/command. Further, in order to operate a PLC in real time, users depend on an interface, ranging from a simple touch screen or buttons/levers to a more complicated human machine interface with monitoring software installed on a personal computer (also known as supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, systems), to review and input information on the PLC, which then communicates with other external devices as well as factory automation systems. Both PLCs as well as output-related equipment such as AC servo motors and industrial robots are integrated into customers processes and therefore, requires a high degree of knowledge as well as expertise when it comes to providing tailored solutions to the customers needs. These solutions involve a variety of components, including controllers, sensors, microprocessors, power equipment, and motors, all fed into the companys supervisory system, and therefore need to perform in sync among the equipment with a high degree of precision and accuracy, while feeding accurate real-time data to the software in order to add value for the customers. Therefore, leading industrial automation solutions providers such as Mitsubishi Electric must possess strong intangible assets, backed by technologies and track records of providing not only reliable products, but also effective tailored solutions (often planned and co-developed with customers) based on their own product line, to compete globally and maintain its incumbent status. Intangible Assets: Infrastructure SegmentWe rate the companys infrastructure segment a narrow moat backed by mainly intangible assets. The companys other key long-term driver, the segment focuses on equipment tied to mainly social infrastructure demand, particularly in the transportation, defense, and energy spaces in Japan/Asia. We believe Mitsubishi Electrics train systems will be the main contributor to the segments narrow moat. As technologies that provide high levels of safety and software integration play a significant role for social infrastructure systems, companies must possess a long-term track record and reputation for reliability to provide building and transportation solutions on a large scale.A high majority of its train system sales comes from Japan, where it has a proven track record of supplying various electrical equipment, such as railcar traction transformers and converter/inverter systems to the entire operation of the Shinkansen bullet-train network throughout Japan. While the company does not manufacture the rolling stock, it provides much of the electrical equipment used in the trains, the train stations, as well as the power/traction substations, allowing the company to have a leading 60% market share in the rolling stock electrical equipment market in Japan. In fact, its transportation systems revenue exceeds that of all the Japanese rolling stock suppliers with the exception of domestic market leader Hitachis train-related sales. With the exception of Hitachi, many of the rolling stock manufacturers focus on the assembly of the train but have to procure most of the electric-related components. This puts Mitsubishi Electric at an advantage, as rolling stock manufacturers like Kawasaki Heavy Industries would prefer to procure parts from companies like Mitsubishi Electric, rather than from a direct competitor like Hitachi. We believe this also contributes to Mitsubishis intangible assets as the company has accumulated technological knowledge of its customers rolling stock (trains) through co-development and planning. Further, customers prefer to stick to one supplier, when it comes to equipment sets such as motors, brake controls, and integrated management systems, as this allows smoother integration and connectivity, which puts players with wide product lines at an advantage. We expect the companys intangible assets, coupled with high switching costs, to allow it to continue maintaining its incumbent status in the Japanese railway market and generate economic profit for at least the next 10 years.Building Systems Also Supported by Intangible Assets Moat SourceMitsubishi Electrics building systems business, which focus on elevators and escalators, has a strong economic moat on a stand-alone basis, based mainly on intangible assets. It competes as a global incumbent player with wide-moat Otis, wide-moat Kone, wide-moat Schindler, Hitachi, and ThyssenKrupp. The company has consistently displayed its technological capability in the elevator/escalator industry, such as developing the first and only spiral escalator as well as the past worlds fastest or largest elevator at the time of development (though this changes due to competition). While it is difficult to maintain material technology differentiation among the leading players, the incumbents have a significant advantage with their track record and technology capabilities, particularly with large-scale projects due to requirements of speed, size, and in many cases, connectivity. Further, as elevators deal with transporting people every day, safety as well as durability play a crucial role, as any form of accident or unplanned downtime can severely damage the manufacturers credibility and reputation. We expect incumbent players in the elevator/escalator industry, such as Mitsubishi Electric, to maintain their status globally. Further, we expect an increasing income stream from services, which have higher operating margins, as well as its strong track record in Asia, to contribute to its ability to undergo margin expansion as well as generate economic profits over the long term.High Switching Costs Give the Factory Automation Systems Business a Wide Moat on a Stand-Alone BasisWhile we see intangible assets to be Mitsubishi Electrics primary moat source at the company level, we believe switching costs play a significant role in the industrial automation segments economic moat, which partially explains why we expect this segment will be the largest contributor to its long-term economic profit going forward. The companys control-related equipment, which centers on its PLCs, are integrated into its customers complex manufacturing processes and systems, and thus make it extremely difficult to overhaul the equipment without incurring high switching costs from re-integrating systems, training/education, and so on, as well as increasing exposure to risks of unplanned downtime. Further, we think the strength of a factory automation business moat source depends on the degree of switching cost and intangible assets of the individual products relative to other factory automation products, where the role each equipment plays in the overall manufacturing process can especially affect its switching costs. The automation of processes in factories involves a vast set of equipment and components, where the integration of these technologies can be represented with an industrial automation pyramid framework (with five technological levels) to classify and differentiate the key roles within the overall factory automation operation. These technologies are interrelated, as industrial communications and networks connect the products within each level as well as among the different levels. The first level at the bottom of the pyramid (the field level) comprises the physical devices/hardware existing in the production sites, such as actuators (valves, pumps), measuring instruments (switches, flow meters) and sensors. The second level is also known as the control level, where control equipment like the PLCs serve as the brains behind factory floor processes. These devices in the control level receive input from first-level devices like sensors and then create output that controls the production processes, such as moving robots as programmed or maintaining a constant temperature throughout a process. The third, fourth, and fifth levels include the different layers of software, which respectively include the SCADA systems (third level also known as the supervisory level), the management execution systems or MES that monitor the entire production process from raw materials to finished goods (fourth level), and the enterprise resource planning or ERP systems that process information to company decision-makers from every level of the automation pyramid. Within the five levels of the industrial automation pyramid, we see the strongest switching costs in the second level, which include Mitsubishi Electrics PLCs and CNCs, as these products are not only connected to the plants machinery, which requires software integration in the production sites, but also because the hardware and processors running the control loop have long product life (in many cases lasting over 20 years). As a result of the control equipment becoming highly connected within the factory network, high switching costs arise from software integration into the production site, education/training of production staff on equipment usage as well as programming, and risks of unplanned downtime. Further, we think certain output-related products that are directly connected or are often sold with control equipment, such as industrial robots and AC servo motors, also have higher switching costs than their input counterparts. While its input-related automation products, like its sensors, tend to have lower switching costs and intangible assets compared with other automation products (thus partially explaining why these markets on a stand-alone basis are more fragmented), we expect much of these sensors, switches, and/or vision-related equipment will be packaged with its wider-moat products such as its PLCs, servo motors, and robots. As a result of switching costs involved in industrial automation equipment, customers prefer to purchase from companies with intangible assets, which reinforces both moat sources of the industrial automation segment. Narrow Moat vs. Wide MoatWe think Mitsubishi Electric possesses businesses that can be considered as wide moat on a stand-alone basis; however, we assign a narrow moat at the companywide level as we believe the company is not at the level of operating its businesses efficiently compared with its wide-moat peers. While the company tends to be a leading player in all of its segments and the technologies also contribute to the companys intangible assets, we see trends of increasing competition leading to commoditization in some of its businesses such as home appliances and power systems (such as turbines), which will likely suppress the rate of companywide margin expansion going forward. In order to warrant a wide moat, we think the company will have to consider either undergoing restructuring of its business portfolio by selling noncore businesses (which the company has successfully done before) or show signs that its domestic-centered businesses can also undergo overseas expansion over the long term to increase the buffer between the companys return on invested capital and cost of capital. Despite its low margin levels compared with its wide-moat peers, we think there is a case for a narrow moat. Many of the companys products, such as industrial automation, building systems, and social infrastructure equipment, are integrated into a broader infrastructure/system that controls the flow of a certain aspect of the facilities they are part of, thus creating switching costs in the case of changing equipment vendors. In many cases, its customers need to go through co-development and trial production with new equipment manufacturers to ensure safety throughout the product life, and these businesses are supported by high barriers to entry with stringent safety standards, emission regulations, and long-term equipment cycles. We also expect synergies in technology among its businesses, such as being able to apply its technology in its information and communication systems segments satellite business (which the company supplies to Japanese government institutions like Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and has the leading domestic share) to other fields like software for industrial automation control, which contributes to the companys intangible assets. At the company level, Mitsubishi Electrics average adjusted ROIC over the past three years was 7.8%, which was barely above its weighted average cost of capital of 7.6%. We attribute this largely due to its unprofitable automotive equipment business, which have been dragging down its ROIC. However, the company's plan to sell its car multimedia business will support medium-term operating income growth. As such, we expect ROIC to gradually pick up over the medium term and eventually increase to a midcycle ROIC of about 12% in fiscal 2027.Environmental, Social, and Governance RisksWe think Mitsubishi Electric has medium ESG risks at the companywide level. However, we think the risk level related to governance is relatively high and as a result, we see a notable divergence in its management of environmental factors versus governance-related factors, where failure to improve the latter can especially lead to a material impact on future sales. While strong environmental risk management, relative to its peers, has led to the companys inclusion of ESG indexes, such as FTSE4Good and MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders, we think its recent company-specific problemsranging from labor issues due to harsh working conditions in select factories to product governance issuesshow a clear need to better manage its governance/social risks and win back the trust of relevant stakeholders. While company-specific reforms on various issues ranging from labor to information security to quality control need to all be addressed, we think the largest ESG risk to its economic moat comes from how it will manage its governance risks going forward, as poor management can lead to deteriorating intangible assets at the companywide level. The company's arguably largest scandal announced, which subsequently led to the resignation of the CEO, came from its railway systems business, where the company falsified tests on train air conditioning systems and brake systems for a long period. Between at least 1985 and 2020, its factory in Nagasaki, Japan, falsified inspection data by means such as utilizing a computer program to fabricate test results. As a result, the scandal affected about 80 companies or 84,600 train air conditioners, including 15,800 of them in overseas markets like Britain, Germany, and the U.S. Further, there were similar issues with 1,500 compressors for train brakes and doors for railway cars, like Japans Shinkansen bullet trains. While this alone will likely not impact the company's moat, we think poor progress on ESG reforms over the longer term can start to impact the company's intangible assets.We also think the automotive business faces risk as a result of its governance issues. The two main ESG-related issues with the business are: 1) building a track record on developing/supplying electrification and/or advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, technologies, which affect risks related to environmental and social issues regarding safety; and 2) gaining back customer trust from recent quality control problems, which was a result of poor governance. The automotive equipment business, along with its FA business, is part of its industrial automation segment, which is the companys largest segment by operating income. As one of the key businesses of the company, the automotive equipment business makes up more than half of the industrial automation segment sales, but was unprofitable in 2020, making it a factor in the companys adjusted ROIC being barely above its cost of capital for the fiscal year. With CASE-related technologies becoming increasingly influential and eventually going to become part of the norm, Mitsubishi Electric must start developing track records with electrification and ADAS technologies in present time or face deteriorating margins and suppressed ROIC levels in the future, which ultimately affects its moat.As for product governance issues related to the automotive business, in October 2020, the company identified that its automotive radio receivers produced in two of its factories and shipped to customers in the EU were not compliant with certain specifications of the EUs Radio Equipment Directive, or RED. This was discovered from an in-house inspection that had been prompted by a revision in RED technical standards taking effect in December 2020. Further investigations revealed that falsified declarations of compliance were submitted to car manufacturers (customers) before the actual results of the compliance tests were known, and that modified products were used in RED compliance assessment tests, while non-compliant products continued to be shipped out to customers. Mitsubishi Electric confirmed that no similar cases exist in other facilities, and that there are not any problems related to safety with this specific case (mainly a possible noise issue upon receiving AM radio).The immediate financial impact of this product governance problem is not expected to be material (according to company management). However, as the automobile industry goes through a once in a century transformation and companies participating in the automobile electrification/ADAS subsegment must start developing track records now for the sake of long-term survival, these governance issues will add additional hurdles in alleviating concerns regarding quality control and product reliability by customers. We currently assume the companys moat rating will not be impacted by ESG factors, but we will consider a downgrade to its moat rating if we see signs of deteriorating trust by its customers due to poor governance of quality control and that the impact to the automotive business intangible assets moat source materially affects other businesses that have reliance on automobile demand, such as its power semiconductor business.","We rate Mitsubishi Electric's Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as Medium, as its diversified business portfolio and a postpandemic recovery of infrastructure investments would lead to a steady top-line growth over the next five years. Out of the company's business segments, we think the industry and mobility segment, which includes FA systems and automotive equipment, has the highest uncertainty. The segment is highly dependent on capital investment cycles of its customers industries, such as for automobiles, semiconductors, and electronics. While switching costs of FA equipment will likely prevent the majority of existing customers from switching suppliers, we believe there is high uncertainty regarding new customer acquisition, especially in cyclical downturns. Further, these businesses have more overseas exposure than the social infrastructure-related businesses, which give the former higher foreign exchange rate risks (particularly with regard to the yuan and euro) than the latter. Despite the high uncertainty in these businesses, we expect Mitsubishi Electrics balanced business portfolio at the companywide level to limit divergence among our projection scenarios over the next five years.","We rate Mitsubishi Electrics Capital Allocation as Standard. We think the companys balanced capital allocation to its various businesses has allowed it to maintain stability throughout business cycles over the long term, and it was the only Japanese general electric conglomerate that maintained profitability in fiscal 2008 during the financial crisis. Dividends have not changed between 2017 and 2022, at JPY 40 per share (dropped to JPY 36 in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic). Given its ample liquidity, we think there is room for improvement on this end. We were pleased to see the announcement of a share buyback in fiscal 2023, as we thought the shares were undervalued at the time of announcement.While the company has shown strong display of effective allocation of capital in the past, when it sold less profitable businesses such as its LED, ETC system, PC display, and LCD businesses, we think there is room to further restructure its business portfolio to improve shareholder value, considering that its automobile equipment business has been dragging down companywide margins. On the acquisition/investments side, we think its recent acquisitions, including Sharp Fukuyama Semiconductors factory in western Japan as well as U.S.-based Iconics (Internet of Things software company), suppressed ROIC levels but we expect recovery once capacity utilization levels increase, and we believe these investments will strengthen key businesses.Research and development spending at the companywide level has been consistent, averaging about 4% of sales, which is lower than its main competitor in the factory automation space. For example, Omron's industrial automation business' R&D was at about 6% of sales. However, we note Mitsubishi's industrial automation segment revenue is about 1.7 times Omron's industrial automation sales. We think Mitsubishi Electrics high amount of R&D spending would allow the company to remain competitive in product development, as recent developments based on its proprietary AI technology, Maisart, have proved its capabilities.","Mitsubishi Electric is a general electric diversified industrials company that develops, manufactures and sells electrical equipment worldwide. The companys core segments include: industrial automation systems, energy and electric systems, electric devices, information and communication systems, and home appliances (which includes commercial air conditioning). Mitsubishi Electric was founded in 1921 and is headquartered in Tokyo.","We think Mitsubishi Electrics financial health is strong, as it has maintained a net cash position, while being able to self-fund its investing cash outflow with its cash flow from operations, over the past 10 years. Further, during the same period, net debt/EBITDA has remained negative, and we see limited risk related to leverage.We currently do not see any near-term liquidity issues even if the business gets severely affected by headwinds, considering that its current ratio is about 2 times and the ratio of cash to short-term debt is about 3.5 times.",6503.T,Industrials,4301313277952.0,JPX,4975800.0,JPY,2105.0,True,0,1870.1524390243903,2179.9493670886077,1
24/11/2023,W.R. Berkley Is Well Positioned for Current Market Conditions,WR Berkley Corp,WRB,3,13/11/2023,Brett Horn,71.07,USD,23/11/2023,65.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,B,13/11/2023,"P&C insurers have had substantial pricing increases across lines recently, but otherwise, commercial and personal insurers are in very different places. For commercial insurers, an extended period of strong price increases has them in a hard market and realizing attractive underwriting margins. Underlying combined ratios have flattened out recently, and we don't expect any significant improvement. Still, this should leave commercial insurers in a strong position over the next couple of years. Personal auto insurers have endured a difficult period in the wake of the pandemic, due to a variety of negative claims trends, and have been pushing pricing to catch up. While they are not out of trouble yet, we think the third quarter could mark the start of a turn toward more normalized underwriting results. Outside of the cycle, climate-related losses have been an issue in recent years. While the impact of catastrophes in 2023 varied across our coverage, the potential increase in climate-related losses is a meaningful long-term point of uncertainty. However, we are encouraged by recent actions that suggest insurers are approaching this issue with the appropriate amount of discipline. Pricing in lines affected by catastrophes has improved significantly, and insurers have shown a willingness to walk away if pricing is not adequate. On the investment side, insurers that tactically lowered their fixed-income duration are enjoying a relative boost due to higher interest rates, but we believe the time has come to return to matching fixed-income and claims duration, as interest-rate risk is more balanced. We don't see a lot of bargains in the space at the moment, but Travelers is our favorite idea. We think Travelers enjoys a narrow moat but has underperformed a bit in recent years because of a variety of temporary issues. We think the market now underestimates the long-term quality of the business as a result.","A decentralized operating structure allows Berkley to develop expertise in a number of profitable niche fields. Berkley has demonstrated the foresight to enter and exit insurance lines as market opportunities wax and wane. With relatively low exposure to catastrophe risks, Berkley's results are less likely to be impacted by unpredictable weather events or global warming.","The company's reinsurance operations are a drag on overall results. The investment in international opportunities creates a point of uncertainty, and the company's limited disclosure makes it dififcult to track results. During soft pricing periods, Berkley will struggle to earn meaningful excess returns, as it is unwilling to reduce staff.",11/04/2023,"W.R. Berkley's niche focus and strict underwriting discipline result in a business model that has historically earned outstanding returns during hard market pricing periods, but only slightly better than adequate returns during soft periods. In 2020, the pandemic negatively affected both the industry's and W.R. Berkley's results. However, losses in 2020 were very manageable and well within the range of historical events that the industry has successfully absorbed in the past. W.R. Berkley recognized losses roughly in line with peers. However, the industry picture has since brightened significantly. The pricing environment had not been particularly favorable for commercial lines in previous years, and W.R. Berkley had stayed cautious as a result. However, in 2019, pricing momentum picked up in primary lines, and this positive trend only accelerated in 2020. While higher pricing is necessary to some extent to offset some negative claims trends, pricing increases appear to be more than offsetting these factors. As a result, W.R. Berkley and peers are experiencing a positive trend in underlying underwriting profitability, and the company has been getting more aggressive. We see potential for a truly hard pricing market, similar to what the industry saw in 2003. In this scenario, we think narrow-moat and highly disciplined operators such as W.R. Berkley could be positioned to earn very attractive returns for an extended period. Starting in 2003, the company generated returns above 20% for five years. However, given that the industry remains well-capitalized, we think the magnitude and duration of excess returns will be lower than during that period. Still, as a result of these factors, we think W.R. Berkley will generate strong returns in the near term. More importantly, we remain confident that management's approach will favor shareholders in the long run.","In general, property-casualty insurers do not benefit from favorable competitive positions. Industry competition is intense, and the products are essentially commodities. Furthermore, participants do not know their cost of goods sold sometimes for a number of years, causing them to underprice policies without knowing it. Firms have a large incentive to chase growth without regard for profitability, a cycle that repeats itself as competitors are forced to match artificially low prices or risk losing business. However, we believe W.R. Berkley has set itself apart from the industry by focusing on specialty lines, which are subject to less competition than traditional insurance lines, and we believe the company has a Morningstar Economic Moat Rating of Narrow. About 30% of the company's premiums are generated in excess and surplus lines. This, combined with Berkley's focus on long-term value, allows it to write business at favorable prices while maintaining the discipline to decline underpriced policies. This shows in the company's loss ratio, which averaged 62% over the past 10 years, well below the industry average. While this is partially offset by a higher-than-average expense ratio given the need to maintain a staff of experienced underwriters (W.R. Berkley's expense ratio averaged 32% over the past 10 years), the gap in the loss ratio is sufficient to generate significant excess returns over time, in our view. Additionally, we believe the company's expense ratio had been somewhat elevated during much of this period, as W.R. Berkley expanded into new lines and geographies. More recent results indicate the company has now leveraged these investments, which should improve its already impressive underwriting results.","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium to W.R. Berkley.As with other insurers, W.R. Berkley's biggest risks are claims in excess of the amount reserved or material impairments in its investment portfolio. The firm has large exposures to municipal and corporate bonds in its investment portfolios and did take a hit during the financial crisis because of an investment in Fannie Mae preferred stock. The company may face large claims experience because of poor underwriting or factors like underpriced claims inflation, and the specialty nature of its lines creates more potential for unforeseen claims to arise.Some environmental, social, and governance issues for P&C insurers arise in a secondhand fashion, through the industries the insurer serves or investments. For commercial insurers, insuring industries with a high level of ESG risk could draw criticism and potentially lead to lost revenue if the situation becomes untenable. Insurers can also draw criticism on the extent to which the insurer incorporates ESG into its investment decisions. But we see this issue as relatively minor, as shifting investment practices should be a relatively easy fix. The biggest issue for P&C insurers is climate change, as insurers typically cover weather-related losses, and climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Insurers profitability could be significantly impaired if they do not recognize these risks and adjust their underwriting practices accordingly. While W.R. Berkley faces all these issues, we do not see any particular flags for the company.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for W.R. Berkley is Exemplary. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are exceptional, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.Bill Berkley has been chair of the company that bears his name since its formation in 1967 and historically cultivated a decentralized operating structure and culture that prioritizes underwriting profitability. Managers of subsidiaries are rewarded for long-term profitability and value creation, while managers at the corporate level allocate capital opportunistically where pricing is the most advantageous. Berkley has demonstrated the ability to successfully enter and exit insurance lines as pricing develops, and loss ratios at W.R. Berkley have been remarkably stable relative to peers, which we believe highlights the company's strong underwriting discipline. The approach does have its drawbacks, as an unwillingness to pare staff can lead to a relatively high expense ratio during soft pricing periods, but we think returns over the cycle have shown the wisdom of this course. In the current environment, we think W.R. Berkley's operating leverage has been a material positive, and we expect near-term results to highlight the positives of this approach.Bill Berkley is firmly in control, as he holds nearly 20% of the outstanding shares of the company, although he stepped down as CEO and assumed the executive chair role in 2015. His son, Rob Berkley, took over as CEO. Rob Berkley has worked at the company for more than 20 years and previously held the COO title. We didn't expect this move to result in any significant changes as Bill Berkley remains involved in managing the company and has significant financial incentive to make sure the company stays disciplined. Further, Rob's comments since taking the CEO role strongly suggest he shares his father's views of the appropriate strategy for the company, and we believe he has largely stayed the course.","W.R. Berkley is an insurance holding company with a host of subsidiaries that primarily underwrite commercial casualty insurance. The firm specializes in niche products that include various excess and surplus lines, workers' compensation insurance, self-insurance consulting, reinsurance, and regional commercial lines for small and midsize businesses.","W.R. Berkley's equity/assets ratio of 20% at the end of 2022 is a bit below industry averages, but we consider it acceptable, given the nature of the company's lines and the relative lack of catastrophe exposure. The current level is toward the low end of the company's historical average, but we expect it to move back in line over time. W.R. Berkley's investment portfolio is fairly typical for the industry, with most of the money invested in municipal bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. But W.R. Berkley shortened the duration of its portfolio in anticipation of a rise in interest rates and shifted its allocation toward investments that generate returns primarily through capital appreciation. While the company is now set to realize the upside to this tactic, this increased near-term pressure on investment income. Still, we believe its investment portfolio is reasonably safe and this move is unlikely to have a material effect on our valuation or the company's financial health.",WRB,Financial Services,18891702272.0,NYQ,1652333.0,USD,71.06999969482422,True,0,64.41917643827529,77.73938289689629,1
25/11/2023,Corning Drives a Moat From Centralized Research and Development Across Many Markets,Corning Inc,GLW,4,24/10/2023,William Kerwin,28.2,USD,24/11/2023,35.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,B,24/10/2023,"We lower our fair value estimate for shares of narrow-moat Corning to $35, from $39, after management guided fourth-quarter results lower than our expectations. Cornings reported results in the third quarter were weak, but within our expectations, as the firm continues to see softer demand for its optical fiber, which is its largest segment. We now expect this segment to stay at these depressed levels for at least two more quarters. On the bright side, we like Cornings focus on improving profitability and cash flow while it waits for volumes to return. Despite our fair value cut, we continue to view the market as overly punitive toward Corning shares and see the stock as a buying opportunity for investors. We fully expect the company to recover from its current downcycle. Long term, we believe it is positioned for diversified growth, fueled by its centralized research and development budget that we see giving the firm a cost advantage. Third-quarter non-GAAP sales declined 6% year over year and 1% sequentially to $3.5 billion. Once again the decline was focused in the optical communications segment, which dropped 30% year over year. Carrier customers in particular, like Verizon and AT&T, are working through existing fiber inventories, which is slowing orders for Cornings product. We see this current downcycle as exacerbated from heightened orders and buildouts during the pandemic that held many people at home. Other segments fared better, with display glass benefiting from Cornings higher pricing and cover glass sales benefiting from smartphone launches at Apple and Samsung. Cornings non-GAAP gross margin improved 80 basis points sequentially to 37%, despite the decline in sales. Management has actively been working on cost efficiency and adjusting its own utilization to improve profits and cash flow during the optical market downturn, and we expect these efforts to continue bearing fruit.","Corning boasts a leading share in four distinct end markets: display glass, optical fiber, cover glass, and emissions substrates/filters. Corning's portfolio is aligned toward global secular trends of increasing connectivity and efficiency. Corning's debt has the longest average time to maturity of the entire S&P 500, giving it ample time and liquidity to fulfill its obligations.","Corning operates in highly capital-intensive markets that limit its free cash flow conversion. Corning has a concentrated customer base, particularly for glass panels, and the loss of any single customer relationship could prove material to revenue. Corning relies on a hefty research and development budget to maintain its leadership position in its markets, and any slowdown in its pace of innovation could allow a competitor to close the gap.",24/10/2023,"Corning is a materials science behemoth with differentiated glass products for televisions, notebooks, mobile devices, wearables, optical fiber, cars, and pharmaceutical packaging. In its 170 years of operation, the company has constantly innovated (including inventing glass optical fiber and ceramic substrates for catalytic converters) and oriented itself toward evolving demand trends that it can serve through its core competency of materials science. Most recently, we point to Cornings domination of the smartphone cover glass market and deals with U.S. network carriers to supply fiber for 5G buildouts as evidence of the pivot toward growth. Corning is able to use its scale to invest heavily in research and development$1 billion or more per yearand spread these expenses across its five segments. We think centralizing R&D allows the firm to manufacture products for a materially lower cost than its competitors, all while using this hefty investment to maintain an innovation lead that results in leading share positions in its end markets. Cornings cost advantage and intangible assets result in a narrow economic moat, in our view. We expect Corning to continue focusing resources on opportunities that align with secular trends toward connectivity and efficiency. We view the firm as a key enabler of 5G networks, providing the fiber backbone to network operators as well as selling Gorilla Glass into phone back panels to enable millimeter wave reception. We also expect Cornings ceramic substrates and gasoline particulate filters to enable automotive OEMs to achieve rising efficiency standards around the world. The firm is also poised to continue dominating the market for thin display glass as it operates three of the world's four Gen 10.5 plantsthe cutting edge for 65-inch and 75-inch screens. Finally, we think the firms pharmaceutical glasses will continue to disrupt the market for applications in vaccines, genomics, and drug development.","We award Corning a narrow economic moat rating, based on a firmwide cost advantage and intangible assets in certain segments. The combination of Cornings competitive advantages across its business gives us confidence that it will earn returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital for the better part of the next decade. Corning has five segments: optical communications, display technologies, environmental technologies, specialty materials, and life sciences. While the segments sell into very different applications, Corning is a leader in each one because of its proficiency in materials science, gained through 170 years of operation and innovation. These markets are typically characterized by specialized competition, and Corning is the only company that plays in all five, boasting a leading market share in all but life sciences. As a result of diversified end markets with a common theme of materials science, Corning benefits from a cost advantage through massive and centralized annual research and development expenses (more than $1 billion) that benefit and are spread across all of its segments. Corning operates in a so-called 3-4-5 framework, with three core technologies (glass science, ceramic science, optical physics), four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. Management focuses 80% of its resources on opportunities that leverage at least two of these technologies and platforms. The firm credits this strategy for numerous product innovations, including iterations of its marquee Gorilla Glass and advances in optical fiber. Overall, we think this strategy means that Corning can consistently outspend its competitors on R&D to maintain its leading share in most markets while still producing its products at a lower cost. We point to Cornings gross margins and operating margins leading every single one of its competitors across end markets as evidence. Cornings largest segment is optical communications, which revolves around the manufacture of optical fiber. Optical fiber is a broadband solution made out of strands of glass or plastic thinner than a human hair, which offers superior performance to incumbent copper cabling in broadband networks. Cornings fiber transmits data by coding it into pulses of light that are sent through pure glass, compared with copper, which transmits electrons. This allows data transmission at the speed of light, with high bandwidth and low loss. While optical fiber was initially used in niche applications (after Corning invented it in 1970) because it cost more than copper, bandwidth needs of the 21st century and reductions in cost are making it the new standard in broadband access. Corning is working with cellular networks like Verizon and AT&T to provide a fiber backbone to their 5G network buildouts as well as providing fiber to the home to cities and communities to improve their home broadband. The firm also works with hyperscalers to input optical fiber into data centers. Corning is a vertically integrated optical fiber manufacturer, controlling every part of the process from taking raw materials and producing a final optical fiber cable, even manufacturing its own furnaces and machines for production. Corning invented and uses to this day a process to create its fiber called outside vapor deposition, or OVD, to produce its fiber. This is a lengthy process that involves coating a bait rod evenly with a vapor solution that gets heated layer by layer to create a preformessentially a thick tube of glassthat then gets heated and purified into a blank, where impurities are measured in parts per billion. Finally, the blank is suspended several stories in the air and the tip is heated to the point where a gob of pure liquid glass drips down, thinning and solidifying as it does. This becomes a hair-thin strand of optical fiber. According to Corning, a single blank (the size of a tube of salami) can produce a few thousand kilometers of optical fiber. While many firms produce their own optical fiber cabling (by outsourcing for the fibers themselves), there are only about 15 firms globally that manufacture fiber from scratch, with vertically integrated leaders Corning, Prysmian, and Yangtze Optical Fibre and Cable taking up about 40% of the market, according to Network Telecom and Thomas Publishing. Corning sells optical fiber at every stage in the process. It sells preforms and finished spools of optical fiber to third-party cable manufacturers and manufactures its own fiber cables as finished products, along with cable assemblies and accessories. Corning is constantly refining its OVD process to produce more fiber from a single blank, and it is able to leverage its centralized R&D spending to do so. Management has credited investments in the 3-4-5 framework for doubling the length of fiber produced from the same-diameter blank. We think this continued innovation results in a persistent cost advantage for Cornings optical business, with gross margins consistently more than 1,000 basis points above those of YOFC, its closest peer in global market share. Although Corning has decades of R&D that have gone into perfecting its proprietary OVD process, we would not assign an intangible asset moat source to its optical segment, as competitors like YOFC have also developed optical fiber that meets the needs of many customers in the marketplacejust at a higher cost. Cornings second-largest segment is display technologies. Within display technologies, Corning supplies flat-panel glass into liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode televisions, as well as into notebooks and other displays. To produce flat-panel glass to be used in televisions, Corning uses its proprietary fusion draw process. The fusion draw entails pouring molten glass into a pentagonal trough until it spills over the edges and drips down a height of six stories slowly through open air, thinning and solidifying as it descends. The ingenuity of this process is that the glass never touches another surface during its formation, greatly reducing surface imperfections and the need for additional polishing. This is in contrast to the traditional float method used by competitors Asahi Glass Co. and Nippon Electric Glass, where glass sheets form over a bed of molten tin before getting polished and finished. We think Corning can produce these high-quality glass substrates at a lower cost than its competitors as a result of its centralized R&D. Corning uses the same fusion draw process to make glass substrates for both its display technologies and specialty materials segments, which it credits for saving upward of $1 billion in investment, on top of the money it saves per substrate on refining and polishing. We think these dynamics exhibit themselves in industry-leading margins far and away above Cornings nearest competitors. Cornings gross margins come in consistently in the upper 30s (barring an exceptional 2020), while AGC and NEG are stuck in the mid-20s. Cornings operating margins are stable in the low to midteens compared with AGC and NEG, which are stagnant in the high single digits. This is all while Corning more than doubles the R&D spending of these competitors, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. We also think that Corning enjoys a virtuous cycle in its glass production between its cost-advantaged position and intangible assets in the production of thin glass substrates. Corning invents and manufactures all of its own equipment and machinery for its fusion draw, which produces best-of-breed display glass, which we think has resulted in its leading market share. Glassmaking is a high-fixed-cost business, with more than half of Cornings manufacturing costs being fixed. The display glass market is an oligopoly, with Corning, AGC, and NEG taking up an estimated 95% share, of which Corning accounts for half. Because Cornings sales are double those of its closest competitor, AGC, it can spread its fixed costs over a larger volume, resulting in an enduring lower average cost per glass substrate. Corning can then use the money it saves to reinvest in innovating its production processes even more and continue to reliably outprofit its competition. Finally, Cornings display business presents meaningful switching costs to its customers as a result of co-location and co-investment, although we cant say that all of Cornings businesses benefit from similar switching costs. Due to the inherently fragile nature of sheets of glass as large as 100 square feet in area and as thin as 0.5 millimeters, the firms display plants are located next to customer facilities to reduce the risk of lost inventory and to save on travel time and expense. Additionally, when Corning builds a display glass plant, it secures over 75% of the initial investment outlay from customers and partners. These plants can cost up to $7 billion to build (and often a 10-year supply agreement), creating a strong incentive for customers to maintain their relationship and earn a return on their large investment. We think panel manufacturers that partner with Corning would be hard-pressed to lose the sunk cost of a billion-dollar investment and reduce their own production for multiple years to arrange for a new source for glass.Cornings specialty materials segment features sales of its marquee Gorilla Glass and its exclusive arrangement with Apple for Ceramic Shield. Gorilla Glass is the protective cover glass designed into nearly three fourths of the global smartphone market (including every Apple iPhone before the iPhone 12, which first featured Ceramic Shield), as well as into wearables, tablets, and notebooks. Corning invented Gorilla Glass in 2006, when Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs gave the firm six months to design a cover glass for the first iPhone. Gorilla Glass is known in the industry as best of breed, and we think this is exemplified by its stranglehold on the global smartphone market, with a 73% share in 2016, according to EMR (the latest share data we can find). Corning cover glass is found in every premium smartphone on the market (iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Huawei Mate, to name a few) while its chief competitors, AGCs Dragontrail and NEGs Dinorex, are largely featured in economy phones. We think the firms specialty materials segment enjoys the same cost advantage in the production of glass as it does in its display technologies segment. Cornings Gorilla Glass is produced using the same proprietary fusion draw process as it does for display glass, which again has helped save $1 billion in investment and allows the firm to save money on refining and polishing versus the competition. We credit these dynamics for resulting in industry-leading gross margins well above those of AGC and NEG. Cornings synergies between display and specialty materials, along with its unparalleled scale in the cover glass market, allow it to consistently achieve operating margins 500-plus basis points above its chief competitors. We also think Cornings 15 years of dominance in the premium smartphone market reflect the same virtuous cycle of intangible assets and a cost advantage in durable cover glass production. Corning claims its sales of cover glass are 10 times that of the nearest cover glass competitor, meaning it can spread its fixed costs over a large production volume even more so than it does in display glass, reducing its average cost per substrate and allowing the firm to reinvest money saved to maintain its innovation lead over the industry. Cornings environmental technologies segment sells ceramic substrates and particulate filters into the catalytic converters for gasoline- and diesel-powered cars and trucks. Corning invented ceramic substrates for emissions control in 1970 following the U.S. Clean Air Act. Gas and diesel engines produce toxic pollutants that can render air harmful to breathe, and the Clean Air Act was the first legislation to target a reduction in those emissions. Substrates and filters are a one-two punch to accomplish this, with substrates removing gaseous pollutants and filters taking out toxic particulates. Substrates are a solid ceramic in a honeycomb shape coated in catalytic materials that turn harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide into gaseous nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. Corning can pack a surface area the size of a football field into a product roughly the size of a can of soda. Currently, while most diesel engines use a substrate and filter, most cars only use a substrate. However, the demand for gasoline particulate filters, or GPFs, is greatly expanding as a result of global emissions regulation. The typical internal combustion engine emits trillions of particulates every mile, and regulations like Euro 6 and China 6 require a 99% reduction, which only an advanced GPF can accomplish.We think Corning benefits from a cost advantage in substrates and filters, again stemming from its centralized R&D spending, as well as a virtuous cycle with intangible assets in ceramic substrate production. Corning occupies a plurality of the GPF market, with 27% share; the top three firms combined made up 60% of the total market in 2019, according to 360 Research. Corning invented this industry, and after five decades of innovation, we think it possesses intangible assets in ceramic substrate and filter production that have resulted in its leading share. Similar to the dynamics in its glass businesses, Corning can divide hefty fixed costs across a greater volume than its competition, resulting in materially lower average costs and industry-leading margins. Among its competition, it is rivaled only by NGK Insulators in margin performance, and we think the two hold a cost advantage over the rest of the field. Both Cornings and NGKs operating margins have trended around 15% of revenue since 2015more than double that of the next largest firms by market share, Ibiden and Faureciaall while they dwarf their competitors R&D expenditures. Cornings final segment is life sciences, where the firm produces glass equipment for pharmaceutical research, development, and production. The firms marquee product in this segment is Valor Glass, which reduces particle contamination in pharmaceutical packaging and elevates production throughput via reduced breaking or cracking compared with incumbent pharmaceutical glass. While we think Cornings life sciences segment benefits from its centralized R&D spending (which led to the invention of Valor Glass), we dont consider this segment moatworthy in isolation. It is already a $1 billion business for Corning but goes up against massive incumbents like Thermo Fisher and Danaher, which generate several billion dollars in revenue from pharmaceutical packaging alone, on top of massive R&D budgets and lasting customer relationships. Still, we think Valor Glass could be an industry disrupter, and as Corning continues to take market share, we may deem its life sciences segment as moatworthy in the future.","We assign Corning a medium uncertainty rating. The firm must continuously innovate to stave off competition in each of its end markets, which are constantly evolving. We think that any stagnation in Cornings ability to innovate, or renewed vigor or capital intensity from a competitor, could eat into Cornings leading market share. Still, we dont think Cornings end markets are at great risk of disruptive new entrants, given the massive capital intensity and research and development required. Corning also faces risk from its global business model. Corning earns roughly two thirds of its revenue outside the U.S. and has to carefully manage fluctuations in exchange rates with large currency hedges. If Corning were to fail to implement the proper hedges, it could face volatility in its results from changes in exchange rates. Additionally, Corning earns more than $3 billion from China, and any trade tensions between China and the company's domicile of the U.S. could affect its ability to do business. Corning has a concentrated customer base, specifically in its display business. Display technologies account for a bulk of Cornings profits, and the four largest customers account for more than 70% of segment revenue. If Corning were to lose one of these customer relationships, it would materially affect the top line. Nevertheless, Corning operates numerous plants with each of its large customers, typically with multiyear supply agreements, which we think insulates it against the risk of losing an entire customer relationship. Finally, we dont foresee major environmental, social, and governance risk for Corning over our explicit forecast. The company has a substantial carbon footprint from its manufacturing, but it has been implementing solar energy at facilities and is committed to increasing its use of renewables by 400% in 2030.","We rate Cornings capital allocation as Exemplary based on a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. The firm has consistently balanced investments in its own innovation with dividends and share repurchases, and we expect this to continue.We rate Cornings balance sheet as sound, due to long-dated debt maturities, low net debt relative to EBITDA, and our assessment of enterprise value. Corning uses its extremely long debt maturity profile to invest in growth and reinforce its firmwide cost advantage and intangible assets, which gives rise to exceptional investments, in our view. Corning operates via what it calls a 3-4-5 framework. The firm has broken out its core competencies into three technologies, four engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. The framework calls for management to devote at least 80% of its investments toward opportunities that benefit two or more of these core competencies. We think this is a core tenet of Cornings cost advantage through centralized research and development and has been responsible for innovations like Gorilla Glass that propel Cornings cash generation. When Corning invests capital in a project, we think it has a good record of reducing its risk via purchase agreements and co-investment. In its display business, it builds plants adjacent to customer facilities and secures 75% of the capital investment from customers and downstream partners. This co-located and co-invested dynamic both reduces Cornings initial outlay and ensures every member of the production relationship is motivated to produce an attractive return. Additionally, Corning has secured $450 million in cumulative investment from Apple to continue developing new iterations of Gorilla Glass and Ceramic Shield, which is deemed crucial to future iPhone innovation. Corning also focuses its mergers and acquisitions on opportunities to expand the reach of its existing businesses, shown most recently through its bolt-on of 3Ms communication markets division in 2018, which broadened the geographic reach of its optical segment into Europe and Asia. Finally, we think Corning appropriately returns its ample leftover cash to investors. Under its 2016-19 capital allocation plan, the firm sought to generate more than $20 billion in cash over four years, supplementing strong operating cash generation with new long-term debt. Management planned to allocate $10 billion of its cash to R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions while returning $10 billion more to shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Corning exceeded these lofty targets, generating $26 billion in cash and investing $12 billion in capital expenditures, R&D, and acquisitions, while returning $12.5 billion to shareholders. Cornings capital allocation plan for 2020-23 involves generating $16 billion-$18 billion in operating cash flow alone, up from the $13 billion generated under the prior framework. Management plans to invest $10 billion-$12 billion in the business, with approximately $3 billion going to R&D, $1 billion going to bolt-on M&A, and the rest going toward capital investments. The firm plans to return $8 billion-$10 billion to shareholders via $5 billion-$7 billion in repurchases and 10% annual growth in its dividend. The firm also expects compound annual revenue growth of 6%-8% in this period, with earnings growth of 12%-15%.","Corning is a leader in materials science, specializing in the production of glass, ceramics, and optical fiber. The firm supplies its products for a wide range of applications, from flat-panel displays in televisions to gasoline particulate filters in automobiles to optical fiber for broadband access, with a leading share in many of its end markets.","We think Corning is in a stable financial position. The firm uses a combination of debt and strong operating cash generation to fund its capital and debt obligations, and we expect this trend to continue. As of Dec. 31, 2022, Corning had $6.9 billion in total debt and $1.7 billion in cash on hand. While the firm is highly leveraged, it has the longest debt maturity of any S&P 500 company, with debt maturities upward of 20, 30, and 40 years. Through 2027, the company has less than $1 billion coming due. Corning is a reliable generator of free cash flow, despite capital-intensive businesses. Since the end of its most recent capital-intensive build phase in 2019, Corning has averaged over $1 billion in annual free cash flow, even through macroeconomic headwinds in 2022. We expect this average to grow to $2 billion over our five-year explicit forecast.",GLW,Technology,24605566976.0,NYQ,3631951.0,USD,28.200000762939453,True,1,30.240705961344702,31.06707317073049,1
25/11/2023,Kroger's Private-Label Arsenal and Data-Driven Promotional Capabilities Should Capture Trade-Down,The Kroger Co,KR,4,08/09/2023,Dan Wasiolek,43.82,USD,23/11/2023,55.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,B,08/09/2023,"Narrow-moat Kroger shares moved up 3% on news it would divest 413-650 Albertson stores to competitor C&S, to meet regulatory concerns of its proposed acquisition of Albertson, allowing for a potential completion early next year. We still see regulatory uncertainty, though, as C&S stands to have 600-750 units, while the combined Kroger/Albertson would have a meaningfully larger 4,600 unit footprint. Apparently, the market concords with our view, with Albertson trading around $24 per share, below Krogers $34 per share cash offer. We dont see much in Krogers second-quarter results that would materially change our $55 fair value estimate, as slightly lower 2023 sales growth expectations are offset by a reset in our average fuel price forecast beyond this year. With shares trading around 10 times forward earnings, versus about 12 times on average during 2018-19, we see shares as undervalued. Same-store sales (excluding fuel) rose 1% in the period, weighed down by an Express Scripts terminated contract at the end of last calendar year, a tough 5.8% year-ago comparison, and a value-seeking consumer in a food disinflationary environment (Kroger now sees food inflation ending the year at 1%-2% versus 3%-4% prior). Fuel averaged $3.65 a gallon in the quarter, down from $4.62 a year ago. With the environment expected to remain challenging, Kroger now sees same-store sales at the low end of its 1%-2% guidance for the full year, and we plan to adjust our 2% prognosis toward 1%. That said, we now see 2024-27 total revenue growth averaging 1%-2% versus 1% previously on higher fuel price expectations. Despite higher promotions and shrink, Krogers gross margins increased 35 basis points to 21.8%. This is in line with our 2023 forecast of 21.7%, which is up from 21.4% in the prior year. Long term, we expect margins to remain around this level, as intense competition is offset by Krogers strong loyalty program, attractive private label offering, and industry scale.","With a number-one or -two standing in most of its major markets, Kroger benefits from local scale, spreading advertising, distribution, and supply chain expenses over a large sales base. While the digitization of grocery has upended the sector, Kroger's size allows it to invest in the omnichannel experience, using its advantaged store network to capitalize on digital opportunities. Kroger's customer data set is among the best in retail; it should be able to use the information it has to target promotions, inform its assortment, and sell marketing insights.","Competition in grocery is fierce from physical and digital sellers alike, necessitating continued investment in the store experience and low prices to maintain store traffic. The pandemic accelerated grocerys digitization, shifting more sales into a less lucrative channel before the Ocado partnership is fully realized. Rapid change in the sector is forcing Kroger to quickly adopt new business models (such as delivery, click-and-collect, and data analytics meant for sale to outside parties), putting a larger premium on nimble execution.",31/07/2023,"Of the traditional grocers, we believe Kroger's scale, partnerships, private-label fare, and data capabilities uniquely position it to defend its returns against a competitive onslaught that should intensify as Amazon, mass merchandisers, and hard discounters price aggressively to boost volume. Thus, we contend that Kroger still benefits from enduring intangible assets and cost advantages (even if its acquisition of Albertsons is derailed by regulators). Grocers use price as a primary lever to drive traffic, necessitating efficiency and cost leverage (spurred by high traffic) to deliver returns. We expect this environment to endure as the industry changes, with an omnichannel experience likely to prevail as customers use a combination of deliver-to-home, click-and-collect, and in-store shopping, particularly since most American consumers drive past grocers on their commutes and home delivery can be inconvenient for buyers with uncertain schedules (although the COVID-19 pandemic likely accelerated delivery adoption in the long term). In physical retail, we anticipate shoppers will choose sellers based on convenience, price, and breadth of assortment, demanding high value as well as a compelling store environment. Kroger should be able to capitalize on the changing landscape. We maintain that its local market scale allows it to derive cost leverage that fuels competitive pricing and the investments needed to build on its presence in the emerging channels. Its progress should be accelerated by partnerships (with Ocado, Walgreens, Microsoft, and others) that we do not believe are available to smaller rivals because they cannot deliver the same value to counterparts. Nearly all Kroger's transactions are derived from its loyalty database, providing consumer insights that should play a large role in its digital transformation, fueling promotional efforts and customer engagement while informing assortment and providing salable insights as non-grocery revenue streams. We expect data to play a key role in retailers' efforts to drive traffic, efficiency, and conversion that few can match.","We assign Kroger a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and a cost advantage. Our rating considers Kroger as a stand-alone entity, independent of its proposed acquisition of no-moat Albertsons (which we suspect will be viewed negatively by antitrust regulators). We assume that Kroger's average returns on invested capital (including goodwill), at about 11%, exceed our estimate of its weighted average cost of capital by around 400 basis points over the next decade.The U.S. grocery industry is highly competitive, with an already-intense rivalry among traditional grocery stores, mass merchandisers, and club stores inflamed by wide-moat Amazon's 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods and broader push into the sector. Considering the price competition that permeates the industry, we believe there is an increasing premium on the cost leverage that scale affords, including in the emerging digital grocery realm. While this places most conventional grocers at a disadvantage, we contend that Kroger's scale, vast library of customer transaction data (amassed over decades), private-label strength (accounting for more than $30 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue, which we estimate was roughly 30% of unit sales), and advantaged locations set it apart from its rivals.As the largest pure grocer in the United States (trailing only wide-moat Walmart in overall grocery sales and at nearly double the revenue of number-two Albertsons), Kroger is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its size with vendors while also leveraging costs. The scale advantages emerge at a local and national level.Locally, Kroger held a number-one or number-two market share in about 90% of the major markets it operated in as of late 2019 (according to Planet Retail and Edge Retail Insight data cited by Kroger). We believe this scale is vital, as it allows a grocer to leverage distribution and advertising costs in a way that smaller competitors cannot. Kroger can use its transaction volume within a local area to keep trucks full and distribution centers operating at nearly full capacity. Subscale participants, including online sellers, are forced to incur similar costs, particularly since many products are perishable, without the turnover needed to maximize operating profits. Kroger turned inventory nearly 16 times in fiscal 2022, well ahead of Albertsons' 11 times, which we believe is an indication of the economic benefits of scale even between the top two market participants. Furthermore, Kroger's leading local market position allows it to derive a better return on local advertising expenditures, with traditional media costs in the market spread over a larger sales base.On a national level, we believe the firm's scale allows it to capitalize on the digitization of grocery. We believe an omnichannel approach is most likely to prevail in the sector, with customers using a combination of delivery to home, click-and-collect, and in-store sales to purchase their items. However, we believe the click-and-collect approach will be especially prevalent in the United States relative to other developed economies, as it is often more convenient for a customer who is already driving to or from work or other engagements to stop at a nearby grocer than schedule their lives around the arrival of a delivery of (often perishable) items. This should reward firms that can combine local market scale with cost leverage over national omnichannel investments (such as digital ordering platforms, distribution network optimization, and the development of intimate relationships with vendors to ensure products are packaged in a way that is conducive to a variety of fulfillment options and presented in such a way that they carry appeal in person and in a picture online), as well as labor-saving initiatives, including automation and mobile-based checkout. Kroger's scope should allow it to manage the transition of trade spending; for example, the firm offers boosted search placements to food manufacturers, allowing them to pay to have their products listed at the top of search results in a high-impression, high-conversion venue.Kroger's top line is nearly double that of Albertsons, the second-largest pure-play grocer in the United States. The U.S. grocery industry is highly fragmented, with the top four grocers only holding about 40% market share and Kroger's management indicating that around one third of the market is held by smaller scale operators (citing data from Planet Retail and Edge Retail Insight). We believe unscaled retailers will serve as share donors as digital and deep discount rivals grow. We contend that Kroger's ability to leverage distribution costs, investments in omnichannel offerings, and supply chain capabilities should allow it to continue to outperform its pure-play rivals. Additionally, we believe Kroger's in-house production of many of its private-label offerings bolsters its cost standing in addition to improving the quality of its assortment, with smaller rivals unable to justify the investment needed to follow the same path. Kroger's scale fuels valuable intangible assets that we believe will be difficult for rivals to replicate. The company has met the challenge of digital grocery with partnerships with a variety of firms, tie-ups that we believe are enabled by Kroger's significant size, established market position, and grocery industry leadership as it is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful value to its counterparts. Kroger is offering much of its own-branded product lineup at certain Walgreens locations, including its recently acquired Home Chef meal kits; working with Instacart on home delivery as a bridge to further developing its own capabilities; and using autonomous vehicle startup Nuro to send grocery orders to customers using a test fleet of driverless cars. Additionally, the firm announced a partnership with Microsoft in early 2019 that will see the two giants develop digital-rich stores and an as-a-service software suite that will be marketed to other retailers. We contend that these initiatives will ease Kroger's ongoing evolution, combining the firm's formidable scale with emerging approaches in a way that few rivals can match.Perhaps most intriguingly, Kroger established an exclusive relationship in the United States with European online grocery leader Ocado in 2018, taking a mid-single-digit percentage stake in the firm. According to its filings, Kroger's investment in Ocado had a market value of around $400 million as of the end of fiscal 2022. We believe the deal should significantly accelerate Kroger's development of its deliver-to-home and click-and-collect offerings, with Ocado's flexible, low-cost warehouse-based model extending Kroger's reach beyond its existing markets in a cost-efficient, tested manner. Ocado's highly automated warehouse approach should allow Kroger to compete effectively with Amazon, creating the flexibility to serve orders from dedicated centers that would not incur the same order picking costs that constrain profitability when fulfilling from a traditional store. Furthermore, the deal's exclusivity takes Ocado off the table as a potential partner for smaller retailers looking to quickly expand their delivery presence, while also foreclosing future direct competition with the digital seller.On the private-label front, we believe Kroger's strong suite of offerings adds to its intangible assets, bolstering its brand in consumers' eyes. Unlike rivals, Kroger manufactures around 40% of its own brand grocery offerings, allowing it to elevate quality while containing production costs. Its efforts have allowed Kroger to position its labels (particularly Simple Truth and Private Selection, which cater toward customers seeking clean-label and premium options) as a branded-equivalent alternative, often with flavors and characteristics that are not available elsewhere. Kroger's labels are the largest brands sold at its stores, accounting for roughly 30% of unit sales excluding fuel and pharmacy (ahead of a U.S. penetration rate of around 15%-20%). We believe the quality and value of Kroger's own labels spurs customer affinity for the stores while differentiating the assortment from rivals, bolstering the company's standing with shoppers (and traffic) even as the company sells meaningfully more lucrative product. The firm's move to introduce an assortment of own-brand products at Walgreens should extend the value of the brands further.Kroger's grocery stores are often paired with fuel stations and a pharmacy, both of which we believe add recurring customer traffic and further embed the company's stores into shoppers' daily routines. Over 80% of Kroger's locations boast pharmacies and roughly 60% have fuel centers, initiatives which are difficult for rivals to implement from scratch.We contend that Kroger's vast trove of customer data reflects and constitutes a powerful intangible asset that should unlock opportunities for targeted advertising and promotions, in-store advertising, assortment optimization, and analytics sales to vendors. Nearly all of its transactions are tied to a loyalty card, leaving Kroger with more than 60 million households' worth of behavioral information and data that extends back years. We believe the robustness of this data set is the richest in the industry, giving Kroger lifecycle insight into shoppers' buying behaviors.Kroger monetizes this information in a number of ways, with plans to significantly expand its use of data analytics and sell related insights underway (spearheaded by its in-house analytics firm, 84.51). Most readily, the company is able to use purchase history to target promotions and discounts, boosting customer engagement and traffic while increasing the return on its marketing investments and refining its local market assortment. Furthermore, the rewards program offers Kroger ways to incentivize traffic through fuel and recurring pharmacy sales by offering points and discounts based on purchases made.We believe that Kroger can use its low-margin grocery business to fuel high-margin data, media, and personal finance (including credit card) revenue, somewhat analogous to wide-moat Costco's use of nearly break-even merchandise sales to drive the membership fees that constitute the majority of its operating income.While several non-U.S. grocers that we cover carry no-moat ratings, we believe Krogers capabilities and the nature of the American market have allowed it to maintain a competitive edge. The grocery sector in the United States is fragmented, leading us to believe that subscale retailers that have neither the cost leverage nor the ability to invest in the omnichannel experience and private label to the same extent as Kroger are the likely market share donors for new and growing entrants (Amazon and the hard discounters). Combined with its data insights into the key U.S. market and the likelihood that click-and-collect and in-store shopping will remain relevant in the country (considering the prevalence of driving commutes), we contend that Krogers unique combination of a strong store network, procurement leverage, and the resources needed to keep pace with changing industry demands will keep it better-positioned than most of the pure grocers we cover. Taken together, we believe these factors contribute to an efficiency that underlies Kroger's approximately $825 fiscal 2022 sales per square foot mark, which easily outperformed Albertsons' roughly $635 in its fiscal 2021 and is ahead of all but Costco in our defensive retail coverage.","We assign Kroger a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.Inflation and economic turbulence inject near-term volatility as Kroger faces rising costs and shifting spending patterns. Longer term, a fast-changing grocery environment amid intense competition in all channels in a sector with limited switching costs constitutes the primary threat to our outlook.Amazon still looms, particularly as it evolves its online offering and augments Whole Foods with mainstream physical grocery locations, as does Walmart, which is amid an omnichannel push. While we believe Kroger has done well to embrace the industry's future, consumer buying habits are unsettled as food purchases are increasingly nationalized, upending the traditional distance- and routine-based relationship between customers and grocers. The dynamic could work to Krogers benefit or detriment; if execution is strong, it could benefit from smaller grocers' struggle to keep pace, but if customers look elsewhere, the chain could find itself with too many stores and persistently diminishing economics. We believe price competition in grocery is endemic, necessitating scale-based economies and efficient execution; while we anticipate Kroger will meet the challenge, the stakes are high. The pandemic likely accelerated online grocery adoption, a near-term challenge as digital orders are currently less lucrative but a possible long-term opportunity as the Ocado partnership scales and improves economics.Kroger's efforts to monetize its consumer data introduce noteworthy but likely immaterial governance-related risk. While Kroger sells aggregated insights and not customer contact information or purchasing history, a breach could impair the value of its transaction data. With switching costs low, data breaches or food-safety missteps in its private-label portfolio could have an impact on performance. Also, Kroger faces some social risks associated with managing a workforce that numbered about 430,000 at the end of fiscal 2022.","We assign Kroger an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating.Under CEO Rodney McMullen (in office since January 2014), Kroger has featured a sound balance sheet, even prior to the pandemics windfall for grocers. Net debt averaged 2.6 times adjusted EBITDA in the three years prior to the pandemic, with the metric falling to 1.6 times on average in fiscal 2020-22. Debt maturities are well managed, with less than $500 million due on average annually over the next three years, against around $1 billion in balance sheet cash at the end of fiscal 2022.Krogers exceptional record of investment spans its organic omnichannel development work and execution as well as its acquisition history. McMullen and his team have operated the business well despite an intensely competitive environment that necessitates rapid change and strong execution. We have a favorable view of McMullen's moves to build Kroger's omnichannel offering, capitalizing on its store network and local market scale to keep the chain relevant in a digitized grocery landscape. Furthermore, we maintain that his pursuit of partnerships with Walgreens, Ocado, Instacart, Microsoft, and others have helped Kroger develop necessary competencies in alternative channels without adding to capital investment needs or incurring the associated growing pains to the same extent as a solely in-house strategy. Additionally, continuing efforts to capitalize on Kroger's vast transaction data library should help offset competitive pressures.The firm divested its convenience store unit in 2018, netting just over $2 billion for the business in a deal we viewed favorably from a valuation and strategic standpoint as it allowed Kroger to refocus on its core activities. Part of the proceeds were used to buy a stake in Ocado, a leading European online grocer, with the ensuing partnership (which is exclusive if certain performance criteria are met) meant to build a network of highly automated fulfillment centers as the two firms develop their digital sales capabilities in the United States. We view the partnership positively as it should improve Krogers omnichannel economics while accelerating its learning process with newer fulfillment methods.Although we are doubtful that Krogers proposed $25 billion acquisition of Albertsons will be received favorably by regulators, we believe management can balance the acquisition process with the agility needed to maintain strong execution. Even if the transaction results in the company purchasing substantially less than all of Albertsons stores, we believe the move could be worth the risk, in that it would add new markets while aiding Krogers relationships with vendors and ability to scale costs.Managements record of shareholder distributions seems appropriate. The firm has long used share buybacks and dividends to return capital to shareholders, repurchasing nearly $6 billion over the past five years and paying around 25% of earnings on average, respectively. While Kroger has purchased stock at inopportune times (at prices higher than our fair value estimates), we believe it has wisely balanced shareholder capital return with investment into the business.","Kroger is the leading American grocer, with 2,719 supermarkets operating under several banners throughout the country at the end of fiscal 2022. Around 83% of stores have pharmacies, while nearly 60% also sell fuel. The company also operates roughly 120 fine jewelry stores. Kroger features a leading private-label offering and manufactures around 30% of its own-brand units (and more than 40% of its grocery own-label assortment) itself in 33 food production plants nationwide. Kroger is a top-two grocer in most of its major markets (as of early 2021, according to company data). Virtually all of Kroger's sales come from the United States. Kroger has offered to acquire no-moat Albertsons in a $25 billion deal; if the transaction is approved by regulators, it should close in 2024.","Kroger is in sound financial health, with net debt of roughly 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2022 (three-year average is 1.6 times). Management has long (and prudently) reiterated its commitment to investment-grade credit ratings, so we expect continued conservatism.We expect capital expenditures to account for nearly 3% of sales over the next 10 years (around $4 billion on average annually), directed toward omnichannel expansion rather than store growth. Despite this, free cash flow to the firm should average just below 2% of sales through our explicit forecast, sufficient to fund Krogers ongoing omnichannel transformation.Kroger has a history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases; we expect that to continue longer term. However, until the process around the proposed merger with Albertson has concluded, we view management's decision to suspended share repurchases to focus on deleveraging as prudent. Ultimately, by the end of our explicit forecast, we assume Kroger returns around 35% of cash flow generated from operations to investors via dividends and share repurchases. Kroger will also likely pursue further partnerships or, after the fate of its attempt to acquire Albertsons is known, acquisitions in order to bolster its omnichannel efforts and meet changes in the grocery landscape; however, we do not incorporate such transactions because of their uncertain timing and nature.",KR,Consumer Defensive,32081491968.0,NYQ,6246319.0,USD,43.81999969482422,True,1,45.74129414277764,47.38172827826914,1
24/11/2023,Palo Altos Dominance in Cybersecurity Extends Beyond Firewalls,Palo Alto Networks Inc,PANW,3,16/11/2023,Malik Khan,263.14,USD,23/11/2023,250.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,B,16/11/2023,"We are raising our fair value estimate to $250 from $245 for wide-moat Palo Alto Networks after the firm kicked off fiscal 2024 with strong financial results including better-than-expected profitability. While competitors like Fortinet have seen forward-looking metrics affected by a downturn in customer spending on hardware appliances, Palo Altos pivot away from hardware firewalls continues to insulate the business financials and metrics. As part of this pivot, Palo Alto has built security solutions that serve a wide range of customer needs. In a period when customer spending on hardware firewalls is strained, Palo Altos non-firewall security platforms have enabled the firm to maintain a robust business pipeline and produce strong financial results. With shares trading down about 6% afterhours, we believe investors got spooked by Palo Alto reducing its fiscal 2024 billings guidance by $200 million to $10.75 billion at the midpoint of the guidance range. We dont ascribe this reduced guidance as a sign that deals are slipping or that customers are being extremely conservative with their spending with Palo Alto. Rather, we think Palo Alto is encouraging its customers to sign annual deals, which carry a lower billing amount than multiyear ones, instead. This would be an issue if these customers were free after one year, but thanks to high switching costs on these solutions, we think this is a low likelihood and were not overly concerned about the lower billings. Wed also point investors to other forward-looking metrics, such as remaining performance obligations, or RPO, as better guides of Palo Altos overall business health. Palo Altos sales for the first quarter came in at $1.88 billion, up 20% year over year and roughly in line with our prior expectations. Once again, Palo Altos next-generation security portfolio posted robust growth.","Palo Alto has strong secular tailwinds behind its back as endpoint security, cloud security, and the convergence of networking and security are projected to grow rapidly. Palo Altos strength in the high-margin firewall space should allow the firm to generate substantial cash in the future. The company stands to benefit as clients consolidate vendors and opt for a platform-based cybersecurity approach.","Large public cloud vendors often offer their own cybersecurity solutions, which could hamper Palo Altos growth opportunities. Palo Altos competitors also utilize a platform approach, thereby entrenching them in their clients ecosystems and making them harder to displace. There always remains a risk that Palo Alto may miss out on the next big technology, thereby allowing its competitors to catch up.",16/11/2023,"We view Palo Alto Networks as a leader in multiple cybersecurity end markets, including network security, cloud security, and security operations. We believe the firm stands to materially benefit from secular tailwinds across its three key verticals as cloud migrations, shift to zero-trust security, and increased automation in cybersecurity increases Palo Altos value proposition to its clients. In our view, the firms sticky platforms, combined with a broad range of cybersecurity applications have helped Palo Alto build a wide economic moat around its business. The cybersecurity segment continues to increase in threat complexity and intensity. A typical enterprises digital footprint has exponentially increased over the years leading to the creation of new attack vectors that nefarious players can exploit. The number of attack vectors has increased, as has the damage from cybersecurity lapses with companies facing punitive regulatory fines along with reputational and commercial damage.  In this evolving landscape, we see IT security teams looking for platforms that offer more holistic security coverage versus point solutions that can inadvertently create data silos. This shift toward consolidation is an opportunity for platform cybersecurity vendors such as Palo Alto. By providing a broad range of cybersecurity solutions under the same platform, Palo Alto can alleviate the toolset management burden for its clients. At the same time, Palo Alto can upsell its customers other modules within the same platform or cross-sell them additional platforms.  We are encouraged by Palo Altos ability to attract customers and expand its customer base. After onboarding a customer, we typically see a consistent movement along the upselling schedule with customers adopting more Palo Alto modules or buying additional platforms. This upselling/cross-selling also leads to greater entrenchment within a clients IT ecosystem and a higher client lifetime value. ","We assign Palo Alto Networks a wide moat rating owing primarily to strong customer switching costs, and second to a network effect associated with its offerings. We view Palo Alto as a leader in multiple categories spanning network security, cloud security, and security operations. Palo Altos three platforms, spanning the three verticals mentioned above, have resonated exceptionally well in the enterprise market, with the firm selling into all the Fortune 100 and more than three fourths of the Global 2000 firms. The firms platform approach to cybersecurity has also enabled it to grow its wallet share among existing clients while adding new ones at a fast clip. We expect this dominance to persist, and we expect Palo Altos land-and-expand model to allow the firm to gain operating leverage and produce excess returns for the foreseeable future. Palo Alto offers its clients three platforms: Strata, Prisma, and Cortex. Strata is the firms network security offering that helps secure a clients network via next-generation firewalls. Prisma is Palo Altos cloud security platform that focuses on securing processes running on the cloud. Cortex, the latest of Palo Altos platforms, is geared toward security operations and includes endpoint security and automated security responses, among other modules. Put together, Palo Altos platforms enable it to cover multiple attack vectors spanning critical areas of a modern enterprise. From a clients perspective, having one vendor managing key parts of its cybersecurity helps to alleviate challenges associated with having disparate security solutions for various parts of the overall IT stack. When examining the competitive dynamics of the three verticals Palo Alto operates in, we view all three as conducive to the presence of economic moats as enterprise spending in these spaces is sticky with significant risks and upheaval required to switch away from existing vendors. As we look at the broader cybersecurity space, we believe the complexity and intensity of threats are ever-increasing. As enterprises continue to adopt SaaS solutions, undergo digital transformations, and migrate to the cloud, we see the number of attack vectors (or entry points for nefarious players) growing rapidly. A modern enterprise has to maintain robust security while maintaining resources on the cloud and on-premises. To further magnify the complexity, we suspect that most enterprises will adopt a hybrid model with employees working remotely for at least a couple of days a weekthereby strengthening the need for securing workforces beyond the office. The intensity of digital threats is also on the rise, with higher costs of a data breach, including punitive fines for any customer data theft.As a result of this dramatic shift in how enterprises run, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic, there has been a similarly dramatic increase in the number of software tools enterprises deploy to secure their infrastructures. However, such a sprawling toolkit comes at a costprimarily the creation of silos in which individual portions of an enterprises IT stack are secured by disparate solutions that do not work together effectively. We see this approach as untenable for the future as rising IT threat complexity and intensity will force enterprises to opt for platforms that offer to secure key cybersecurity areas. Based on various industry reports, we estimate that enterprises currently use 60-80 different security solutions, but wish to narrow that number down to 15-20 key solutions. Amid this changing landscape, we see an opportunity for platform-based cybersecurity vendors, such as Palo Alto, to help enterprises consolidate their digital footprints while maintaining a secure ecosystem. Additionally, while we do not see cybersecurity as a winner-take-all market, we believe that platform vendors stand to become dominant players as the cybersecurity vendor list shrinks for enterprises. Due to the sheer expanse of the market, estimated to be north of $130 billion, we think multiple platform vendors can carve out wide economic moats while facing competition between each other.Across our coverage, we see high switching costs for enterprise-focused cybersecurity vendors, such as Palo Alto. We believe security-related IT decisions are driven by security analysts and engineers, not accountants. Put another way, we do not think that a company will nickel-and-dime their way to picking security vendors, especially in the network security segment. Customers who adopt security solutions do so to take uncertainty off the tableswitching vendors often brings uncertainty back into play. Additionally, entrenched platform vendors, such as Palo Alto, also have an expansive footprint across an enterprise. To uproot such a vendor requires not only a competitive offering from another vendor, but often retraining staff to use the new platform, a period of increased vulnerability. As we think of Strata, Palo Altos network security platform, we see evidence of strong customer switching costs. Network security spending, of which firewalls are a significant portion, is sticky. Palo Alto has firewalls that can be deployed via hardware and software form factors. Additionally, the firm has been a pioneer in the Secure Access Service Edge segmenta novel concept regarding the convergence between networking and security. By remaining agnostic to form factor and deployment, Palo Alto is able to land customers with varying network security needs. Following initially getting customers, Palo Alto has shown excellence in upselling customers by adopting additional modules within the network security platform. This upselling not only contributes to Palo Altos top-line growth, but also expands the firms presence within its clients enterprise, which in turn entrenches Palo Alto further into a clients security apparatus and makes churn less likely.A similar argument for high customer switching costs can be constructed for Prisma and Cortex, Palo Altos cloud security and security operations platforms. Across both platforms, we have seen strong upselling and cross-selling activity by Palo Alto, with more than half of the Global 2000 firms adopting all three platforms. With increased adoption of the more nascent Prisma and Cortex platforms, we expect Palo Alto to continually expand its footprint in its clients security systems.Along with high switching costs, we believe a network effect reinforces Palo Altos wide moat. Cybersecurity, in its essence, is a data problem, as nefarious activity is data streaming into an enterprises ecosystem and latching onto, and exploiting, valuable resources. With the exponential increase in data, we are past the point of manual intervention in cybersecurity to detect, prevent, or mitigate a cyberattack. As a result, cybersecurity vendors have invested a great deal of capital and talent into developing AI solutions to automate processes and pick up threats (especially never-seen-before, zero-day attacks). However, artificial intelligence and ML solutions are only as good as the data that is fed to them. This need for good-quality data is where we see entrenched platform vendors, such as Palo Alto, having an edge as they have data streaming into their security solutions from across the enterprise. By collecting and analyzing this rich data coming into its platforms, a platform vendor such as Palo Alto can uncover threats and new threat signatures that can then be used to update its entire client bases security posture. As more data comes in, Palo Altos platforms become better at detecting and mitigating cyber threats. As a result, more customers join Palo Altos platforms due to superior productswhich, in turn, leads to more data, and the flywheel spins faster. We see this network effect as reinforcing switching costs as wellwith customers hesitant to leave Palo Alto as itd entail losing the latest threat updates essential to maintaining a secure IT infrastructure.All in all, as we look at Palo Altos business as a whole, we see an entrenched platform vendor with sticky products, impressive enterprise penetration, and a long runway for growth. We believe that Palo Alto has built a powerful economic moat around its business, consisting of high customer switching costs bolstered by a powerful network effect. With that in mind, we believe that Palo Alto will continue to generate excess returns over the long term.","We assign Palo Alto Networks a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating due to the firm competing in the ever-shifting cybersecurity segment. While we commend Palo Altos efforts to insulate itself from obsolescence by investing in emerging technologies and security infrastructures, the cybersecurity segment is known for its rapid pace of development. With this in mind, large cybersecurity vendors such as Palo Alto stand to be disrupted by smaller upstarts that could outperform Palo Alto in key modules across its three verticals. To stay ahead, Palo Alto has to constantly invest in technologies that the firm predicts will be needed. However, an inaccurate assessment of future customer demand could lead Palo Alto to either overpay in an acquisition or overspend to develop the same technology in-house. Much like other software firms, Palo Alto invests heavily in its sales and research departments. Due to the high spending in these verticals, the firm is yet to achieve consistent GAAP profitability, with 2023 marking the first time in over a decade that the firm hit GAAP profitability. While we firmly believe in Palo Altos long-term opportunities, including its ability to maintain GAAP profitability over the long term, we think that to bask in the light at the end of the tunnel, Palo Alto will have to execute well in the coming years.Regarding environmental, social, and governance risks, we do not foresee any material ESG issues. However, notable potential risks include attracting and retaining talent, which could demand high remuneration amid a talent shortage in cybersecurity. Also, Palo Altos solutions are tasked with protecting customers from cyberattacks, making data privacy and security a key concern.","We assign Palo Alto an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on its sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.CTO Nir Zuk helped create Palo Alto Networks in 2005; his background includes Check Point Software Technologies and NetScreen Technologies. Nikesh Arora became CEO in 2018 after roles of president and COO of SoftBank Group and a few leadership positions at Google.We think Palo Altos balance sheet is in good shape. With a strong cash and liquid investments reserve and positive cash flow margins, we are not overly concerned by the firm's use of debt. Further, we think that the stickiness of the firm's product portfolio reduces downside risk during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.Palo Altos investment strategy has been stellar over the last few years. The firms investments in cloud security and security operations have allowed it to build out two platforms, Prisma and Cortex. Both platforms are showing great strength as the firm is able to onboard new customers while upselling existing ones. At the same time, the firm has invested a great deal in its own capabilities and has organically developed key modules across its three platforms. Overall, we believe these investments have enabled Palo Alto to successfully expand its horizons beyond its core network security market. Since Palo Alto has been aggressively expanding its business, the company does not pay its shareholders a dividend and has no plans on starting one soon. We see this strategy as appropriate given the firms potential growth prospects across network security, cloud security, and security operations.","Palo Alto Networks is a platform-based cybersecurity vendor with product offerings covering network security, cloud security, and security operations. The California-based firm has more than 85,000 customers across the world, including more than three fourths of the Global 2000. ","We view Palo Altos financial position as healthy. The firm ended fiscal 2023 with around $2.4 billion in cash and liquid investments. While Palo Alto does carry debt of around $2.0 billion on its balance sheet, we believe that the firms cash reserves coupled with its ability to generate healthy cash flow from its business will be sufficient to cover its commitments over our explicit forecast.With the firm reporting GAAP profitability in fiscal 2023, we believe Palo Altos GAAP operating margins will remain in the black as it increases its operating leverage by toning down some of its research and sales expenditures as a percent of sales while scaling up its business. Coupled with strong GAAP margins, the firm continues to post strong free cash flow/equity margins, which have been in the black since the firms IPO.In the future, we do not expect to see a material change in Palo Altos capital structure. In a tight macroeconomic environment, we expect the firm to raise capital by issuing more equity.",PANW,Technology,93382508544.0,NMS,6156816.0,USD,263.1400146484375,True,0,240.39705882352595,311.137528030968,1
25/11/2023,Watsco Continues to Outperform the Broader HVAC Market,Watsco Inc,WSO,2,19/10/2023,Brian Bernard,395.23,USD,24/11/2023,264.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,A,19/10/2023,"According to the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, year-to-date (through August) shipments of air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces were 16% lower than last year. Nevertheless, we think Watsco is on pace for flattish year-over-year revenue growth this year due to favorable price and product mix, and to a much lesser extent, revenue contribution from the September acquisition of Gateway Supply Company, with $180 million of annual sales. Third-quarter revenue increased 4% year over year to $2.1 billion; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment sales (70% of total sales) grew 6% and commercial refrigeration equipment sales (4% of total sales) grew 9%, but higher-margin HVAC products sales (26% of total sales) fell 3% year over year. Watscos third-quarter gross profit margin narrowed 40 basis points year over year and 140 basis points sequentially to 26.7%, which is also below managements 27% near- to mid-term target. We believe sales mix (less higher-margin HVAC product revenue and more commercial HVAC revenue) and price deflation for commodity products, such as refrigerant, copper tubing, and sheet metal (6% of sales), were primary factors behind Watscos lower gross margin. Nevertheless, disciplined selling, general, and administrative expense management drove operating margin expansion. Indeed, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12.1%. We continue to be impressed with Watscos operational execution and capital allocation. Weve raised our fair value estimate 7% to $264 per share, due to modest upward adjustments to our five-year revenue growth and profit margin outlook, along with the time value of money since our last update. Even so, we continue to believe Watscos stock is overvalued. In our view, the market has bought into managements aspirational margin targets (that is 30% gross margin and 15% operating margin goal), but we remain skeptical.","Watsco will continue to effectively employ its ""buy and build"" strategy to consolidate the HVAC distribution market and compound cash flow.  Watsco serves end markets with attractive long-term growth prospects driven by an undersupplied U.S. housing stock, structurally higher R&R spending, and favorable regulatory changes (for example, energy efficiency standards).  Watsco's investments in digital technology have differentiated the firm from its competition and could support stronger customer retention rates and more robust profit margins. ","Watsco's revenue growth could slow amid a maturing residential HVAC replacement cycle.  Watsco's pricing power will likely normalize as HVAC demand moderates and inflation eases, ushering in lower profit margins compared with record profitability achieved in fiscal 2021 and 2022. Watsco has significant supplier concentration risk, with Carrier and Rheem accounting for approximately 60% and 10% of the firm's purchases, respectively. ",19/10/2023,"Watsco is the largest player in the fragmented heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration distribution industry with a mid- to high-teens percentage market share. The company mostly operates in the United States (about 90% of sales) with an outsize presence in the Sunbelt states. Since entering the HVACR distribution market in 1989, Watsco has operated a buy and build strategy and has completed nearly 70 acquisitions that have expanded the company's geographic footprint and product assortment. Watsco's acquisition strategy has primarily targeted smaller family-owned businesses. The firm also operates three joint venture partnerships with narrow-moat-rated HVAC manufacturer Carrier. These JVs account for approximately 60% of consolidated revenue, and the relationship grants Watsco exclusive distribution rights for Carrier products across select regions of the U.S.  According to the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, shipments of air-conditioners and furnaces in the U.S. have grown at over a 5% compound annual rate since the 2009 housing crisis trough. Over the same period, Watsco increased its top line at about an 11% CAGR, driven by about 6% average same-store sales growth and 5% average growth from acquisitions (including the formation of Carrier JVs).  Residential HVAC demand (along with repair and remodel spending) soared during the pandemic, driven by more time spent at home and increased discretionary income. Strong pricing power for HVAC manufacturers and distributors accompanied the robust demand environment. Fiscal 2021 and 2022 were excellent years for Watsco with about a 20% two-year revenue growth rate and record operating margin (10% in 2021 and 11.5% in 2022 compared with the 8% 10-year average). However, we don't think this performance is maintainable over the long run. Despite upcoming regulatory tailwinds, we expect to see only modest HVAC shipment growth over the next 10 years (using 2022 as the base year) due to a maturing replacement cycle and a near-term slowdown in residential construction. Nevertheless, we expect Watsco will continue to execute its buy and build strategy to outperform market growth.","We assign Watsco a narrow moat rating because we believe the firm's exclusive distribution rights (an intangible asset) and economies of scale are durable competitive advantages that should continue to support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. Since 1996, Watsco's average ROIC (including goodwill) has averaged about 13%, and since the formation of its first Carrier JV, the firm's ROIC (including goodwill) has averaged 15%. We believe these competitive advantages also explain Watsco's stronger profit margins relative to smaller distributors. Average small- to medium-sized HVAC distributors typically earn low- to mid-single-digit margins, while Watsco's operating margin has consistently been around 8% over the last decade but improved to 10% in 2021 and 11.5% in 2022 amid booming HVAC demand and unprecedented industry pricing power. We believe Watsco enjoys an intangible asset moat source stemming from its perpetual, exclusive right to distribute Carrier products in 30 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Carrier's residential and light commercial HVAC products have leading market share in the U.S. and command a price premium. The U.S. residential HVAC original equipment manufacturing market is rather consolidated with seven firmsCarrier, Goodman (Daikin), Rheem, Trane, York (Johnson Controls), Lennox, and Nortekaccounting for 90% of U.S. HVAC shipments. Yet, the HVAC OEM market is still competitive, and pricing power accrues to firms that enjoy strong brand familiarity and quality ratings. On that front, Carrier is a top performer. Based on industry data weve seen, the average price of Carrier-branded residential central air conditioning units and equipment can be over 30% higher than the industry average.Carrier is Watsco's largest supplier, accounting for about 60% of Watsco's purchases and revenue. For comparison's sake, Rheem is Watsco's next largest supplier, accounting for less than 10% of purchases. We roughly estimate that at least 50% of Carrier's residential and light commercial HVAC products are distributed through Watsco. Russell Sigler is Carrier's second largest distributor with a stronghold on the West Coast (Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada). Watsco has approximately 38% minority ownership stake in the distributor, while the Sigler family has 62% controlling interest. If the family decides to sell all or portions of their ownership stake, they must sell it to Watsco at an already-agreed-upon EBIT multiple. Exclusive distribution can be mutually beneficial to suppliers and distributors. Exclusivity results in less price competition for distributors, and suppliers have more control over marketing efforts and end market pricing. Furthermore, we believe a more concentrated independent distributor channel is more efficient for suppliers, both in terms of operating costs and working capital. Yet, some HVAC OEMs operate a company-owned distribution channel (Lennox, for example). In fact, Carrier (under United Technologies' ownership) employed this model decades ago but exited this strategy in the late 2000s to reduce Carrier's complexity and focus on higher-margin core businesses. We see no risk of Carrier reverting to a company-owned distribution model.The North American heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration distribution market is very fragmented with thousands of distributors competing in a $50 billion market. As the largest HVACR distributor with low-double-digit market share, we believe Watsco benefits from two forms of scale-driven cost advantages over the many small distributors that exist in the fragmented HVACR distribution market. First, the firm can leverage its scale to negotiate better pricing from suppliers and earn volume-based rebates and other sales incentives. Second, we believe Watsco realizes better fixed cost leverage than competitors that have much smaller revenue bases. In our view, Watsco does not have environmental, social, and governance risks that could result in material value destruction. We believe the firm's most significant ESG risk is human capital risk (that is, an inability to recruit and retain skilled talent). With a tight labor market, employee retention is crucial, especially for Watsco, which employs approximately 1,200 salespeople, averaging 14 years of HVACR industry experience. However, we think Watsco has adequately managed this risk, and we believe human capital risk is a greater challenge for some of Watsco's smaller competitors that have fewer resources to manage this risk.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Watsco is High. We think a more uncertain near-term operating environment and plausible upside and downside risk to our profit margin outlook warrant a wider margin of safety for the stock. Our Uncertainty Rating is also informed by a quantitative methodology to help calibrate our fundamentals-based assessments of uncertainty across a broad universe of stocks.Watsco primarily serves stable end markets, and its business model generates reliable free cash flow throughout the business cycle. Watsco generates approximately 65%-70% of revenue from the residential HVAC replacement market (both new equipment and parts). HVAC systems play a critical role in keeping homes safe and comfortable, so system failures are often quickly addressed. As such, HVAC replacements and repairs are less sensitive to underlying economic conditions compared with other big-ticket repair and remodel projects. For example, based on our analysis of historical U.S. R&R spending data, we found that the number of HVAC projects remained relatively stable between the R&R market peak in 2006-07 and the trough in 2008-09. While the new construction HVAC market is more cyclical than the replacement market, we estimate new construction accounts for less than 20% of Watsco's revenue. Nevertheless, an economic downturn would likely result in lower revenue and profitability for Watsco as more households choose to repair faulty HVAC systems rather than replace them and new residential and commercial construction activity slows. Since entering the HVACR distribution market in 1989, Watsco has completed nearly 70 acquisitions, and we expect acquisitions will continue to be a cornerstone of the firm's growth strategy. The success of future acquisitions is uncertain, and a variety of factors, such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance, could destroy shareholder value.","We assign Watsco an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Since 1996 (and through 2022), we calculate that Watsco has allocated approximately $3.7 billion of shareholder capital to fund dividends (66% of that $3.7 billion), net acquisitions (19%), capital expenditures (9%), and share repurchases (6%). We assess Watsco as having a sound balance sheet. Watsco has a perennially strong balance sheet as the firm has historically operated with very low financial leverage. The company generates sufficient operating cash flow to reinvest in organic growth opportunities and acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. As such, we expect management will continue to operate with a conservative balance sheet for the foreseeable future. We assess Watscos investment strategy as exemplary. In our view, management has executed well on its buy and build strategy, delivering 8% average revenue growth and a 17% average ROIC over the previous decade. Acquisitions are a cornerstone of Watsco's growth strategy, and, in our view, management has maintained a disciplined acquisition framework. The firm's acquisitions have mostly stayed within its core HVACR distribution model with clear strategic merit (for example, geographic or product expansion). Furthermore, we think management's adverseness to debt reduces the likelihood that the firm would grossly overpay for a large acquisition. The HVAC distribution industry remains fragmented, and we expect management will continue to slowly consolidate the space and employ its established acquisition playbook to deliver attractive deal ROICs. We wouldn't be surprised if Watsco will eventually target the few other notable Carrier distributors to further entrench its relationship with its largest supplier. Aside from acquisitions, management has astutely recognized the importance of melding technology with its distribution operations, and the firm has invested in building robust digital platforms aimed at improving customer experience and profitability. In our view, this technology can create a differentiated experience for Watsco customers that its smaller competitors cannot match. That said, we think much of this technology is replicable over a long enough time horizon.We assess Watscos shareholder distributions as appropriate. Watsco regularly returns cash to shareholders, primarily through dividends. Watsco's annual dividend has steadily increased from $0.10 in 1998 to $9.80 in 2023. Watsco's payout ratio has exceeded 80%, on average, over the last five years, but, in our view, the firm has also appropriately reinvested in the business.Watsco is led by a veteran executive management team. Chair and CEO Albert Nahmad took control of the company in 1972 after he acquired it from its founder, William Wagner. Nahmad's son, Aaron (A.J.) Nahmad was named president in 2016 after serving as the president of strategy and innovation (since 2010) and director of global business development (since 2005). CFO Ana Menendez has led Watsco's finance team since 2003, and executive vice president Barry Logan has served in various roles at Watsco (including CFO from 1997-2003) since 1992.","Watsco is the largest heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration products distributor in North America. The company primarily operates in the United States (91% of 2022 revenue) with significant exposure in the Sunbelt states. Watsco also has operations in Canada (5% of sales) and Latin America and the Caribbean (4% of sales). The company's customer base consists of more than 120,000 dealers and contractors that serve the replacement and new construction HVACR markets for residential and light commercial applications. ","Watsco has a perennially strong balance sheet as the firm has historically operated with very low financial leverage. While Watsco generates sufficient operating cash flow to reinvest in organic growth opportunities and acquisitions and return capital to shareholders, the firm does have an unsecured revolving credit facility that it uses to fund its capital allocation outlays. Nevertheless, Watsco's net debt/EBITDA ratio averaged less than 0.5 during the last 10 years. We expect management will continue to operate with a conservative balance sheet for the foreseeable future.

25/11/2023,Danaher Has Spun Off the Veralto Assets to Shareholders,Danaher Corp,DHR,4,24/10/2023,Julie Utterback,221.41,USD,24/11/2023,243.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,24/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Danaher turned in solid third-quarter results, as its bioprocessing business appears to be bottoming near management expectations. At first blush, we do not anticipate changing near-term expectations or our $243 fair value estimate materially, which incorporates the Veralto spinoff. Danaher's shares remain moderately undervalued. After the pandemic boom years, Danaher's results continued to reset in the third quarter with revenue down 12% on a core basis (in constant currency and organically) while adjusted EPS declined 21%. This top-line performance included significant declines in former high-flying businesses. Specifically, the new biotechnology segment, which provides bioproduction tools for drug makers and benefited from COVID-19 vaccine production in recent years, declined 21% on a core basis. This decline reflected inventory destocking, more cautious buying from emerging and established customers due to external uncertainties, and challenges in China. However, that business hit management expectations and may be in the process of finding a bottom in demand. The diagnostics segment, which benefited from COVID-19-related testing in recent years, declined 16% on a core basis, although the Cepheid business outperformed expectations. With this deleveraging on the top line, margins contracted too, which caused the EPS decline. For 2023, our expectations have not changed materially. Management expects a core revenue decline in the low double digits, which is on the weak end of its previous expectations without the Veralto assets. However, with Danaher's focus on continuous improvement, it maintained an adjusted operating margin assumption of around 29%, which is a good sign for future margin development. Also, beyond the ongoing reset and Veralto spinoff that could constrain results into 2024, we still expect Danaher to return to more normal growth patterns, including high-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit earnings growth in the long run.","The Danaher Business System focuses on continuous improvement, including the acceleration of core growth and margin expansion through marketing initiatives and innovation, which appears positive for Danaher's long-term prospects.  Danahers shift to healthcare markets has created a less cyclical business in attractive markets with high barriers to entry and impressive recurring consumables revenue streams. Danaher has plenty of opportunities to consolidate and improve performance in its targeted life science and diagnostic end markets. ","Danaher continues to hunt for acquisitions in the life sciences and diagnostics markets, which could constrain ROICs including goodwill if it makes acquisitions at unattractive prices and is not able to integrate them as successfully as in the past. Danaher faces significant competition in its target niches and must remain dedicated to ongoing innovation to remain relevant, which is not guaranteed. As the the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into an endemic situation, Danaher's growth has declined in 2023, and more challenges, such as in China, have emerged.",02/10/2023,"Through its Danaher Business System, Danaher aims for continuous improvement of its scientific technology portfolio by seeking out attractive markets and then making acquisitions to enter or expand within those fields and divest assets that are no longer seen as core, such as the recently divested Veralto operations. After acquisitions, Danaher aims to accelerate core growth at acquired companies by making research and development and marketing-related investments. It also implements lean manufacturing principles and administrative cost controls to boost operating margins. Overall, we appreciate Danaher's strategic moves, which have pushed it into attractive end markets with strong growth prospects and sticky, recurring revenue streams. Danaher's acquisition-focused strategy has contributed to it becoming a top-5 player in the highly fragmented and relatively sticky life science and diagnostic tool markets about 20 years after its first acquisition in the space (Radiometer in 2004). Recent life science and diagnostic acquisitions have included Beckman Coulter, Pall, and Cepheid. In early 2020, Danaher completed the acquisition of GE Biopharma, now called Cytiva, which fills in some gaps for Danaher within the biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing tool market. Within the life sciences field, we find that end market particularly attractive given its strong growth trajectory, high margins, and high switching costs associated with regulatory and reproducibility concerns of end users. Management has started making more acquisitions in that space, such as Aldevron, and we would expect more tuck-in acquisitions in this and other end markets. Danaher also continues to prune its portfolio of businesses. The recent divestiture of its environmental and applied solutions group (now called Veralto) is just the latest for the company that distributed shares in the now publicly traded Fortive Corp (industrials) in 2016 and Envista (dental) in 2019 directly to shareholders. More divestitures are possible in the future, as well.","We believe a narrow moat surrounds Danahers diversified set of businesses. While Danahers merger, acquisition, and divestiture activities have cut into its returns on invested capital including goodwill in recent years, our narrow moat rating recognizes the attractive fundamental qualities of its core businesses, which appear likely to sustain returns over capital costs for at least the next 10 years. Specifically, we see intangible assets and switching costs as moat sources for Danaher. Generally, the company offers differentiated technology that is protected by various intangible assets, including patents, brands, copyrights, and trademarks. Those intangible assets prevent identical copycats during a long period of time. Since even slightly differentiated technical features can cause an end user to prefer one tool over another in Danaher's precise scientific end markets, we see intangible assets around its differentiated technology. Also, once its products are chosen due to their differentiated features for a specific application, Danaher is often able to layer on substantial switching cost-related advantages. Danaher's tools enable the essential operations of its clients, and switching to a competitor's technology could change the outcome of those operations, which would be undesirable for users once Danahers products are incorporated into their work flow. Nearly 80% of Danahers revenue streams are recurring in nature, and most of those sales are considered captive, meaning customers cannot use another supplier if it wants to keep using Danahers instruments or equipment. That dynamic highlights the razor/razor blade model that Danaher pursues with its differentiated technology. However, the durability of Danahers competitive advantages differs by product set. We believe the life sciences segment enjoys the most durable competitive advantages, particularly in switching costs. The differentiated properties of Danaher's tools affect the performance, accuracy, and speed of the various research projects they enable, and those product features create intangible assets that inform decisions to use those tools in specific applications at the beginning of a research project. In order to remain relevant to scientists in early research phases, Danaher must continue to innovate, which contributes to its intangible assets in this business, as well. However once those initial decisions are made, we see a particularly sticky business in its drug development and manufacturing tools, which we estimate account for about one third of Danaher's business after the recent Veralto divestiture. With those products, Danaher serves biopharmaceutical firms from the discovery of a new molecule through the production of that medicine. Once Danahers products are chosen by the end user as part of the production process of a molecule at the beginning of the clinical trial process, the client is unlikely to switch suppliers for that tool due to regulatory and reproducibility factors. Additionally, if that molecule is successfully marketed, the revenue stream would likely continue through the products life cycle. From discovery to patent expiration, Danaher could generate recurring revenue for at least 20 years on a small molecule and even longer if the generic manufacturer chooses to use the same manufacturing methods for difficult-to-manufacture biologics that have life cycles beyond their patent expiration. That durability bodes well for the economic profitabilty in this business. In the rest of the firm's life science operations, we see a narrower moat in these generally shorter projects. However, concerns about reproducibility in the customers test results during the course of a research project can create some inertia to switch from those technologies during that period, too.In diagnostics, Danaher provides a broad set of tools--including clinical chemistry, immunoassays, hematology, tissue-based, and molecular diagnostics--which it sells primarily to hospitals, physician offices, and reference labs for use on patients blood, urine, or tissue samples. Economic moats in this business are derived from a mix of intangible assets and switching costs. Getting a diagnostic system placed in a lab initially relates to the differentiated features of Danahers proprietary technology, which contributes to the intangible assets moat source of this segment. However, once placed and in regular use, we see some switching cost advantages in Danahers diagnostic tools. Specifically, displacing the use of an established diagnostic platform can be challenging for competitors since labs are hesitant to disrupt systems that are integrated into their workflows, and pathologists can be particularly loyal influencers on diagnostic platforms. So even when a test is relatively simple scientifically, customers often show loyalty to tools that make their work-life easier through high automation and a broad set of test options. We would also note that diagnostic segments sales represent the highest percentage of recurring revenues of Danaher's segments. We do not see any major ESG risks at Danaher that would cut into its economic profitability at this time.","While Danaher's current business mix generates relatively stable results, uncertainty around demand for its toolsespecially in the currently challenging environmentand the firm's acquisition-focused strategy creates Medium uncertainty around future cash flows. On an underlying basis, the company's products should generate predictable revenue streams. In life sciences, demand for Danaher's products is largely influenced by the health of biopharmaceutical and academic research and development budgets, which are largely uncorrelated to economic cycles but have been challenged in this postpandemic environment. In diagnostics, Danaher sells systems and related consumables into hospital and other labs. While laboratory capital budgets can fall prey to economic cycles, we are comforted that this business relies much more on recurring sales than one-time system sales.Danaher's acquisition strategy also creates some uncertainty for shareholders. These activities create integration-related risks, although Danaher usually sails right through them with its Danaher Business System. Probably more importantly from an uncertainty perspective, Danaher hunts in target markets that have been richly valued in recent years, and if Danaher overpays on acquisitions, it may not be able to generate economic profits, eventually. Also, the company typically uses some debt leverage to finance these deals. If the company does not quickly deleverage after debt-funded transactions for any reason, acquisitions could eventually harm its financial flexibility. From an ESG perspective, we see limited risks for Danaher.","Our capital allocation rating on Danaher remains Exemplary and reflects our appreciation of the company's investment strategy and execution that contributes to its exceptional investment score. The company also sports a sound balance sheet and makes appropriate distributions to shareholders, in our opinion, which rounds out our view of its Exemplary capital allocation rating.We applaud Danaher's strategy and execution in the investment component of our methodology, in particular. Although acquisition-related constraints on returns on invested capital including goodwill are a mild cause for concern, we have a materially positive view of management's investment decisions from a strategic perspective. Danaher aims to invest in industries with attractive characteristics and strong brands within those industries. Importantly, the combination of Danaher's strong strategic direction and its exceptional execution enabled by the Danaher Business System suggests that the company's success with past acquisitions is repeatable. DBS focuses primarily on putting the best team on the field that will listen to customer needs, innovate to meet those needs, and continuously improve its operations; this has led to strong profit and cash flow growth, which has handsomely rewarded Danaher shareholders over the long run. Impairments have been rare for the company, which supports our view that management follows a disciplined acquisition strategy and that its excellent execution after acquiring targets is repeatable. Overall, we think its unique culture of continuous improvement sets Danaher apart from other roll-up strategies.The company's substantial acquisition appetite has inflated financial leverage at times, but we generally see its balance sheet management as sound, with medium unleveraged business risk and easily manageable debt obligations. For example, at the end of 2022, gross leverage stood around 2 times by our calculations, and debt remains a small part of the overall capital structure, with very few debt maturities that could trip up the company in the near future. Danaher has expressed a desire to maintain its investment-grade status, which we think is likely. However, the company remains highly acquisitive, and future acquisitions could significantly boost leverage from current levels, at times. In general, though, we would expect Danaher to boost debt leverage to make acquisitions, deleverage, and then do it all over again when another large acquisition target presents itself. In order to continue with its acquisition strategy while maintaining financial flexibility, Danaher does not typically repurchase shares, which we have viewed as a positive discipline, especially in the pandemic years when shares were largely overvalued, in our opinion. The company does pay a small dividend, which we think will continue to grow along with earnings. We view these activities as roughly appropriate from a shareholder distribution perspective, especially considering the firm's strategy and record on the acquisition front.Also of note, cofounding brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales retain influence over the company, which has roots in a real estate firm that was founded in 1969 but refocused in 1984 as Danaher. Steven Rales chairs the board, and Mitchell Rales chairs the board's executive committee. The brothers cumulatively owned approximately 11% of Danaher's outstanding shares as of early 2023. Tom Joyce, who had been CEO since 2014, retired in September 2020. He was succeeded by the head of the life sciences segment, Rainer Blair, a Danaher veteran. So far, we have seen a relatively smooth transition with few strategic or cultural changes. While Blair may want to put his own stamp on the organization, we suspect Danaher will continue to move toward more healthcare-focused applications through acquisitions and the recent divestiture of its nonhealthcare businessVeralto's environmental and applied solutions. We see that divestiture as merely another step forward on Danaher's path of continuous improvement.","In 1984, Danahers founders transformed a real estate organization into an industrial-focused manufacturing company. Through a series of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, Danaher now focuses primarily on manufacturing scientific instruments and consumables in two segments--life sciences and diagnostics--after the late 2023 divesititure of its environmental and applied solutions group, Veralto.","Danaher's acquisition-focused strategy makes financial flexibility and capital market access important. In recent years, the company has issued debt to make significant acquisitions, such as Beckman Coulter (2011), Pall (2015), Cepheid (2016), and Cytiva (2020) before deleveraging to more manageable levels again. At the end of 2022, gross leverage stood around 2 times by our calculations. Danaher has expressed a desire to maintain its investment-grade status, and we think that should be achievable. However, the company is highly acquisitive, and future acquisitions could significantly boost leverage from current levels before the company aims to return to more manageable levels.",DHR,Healthcare,165135400960.0,NYQ,3126656.0,USD,221.41000366210932,True,1,216.37578645594587,237.99463411657075,1
24/11/2023,Broadridge's Franchises Are Robust in the Current Environment,Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc,BR,3,02/11/2023,Rajiv Bhatia,186.7,USD,23/11/2023,190.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,A,02/11/2023,"Broadridge started its fiscal 2024 on solid footing. Revenues in the firms seasonally soft fiscal quarter of $1.43 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.09 edged out the FactSet consensus estimates of $1.39 billion and $0.97 respectively. As is often the case during first quarter earnings, Broadridge reaffirmed its fiscal-year outlook. Overall, there was little in Broadridges earnings release that would alter our long-term view of the firm, and we will maintain our fair value estimate of $190 on Broadridges shares. Broadridges steady performance amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and topsy-turvy market movement support our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low. Broadridges recurring regulatory communications grew 5%. In our view, equity position growth of 8% was healthy, though mutual fund and ETF position growth of 3% decelerated from the mid-to-high single-digit percentages seen in recent quarters. Broadridge noted that equity position growth was driven by managed accounts rather than self-directed accounts. Broadridge expects equity position growth of mid- to high-single digits and mutual fund and ETF position growth of midsingle digits for the full year. We believe a good chunk of the revenue beat was due to higher event-driven revenue, which include equity proxy activity unrelated to an annual meeting such as shareholder approval for a merger or a proxy context as well as the election of mutual fund directors. Event-driven revenue increased from $63 million in the year-ago quarter to $87 million. On the equity side, Broadridge benefited from notable corporate action activity at Johnson & Johnson. We do not expect this elevated level of activity to continue. Global technology and operations revenue grew 11% organically, driven by the strong trade growth and the inclusion of the UBS contract in the wealth management business. We understand about 30%-40% of GTO is revenue is tied to volume in some way, either directly or through tiers.","Broadridge has a dominant market share position on delivering proxies and interims to beneficial shareholders. Direct indexing and the rise of retail investing can support position growth. During the financial crisis, Broadridges equity position count was down only 2% in 2009, indicating that its business model is recession-resistant. Broadridges global technology and operations offerings are sticky, and with the move toward outsourcing, the firm should be able to grow faster than the addressable market. ","Broadridges fees are set by the NYSE Proxy Working Group, which is overseen by the SEC. A fee review could have a negative impact. In addition, asset managers continue to face fee pressures and may be more mindful of regulatory fees in Broadridge's mutual fund and ETF interim business. As Broadridge expands via acquisitions, its new businesses are in markets that are more competitive than its proxy and interim communications business. Broadridges global technology and operations segment faces modest client concentration and acquisition activity could negatively impact Broadridge.",22/09/2023,"Broadridge Financial Solutions has been the dominant proxy and interim service provider for broker/dealers for more than 20 years. Its regulated proxy and interim business is its crown jewel, and a disproportionate amount of its net income comes from its fiscal third and fourth quarter during proxy season. In addition, Broadridge generates about 30% of its fee revenue and profit from its global technology and operations segment, which provides securities processing solutions. Amid COVID-19, Broadridge has benefited from higher engagement of retail investors through higher position growth and elevated trading volume. Since its spinoff from ADP in 2007, Broadridge has streamlined its operations and expanded into adjacent markets. After years of losses in its clearing business, Broadridge sold it to Penson Worldwide in 2010. It also entered into an IT-services agreement with IBM in 2010 to increase efficiency. Expanding on its mailing, data security, and processing capabilities, Broadridge has completed numerous acquisitionsat least 25 since 2010. Notable purchases include DSTs North American customer communications business for $410 million in 2016 and RPM Technologies for $300 million in 2019. The NACC business provides print and digital communication solutions, content management, postal optimization, and fulfillment to a variety of sectors, including financial services, utilities, and healthcare. RPM provides enterprise wealth-management software solutions and services. In May 2021, Broadridge acquired Itiviti, a provider of order and execution management trading software and order routing networking and connectivity solutions, for $2.5 billion, a pricey amount in our view. During its December 2020 investor day, Broadridge laid out its three-year annual goals including recurring revenue growth of 7%-9% (organic 5%-7%), adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8%-12%. Thus far, Broadridge has largely achieved these goals.","We give Broadridge a narrow economic moat rating based on cost advantages and switching costs. The company boasts a 98% client revenue retention rate. Broadridge is the dominant player in the proxy and interim communication business. Most securities in the United States are held in the street name of brokerages rather than directly under the name of the end investor, and as a result, issuers (whether they be corporate issuers, exchange-traded funds, or mutual funds) cant directly communicate with their beneficial owners. Communication and proxy voting has to be coordinated with the broker/dealer, the issuer, and the beneficial owner; virtually all broker/dealers hire Broadridge to serve as a third-party agent to handle this role. Broadridge processes over 80% of outstanding shares.By law, issuers must reimburse broker/dealers for the costs of forwarding proxy materials. The maximum fees are set forth by the Proxy Voting Review Committee, a self-regulating organization with oversight from the SEC. Because there is no incentive to charge below the maximum fees, in practice the maximum fees are the fees charged to issuers and some of the revenue is shared with the broker/dealer. We believe switching costs arise from Broadridges multiyear contracts and client inertia. We also believe that Broadridges corporate issuer clients view proxy fees as a cost of being public, as it is relatively immaterial to their bottom line. For example, McDonalds disclosed that it has about 2 million beneficial owners; at Broadridges average of approximately $1 per delivery, this becomes $2 million in fee expenses for McDonalds. Likewise, we believe micro- or small-cap companies have only a fraction of the shareholders, so they face fees of $20,000-$50,000. Therefore, we dont expect corporate issuers to spend much time or money lobbying to have proxy delivery fees reduced.If there is one area of greater risk, it would be in the mutual fund interim business, where clients are more concentrated and more concerned with their expenses. In recent years, mutual fund companies have lobbied to reduce the amount of their paper/mailing costs. After failing to do so in 2016 due in part to the paper lobby, the SEC in mid-2018 allowed for notice and access as a default option for mutual fund semiannual and annual reports. The rule, known as 30e-3, went into effect in January 2021. With this rule, Broadridge can collect an additional $0.05-$0.25 in notice and access fees per position on mailed deliveries but not on electronic (suppressed) deliveries as is the case with equity proxies. In the coming years, these notice and access fees on fund interims will likely disappear as Rule 498B goes into effect, which will replace long-form reports with tailored reports.Through its proxy and interim communication business, Broadridge has developed mailing, technology, and processing capabilities and has leveraged this to other offerings. For example, Broadridge provides customer communications and fulfillment services to its broker/dealer clients. An example would be mailing out trade confirmations or supplementary prospectuses. Broadridge has also acquired and developed various niche adjacent services for broker/dealers, wealth managers, and corporations. It has completed various tuck-in acquisitions to boost its capabilities and in June 2016 acquired the North American customer communications business of DST Systems for $410 million. Overall, we believe these have a narrow moat based on switching costs from client inertia and the time and resources to find a new solution.Broadridges global technology and operations segment provides securities processing solutions for capital markets, wealth management, and asset firms. Broadridge provides solutions that automate the securities transaction lifecycle, including data aggregation, performance reporting, cash management, reconciliation, and other services. Broadridge process over $7 trillion in equity and fixed-income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities. We believe Broadridge primarily competes with in-house solutions and Sungard. The biggest risk, in our view, would be customer losses due to mergers and acquisitions. After the 2005 merger of TD Waterhouse and Ameritrade, Broadridge lost TD Waterhouse as a client because Ameritrade completed its securities processing in-house. We believe that, like other business process outsourcing companies, switching costs stem from process disruption and the time and resources needed to implement a new solution. Given Broadridges dominant market share, we believe there is a reasonable case for a wide moat rating. However, we expect the percentage of Broadridges profit from the proxy and interim business to decrease over time because of M&A. In addition, though there are no fee reviews that we are aware of on the horizon, theres always the possibility that in a fee review, Broadridge could be negatively affected.","We assign a Low Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Broadridge.In our view, the biggest risk to near-term revenue and profits is equity proxy position and mutual fund interim growth. During the financial crisis, the number of equity proxy positions was down only 2% (for year ended June 30, 2009). Given the recurring nature of the equity proxy and mutual fund interim business, we believe Broadridges business is relatively recession-resistant. Given the regulated nature of proxy and interim communications, the fees that Broadridge can charge issuers on behalf of its broker/dealer clients is overseen by the NYSE Proxy Working Group. The last fee review went into effect in January 2014, with a very modest impact on Broadridge. Though Broadridge has historically fared well in fee reviews, it could be negatively affected in a future review. Broadridge has modest client concentration. On a firmwide basis, the largest client accounts for 7% of revenue. In global technology and operations, the firms largest 15 clients account historically accounted for about half of segment revenue. Broadridge generally works with its largest clients across multiple segments. From a geographic perspective, Broadridge generates about 87% of its revenue in the United States. From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we don't see a lot of risk arising from Broadridges business model. Broadridges software and solutions service millions of users, and as a result the firm must maintain strong product governance and data security.","In our view, Broadridge merits a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. We view the companys balance sheet as sound, capital investment decisions as fair, and capital returns strategy as appropriate.Broadridges leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2023 was 2.4 times, a downtick from the prior year that saw elevated leverage relative to historical levels due to the purchase of Itiviti. We believe Broadridge's leverage ratio is appropriate considering its recurring revenue business model.We believe the firms capital investment decisions are fair. Broadridges acquisition history is mixed. One notable failure was in 2005, when Broadridge was part of ADP. It purchased Bank of Americas U.S. clearing and broker/dealer services business for $344 million and sold it for less than $40 million in 2010. We believe the acquisition of DSTs North American customer communications for $410 million was made an attractive price at 10 times EBIT. Broadridges other acquisitions are hard to evaluate, given the size and limited financial disclosure, but we believe they make strategic sense. Though we view the acquisition of Itiviti as pricey, we believe the strategic rationale is reasonable. Were generally pleased with the internal growth of the global technology and operations segment. Broadridge aims for a dividend payout ratio of 40%-50%, with the remainder spent on share repurchases and acquisitions. We believe the dividend payout ratio is appropriate, given the low macroeconomic sensitivity of the firms business model. From its spinoff in 2007 to January 2019, Broadridge was led by Rich Daly, who now serves as chair. Daly built Broadridge from a small back-office outsourcer into a highly successful governance communications and capital markets solutions franchise. Current CEO Tim Gokey served as Broadridges president during 2017-19 and chief operating officer during 2012-19. Overall, were pleased with the progress Gokey has made in increasing closed sales.","Broadridge Financial Solutions, which was spun off from ADP in 2007, is a leading provider of investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker/dealers, asset managers, wealth managers, and corporate issuers. Broadridge is composed of two segments: investor communication solutions, or ICS, and global technology and operations, or GTO.","Broadridges financial health is sound, in our view. As of June 30, 2023, Broadridge had debt of approximately $3.4 billion, putting gross debt/adjusted EBITDA at about 2.4 times. We're not concerned about the firm's leverage, given the firm's resilient business model. Of the $4.2 billion in fee revenue that Broadridge generated in fiscal 2023, over 90% was classified as recurring. Also, during the last financial crisis, equity proxy position count was flat to slightly negative and mutual fund/exchange-traded fund positions grew.",BR,Technology,22988222464.0,NYQ,531640.0,USD,186.6999969482422,True,0,179.19505938361883,199.53592634789626,1
25/11/2023,Oracles Narrow Moat Is in a Query Quandary,Oracle Corp,ORCL,1,22/09/2023,Julie Sharma,116.24,USD,23/11/2023,76.0,Medium,Narrow,Poor,B,22/09/2023,"Oracle hosted its analyst day today, reiterating its fiscal 2026 non-GAAP targets given last year and highlighting where specific opportunities liestressing cloud applications and infrastructure in particular. We think Oracles profitability and EPS goals for three years from now are realistic, well-justified, and even slightly conservative. Nonetheless, we think revenue projections will be shy of targets even as we dont deny ample opportunity, but we do question Oracles ability to win rates in the face of such opportunity while operating in a heated competitive environment. As a result, we believe Oracle shares are overvalued given our fair value estimate of $76 per share for the narrow-moat firm, which we continue to believe is undergoing switching cost vulnerability amid cloud migrations. Oracles reiterated fiscal 2026 targets included $65 billion in total organic revenue, a 45% non-GAAP operating margin, and 10% plus annual non-GAAP EPS growth. We forecast Oracles fiscal 2026 total revenue (including organic and inorganic) to be $63.6 billion as we bake in non-GAAP operating margins of 47.7% and 10%-plus annual non-GAAP EPS growth. Behind Oracle managements confidence in organic revenue targets is an estimated $117-billion-dollar total applications cloud addressable market and a $253-billion total infrastructure cloud addressable market. We think the sizing of such opportunity is fairespecially considering that as of fiscal 2023 only 10% of Oracle application support customers have moved to Oracle cloud applications and only 2% of Oracle infrastructure support customers have fully moved to Oracles infrastructure cloud. However, converting these hefty bases of existing Oracle customers is a risk, in our view, as we believe that switching costs are less powerful amid cloud migrations as the headaches of lifting and shifting systems to the cloud exist even when sticking with the same vendor, which gives way to rethinking best-fit vendors.","Oracles relational database should be able to post strong growth as customers continue to depend on its quality features, such as data partitioning which brings incomparable load balancing efficiency.  Oracles autonomous database and IaaS was built with ease of use in mind, which could bring a significant base of first-time Oracle users to the company, strengthening top line results. Oracles stake in TikTok Global and cloud services to TikToks U.S. operations should add a significant boost to Oracles top line and attract more general use cloud customers.","Oracle could suffer below average growth as customers are prompted to change databases and software providers in their transition to the cloud. Oracles cloud business could struggle to win business as alternative SaaS and database systems leave little incentive to select Oracle IaaS. COVID-19 could accelerate Oracle customers digital transformation efforts, thus causing Oracle to lose customers at a faster pace than expected.",13/06/2023,"Oracle is a best-in-breed provider of on-premises relational database technologies and enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software and is one of the most profitable companies in the software industry. However, growth has been lacking as more customers shift their workloads to the cloud, bypassing Oracles solutions. Despite Oracles cloud migration efforts, cloud competition will likely provide headwinds for Oracle. In turn, our moat rating for Oracle is narrow, coupled with a negative moat trend rating. Oracles business is centered around its relational database which stores a treasure trove of data that is the lifeblood of many enterprises. Oracles software offerings leverage this database as its backend, while Oracles servicing and hardware businesses support these database tasks. Oracle remains a best-of-breed provider of on-premises databases and software, and customers face very high switching costs if they look to migrate elsewhere. However, we dont view the company as being on the forefront of recent software trends, and new and potential customers appear to be looking past Oracle for their database needs. Database preferences are far wider today due to the sheer number of ways to manipulate data, and the different data storage practices this necessitates. In turn, Oracle is losing database market share to new database types that may be better suited to the cloud. Additionally, the transition to the cloud is prompting enterprises to change software vendors away from all-in-one ERP systems to application specific that are best of breed. In response, Oracle is banking on its second-generation cloud to not only cater to its traditional enterprise workloads, like supporting databases, but also general use workloads. However, we view Oracles cloud as sub-scale to Amazon and others and we doubt Oracle can close this gap soon. In our opinion, Oracle should still be successful in moving a healthy amount of its traditional on-premises workloads to Oracle cloud. However, migrating all of its customers is not such a sure thing, as cloud-first software vendors have been able to take meaningful share from legacy Oracle customers. ","We assign Oracle a narrow moat rating based on the switching costs permeating its business. Although Oracle is an industry leading software provider today, the company is encountering headwinds as it transitions to the cloud. In turn, we foresee less certainty about the companys ability to retain its customers and generate excess returns on capital in the long run, which prevents us from assigning the firm with a wide moat rating. Oracle is by and large known for its relational database, Oracle Database. While Oracle offers both on-premises database licenses as well as its autonomous database via infrastructure-as-a-service, both forms display significant switching costs, in our view. More than ever, enterprises rely on data significantly to be the backbone of their business internally and through their products. Therefore, how such data is stored and accessed becomes a critical activity of an enterprise. Changing these storage and access methods of sensitive and highly mission critical data creates numerous headaches that arent dissimilar to switching costs we see in enterprise software, such as a significant learning curve in using new databases, or significant monetary and time-related costs associated with rewiring how a company stores and accesses data. One can imagine the disaster that would occur if salary data was accidentally stored in database cells where employees emails should be stored because of a faulty migration to a competing database. The result could be salaries accidentally published across an entire organization. An example of the stickiness of database technologies can be found in one of Oracles biggest competitors. Amazon provided the most recent example of the execution risks in attempting to migrate off Oracle databases. It was not until 2019 when Amazon Web Services stopped running on Oracle databases (other than for third-party applications), even though Amazon has offered its own database technology on Amazon Web Services since 2008. On Amazon Prime Day in June 2018, one of Amazons warehouses experienced an outage, causing 15,000 packages to have shipping delays. An Amazon internal report said that Oracles software would have handled the issue more efficiently.Apart from its database, Oracle offers a robust array of enterprise software, such as its enterprise resource planning, or ERP, supply chain management, or SCM, and human capital management, or HCM, platforms. We think all of Oracles major software offerings exhibit switching costs, which are found in many enterprise software offerings for a variety of reasons. The most obvious is the direct time and expense of implementing a new software package for a customer while maintaining an existing platform. There are indirect costs along those same lines, mainly lost productivity as customers move up a learning curve on the new system along with the distraction of users involved in the function where the change is occurring. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is the operational risk, including loss of data during the changeover, project execution, and potential operational disruption. The more critical the function and the more touch points across an organization a software vendor has, the higher the switching costs will be. We think that these same switching costs apply to Oracles NetSuite application, but just to a lesser degree. NetSuite is an ERP software geared toward small- to medium-size businesses. Because of the solutions target market, we think theres inevitably more churn in the product than Oracles other software solutions--due to the higher risks of such companies going out of business. However, we estimate it only makes up about 6% of cloud services and license support revenue.We think that Oracles hardware and services business does not merit a moat. Oracles Exadata Database Machine is the heart of Oracles hardware offerings. The machine, composed of Oracle servers, storage and networking hardware, is designed to optimize the performance of the Oracle Database. Oracle Database users do not need to run the database on the Exadata Machine, however, which is one reason why we think Oracle hardware does not merit switching costs. In addition to this reason, we think it is much easier to copy databases to different hardware than it is to change the way an enterprise structures and calls its data. These Exadata alternatives can include similar all-in-one machines tailored for running databases--like Teradata, Netezza or Greenplum. However, we suspect with growing popularity of the Oracle in-memory database, its not uncommon to use more generic servers to run the Oracle database, which could be done in competing clouds.We certainly think Oracle has its fair share of intangible assets pertaining to its database, such as its databases ability to partition data to improve load balancing. However, we do not view these as a moat source, as we think the companys switching costs are far more influential in the persistence of generating excess returns than its technological edge alone. Additionally, we think that Oracle IaaS business does not exhibit a cost advantage that contributes to the companys overall moat. IaaS companies typically benefit from economies of scale as they invest in servers and data centers. However, we believe Oracle is a sub-scale operator, relative to Amazon Web Services, or AWS, or Microsoft Azure. Similarly, IaaS is not a material contributor to Oracles profitability today. Finally, we believe that a good portion of Oracles IaaS customers are legacy Oracle on-premises customers that have migrated their workloads to Oracles cloud. We wouldnt attribute this migration to a cost advantage in Oracles cloud, but rather to Oracles ability to more seamlessly migrate its own customers to the cloud and the high switching costs associated with Oracles software and databases.","We assign Oracle a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. We do not foresee any material environmental, social, or governance issues on the horizon.The greatest risk for Oracle, in our view, stems from the shift to cloud computing and whether Oracle can effectively transition its client workloads from on-premises software into Oracles cloud. This transition affects every aspect of Oracles business in our view, most directly eliminating the need for any customer to buy Oracles hardware to run on-premises databases. But more importantly, if customers move to a competing cloud provider, they block themselves from the ability to use Oracle cloud-native software, Fusion, and the change to competing ERP software could instill a change in databases. In our view, Oracle is at risk of this transition, and the risk is exposed from all sides. In other words, customers could choose to leave Oracles software in order to go to best of breed cloud-first enterprise software, like Workday or Coupa. Or, they could choose to leave Oracles databases as a result of needing a more flexible database for their data needs which will need to scale in the cloud, like relational databases native to AWS or Azure. Whichever route is chosen in how a customer may leave an Oracle product, it likely leads to vulnerabilities in other Oracle products a customer may have. We think that COVID-19 poses a related risk to Oracle, in that it could accelerate enterprises digital transformation efforts, which could include changing workloads to the cloud. According to a Deloitte and Fortune survey, 77% of CEOs claim that COVID-19 accelerated their enterprises digital transformation plans.","We rate Oracles capital allocation as Poor, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, poor investments, and mixed shareholder distributions. We think Oracles balance sheet is sound based on its healthy cash cushion and manageable debt. Oracle had cash and cash equivalents of $10 billion and total debt of $90 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. We think the firms investments are poor as Oracle has had massive resources to keep up with innovation--but has failed to keep up with cloud-only peers. Furthermore, we believe Oracles shareholder distributions are mixed--as dividends and share repurchases are not diverting R&D efforts, but shares are considerably overvalued, in our view, making share repurchases an unattractive use of capital at the moment.Our capital allocation rating is informed by our review of Oracles management. Safra Catz, who has been with Oracle since 1999, has served as CEO since 2019. Catz had shared the CEO title with Mark Hurd, former Hewlett-Packard CEO, since 2014, until Hurds sudden passing in October 2019. The company has indicated it does not intend to replace Hurd as co-CEO; rather it intends to build a deep bench of executive talent beneath Catz and organize succession planning from those ranks. Founder and former CEO Larry Ellison remains active with the company, serving as chairman of the board and chief technology officer. We think that Oracles management has shown increasing conservativeness in its executive compensation. In fiscal 2020, Catz made less than $1 million in total compensation, as opposed to peers who were compensated in the $20 to $35 million range, according to Oracle, because the company did not meet its in-house goals. We think this reflects the companys pivot to tie compensation more to longer-term goals, which we view as more aligned with shareholder interests.We think that Oracle has been fair with its allocation of capital toward acquisitions and repurchases. Oracle has consistently increased its total annual dividends over the last 10 years and we think that will continue over the next five years, besides the dividend remaining flat in fiscal 2021. We like that Oracles dividend payout ratio has expanded to 42% in fiscal 2023 from 13% in fiscal 2013. We expect this ratio, however, to be cut to 32% by fiscal 2028. While we like that Oracle made good use of buybacks at the start of the global pandemic, we think that generally the company does have room to moderate the extensiveness of its buybacks to put capital to more strategic uses. ","Oracle provides database technology and enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software to enterprises around the world. Founded in 1977, Oracle pioneered the first commercial SQL-based relational database management system. Today, Oracle has 430,000 customers in 175 countries, supported by its base of 136,000 employees.","We consider Oracle to be in fair financial standing. As of fiscal 2023, Oracle had $10 billion in cash and equivalents versus $90 billion in debt. We bake in elevated costs of debt over the near future as the firm works to reissue upcoming debt in a tough environment with its relatively lesser cash base. Even with such constraints, we think Oracle will continue to focus on increasing its total annual dividends. We bake in total dividend adding up to $1.92 in fiscal 2028 from $1.28 in fiscal 2023, as the company continues to make share repurchases and acquisitions. However, we think the magnitude of acquisitions will moderate as the company comes off its buildout of its second-generation cloud product and has stressed its recent preference to build new capabilities in-house. For these reasons, we do not model any explicitly. In terms of capital expenditure, we think Oracle will spend an average of $5.2 billion per year over the next five years, as the company continues to require buildouts for its cloud operations.",ORCL,Technology,320945782784.0,NYQ,5601387.0,USD,116.23999786376952,True,0,112.39705873377882,112.24357981740495,0

Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24%, up more than 100 basis points both year over year and sequentially. We'll incorporate the firm's full financial and operating results shortly, but after this first look, we maintain our $56 fair value estimate. Strong international activity was the driving force behind SLB's third-quarter results and will remain central to the firm's performance moving forward. The Middle East was a high point, with regional revenue expanding 8% quarter over quarter and 22% year over year, by far the highest top-line growth of all SLB's geographies. The firm is on track to earn record revenues in the Middle East and Asia for fiscal 2023. SLB's Middle Eastern operations typically feature longer-term contracts and are rather diversified, featuring exposure to both oil and gas markets, onshore and offshore projects, with operations spanning multiple countries. We expect these characteristics will facilitate steady revenue streams moving forward.",SLBs routine investment in research and development have made it the leading innovator in oilfield services. The firms recent investment in digital solutions and integrated services will create value-accretive revenue streams. SLBs high exposure to non-U.S. markets will mitigate adverse effects from volatility in the oil and gas markets.,Decreased oil demand in the long run could limit SLBs growth potential over time. Failure to adequately innovate will lead to cessation of market share and thus pricing power. SLBs Asset Performance Solutions business potentially exposes the firm to higher liability risk relating to wellsite management.,31/07/2023,"SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield services provider in the world, with a product portfolio that addresses nearly every end market in the industry. The firm has developed an impressive reputation as one of the leading innovators in oilfield services. Roughly 20% of its annual revenue comes from new technology, and the efficiency gains well operators realize through SLBs services have earned the firm dominant market share in several categories, including wireline services, production testing, and logging-while-drilling.  Moving forward, SLB is targeting integrated services and digital solutions. Its Asset Performance Solutions, or APS, business allows well operators to completely outsource project management to SLB. APS increases operational efficiencies for all parties by reducing informational friction and time delays that tend to occur when contracting project stages to different service firms. The end result is reduced project costs and quicker time to production. SLBs DELFI ecosystem also represents significant opportunities for margin expansion by providing an asset-light, highly scalable software platform that improves project efficiency while augmenting SLBs already-impressive knowledge base.  The firm also aims to localize its expertise through its fit-for-basin approach. SLB intends to deepen relationships with its customers by creating solutions tailored to regional or individual customer requirements. The firm aims to develop technology with high in-country value that solidifies SLB's international market access in the long run. ","We award SLB a narrow moat due to its history of value generation, indicated by its returns on invested capital consistently exceeding its cost of capital. By our estimate, the firms returns on invested capital will remain strong over the next few years, reaching 26% by 2027. The firm boasts numerous intangible assets through its robust intellectual property, strong brand equity, and operational know-how, all of which contribute to the firms cost advantage. We see evidence of economies of scale and economies of scope through SLBs highly productive research and development, or R&D, investments, which often yield innovative solutions that can be leveraged across product lines, ultimately enhancing the value of SLBs R&D investment overall. Furthermore, the firm invests significantly more into research and development than its next largest competitors combined. This fortifies SLBs already-robust patent portfolio making it difficult for competitors to replicate solutions that exhibit comparable impact and ultimately strengthening barriers to entry in SLBs existing end markets. Management reports that roughly one quarter of annual revenue originates from new technology.The digital and integration segment has grown to become SLBs most profitable segment by far, with 2022 operating margins of 50% compared with 25% for the firm overall. The segment represented just 13% of revenue in 2022, yet it generated 29% of SLBs overall operating profits, in line with the well construction segment (which is nearly 3 times as large). Management indicates it will lead firm growth moving forward, which we expect will greatly enhance SLBs firmwide value generation. We estimate the segments 2021 returns on invested capital were around 28%, and we expect these will expand to 49% by 2026, given its asset-light nature and high-growth potential. Its DELFI software ecosystem contains data and analytics that facilitate integration across disciplines and throughout the well lifecycle. Oil and gas projects are often handled by several different service firms that each handle specific aspects of said project. Collaborating on a project through a common network can greatly reduce informational friction between service firms, ultimately improving the speed and quality of a well project and expanding well operators profitability. Databases include seismic surveys, well logs, and production recordsamong numerous other offeringsfrom around the world. Introduced in 2017, the DELFI ecosystem is still somewhat nascent, but customer adoption has been swiftSLB more than doubled its commercial user base between 2019 and 2021. We foresee similarly enthusiastic uptake over the next few years, especially as the firm continues adding capabilities that expand the breadth and depth of the systems analytics. Furthermore, system accuracy and speed will also improve as DELFI accumulates incremental data points with each new project, which we expect will attract even more users as well operators increasingly value operational optimization. No other major oilfield service firm provides a network of this magnitude at present. If the DELFI ecosystem proves to have enough of an impact that customers come to rely on its insights for operations, SLB could potentially develop switching costs over time.The other portion of the digital & integration segment involves SLBs Asset Performance Solutions, or APS, service that facilitates project integration. Through APS, well operators can outsource the management and development of an oilfield entirely to SLB. Integrated services are growing increasingly popular, since informational friction between independent oilfield service firms can lead to time delays that increase project costs. Several offshore providers, most notably TechnipFMC, are aggressively pursuing integrated projects, since theyre often more profitable to the service firms and can forge stickier client relationships. Numerous service firms, including Halliburton and Baker Hughes, are pursuing similar offerings, but we think SLBs dominance across product categories will make APS particularly attractive to well operators. Its worth noting, however, that some well operators prefer to contract multiple service firms for projects, so pricing remains competitive, implying there may be a ceiling for overall market penetration over time. Its also worth noting that SLB assumes all the risk for the projects it manages, many of which are turn-key, leaving little room for operational missteps. Were nevertheless optimistic in SLBs ability to efficiently execute on the vast majority of its projects, increasing the firms overall profitability via economies of scope and expanding its value-add to its customers.The Reservoir Performance segment is another strong business line for SLB. It features the firms wireline and well testing business lines, two areas in which SLB consistently holds dominant market share (according to data from Spears & Associates).Services provided by this segment help SLB and its customers better understand oil and gas reservoirs. Wireline logging optimizes lifetime well performance by monitoring and evaluating well construction and production over time. SLB has controlled roughly half of this market for more than a decade. It essentially maintains an oligopoly with Baker Hughes and Halliburton, which can give the firms stronger pricing power when negotiating contracts. The production testing market isnt quite as concentrated, but SLB has maintained roughly one quarter market share over the last decade, more than twice its next largest competitor.This segment historically relies on exploration activity. Though we expect overall capital spending will increase over the next few years, investment in exploration activity specifically will likely decline slightly. Rystad estimates indicate investment in exploration activity will decline by 0.4% per year through 2031, compared with roughly 2% annual growth for overall global investment. Well operators increasingly prefer maximizing productivity of their existing wells over commencing new projects. However, reservoir behavior changes throughout a wells lifetime, and it requires perpetual monitoring and evaluation to maximize hydrocarbon extraction over time. We therefore expect SLBs expertise will remain relevant even as new oil and gas projects remain below historical levels.The services provided by Reservoir Performance improve SLBs overall understanding of reservoir behavior, valuable knowledge the firm can use to develop superior products and services in its other segments. Core Laboratories employs a similar tactic, leveraging its vast reservoir description database to develop high-quality perforation products using fewer research and development resources. SLB enjoys a similar benefit, and its expertise is even more broadly applicable.The well construction segment is a key benefactor of such knowledge. The majority of this business centers around drilling equipment and services as well as cementing. Superior products and operational know-how are key in this spacedrilling rigs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per day, and any efficiency gains that can reduce the number of days to drill a well can generate significant cost savings for well operators. Service firms that drive the greatest efficiency gains are likely to win the most contracts, as a result. In our view, SLBs consistent dominance across product lines in this segment is a testament to its superior products and services. The firm has controlled roughly half the logging-while-drilling market for more than a decade, and it maintains roughly one third share in the both the directional drilling and drill bit markets. Like several other product lines, these end markets resemble oligopolies, with two or three firms controlling up to two thirds of the market, sometimes more. SLB is the clear industry leader more often than not, and given the high degree of cost sensitivity demonstrated by well operators, we dont think it would maintain that level of market share if its products werent consistently delivering efficiency gains.The production systems segment also benefits from SLBs know-how. This segment contains SLBs profitable artificial lift business, another market in which three firms hold half the market share. Well operators employ artificial lift services when seeking to maintain (and potentially increase) a producing wells recovery rate and potentially extend the asset life. Artificial lift services are often customized based on different downhole environments, providing SLB yet another opportunity to leverage its reservoir expertise for ancillary product development. Artificial lift services experience stronger demand during periods of low exploration activity when well operators must rely on their existing operations. Given the flat outlook for exploration activity, we expect artificial lift services will become an increasingly valuable product line for SLB.","We assign SLB a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. The inherent cyclicality of oil and gas markets makes SLBs key revenue sources quite volatile. Furthermore, most of SLB's revenue potential largely depends on well operators capital investment decisions, which are beyond SLBs control. The firms heavy exposure to onshore oil and gas markets could challenge its profitability potential over time, as rampant service commoditization and industry consolidation make competitive differentiation harder to maintain.Like all oilfield service firms, SLB is exposed to a range of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, issues. The anticipated decline in oil demand looms large over oil and gas firms. Service firms, already operating in a highly competitive industry, will experience a dwindling number of viable oil and gas projects, shrinking their potential revenue pool over time. As the largest oilfield services provider, we think SLB is the best positioned to capture a large share of remaining demand. Furthermore, we dont expect oil demand will peak until at least 2030, leaving ample time for SLB to expand its product offerings, if need be.At present, most of SLBs business relies on oil and gas projects, exposing the firm to liabilities associated with wellsite emissions and incidents. A wellsite incident (such as an explosion) could result in serious employee injury and environmental destruction that could subject SLB to fines and regulatory scrutiny. Such incidents also disrupt operations, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. Finally, reputational damage from a given incident could make it difficult for SLB to secure contracts in the future. The degree of liability depends on numerous factors (contract terms, the nature of the pollution, the cause of the incident, and so on) and service firms are rarely implicated, but the risk remains.","SLB earns an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The firm maintains a strong balance sheet and consistently returns significant cash back to shareholders. Annual dividend payments were $2 per share from 2015 to 2019, until the firm understandably cut distributions in 2020 and 2021 to conserve capital. Management has already increased dividends in 2022 to $0.68 per share, up from $0.50 in 2021. We expect the firm will steadily increase its distributions as profitability improves, returning to $2 by 2026. After suspending share repurchases in 2021 and 2022, management has distributed nearly $450 million to shareholders through buybacks in the first half of 2023, and is targeting total shareholder distributions of $2 billion in fiscal 2023. At the last reporting period, SLB had $3.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and $13.3 billion of debt outstanding, roughly half of which will mature over the next five years (at a cadence of roughly $1.3 billion per year).SLBs exceptional investment history is what sets it apart from other oilfield service firms, in our view. Its consistently generated shareholder value through prudent utilization of its research and development capital investment dollars to develop an impressive knowledge base thats applicable across a wide variety of products and services. Roughly 20% of revenue comes from new technology each year. When appropriate, the firm has also invested in strategic bolt-on acquisitions that augment the firms value proposition. Managements investment history is especially impressive given SLBs size and diversification, characteristics that broaden the potential for value-destructive investments. Peers havent always fared as well. Weatherford, for example, was the fourth-largest diversified oilfield services firm before it filed for bankruptcy restructuring in 2019, shedding several unsuccessful business lines shortly thereafter.We concede that SLB doesnt have a perfect investment record, evidenced by its $15 billion acquisition of Cameron in 2015 as part of an overoptimistic attempt to capitalize on expected recovery in offshore production. Moving forward, we dont expect SLB will make any particularly large acquisitions, though we see potential for software-related bolt-ons as the firm builds out its digital solutions business. Beyond that, SLB already touches nearly every part of the oilfield services market, creating a portfolio that can likely be best developed through further research and engineering investment. We note that management has refined its service portfolio, as well, divesting its pressure pumping and seismic acquisition businesses, two industries expected to prove especially challenging for value generation in coming years.","SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions. It maintains a reputation as one of the industrys leading innovators, which has earned it dominant share in numerous end markets.","SLB maintains a strong balance sheet. At the last reporting period, the firm had $3.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and $13.3 billion of debt outstanding, roughly half of which will mature over the next five years (at a cadence of $1.0 billion-$1.5 billion per year). Were confident SLB will generate sufficient cash to pay off its debt as its profitability improves over the next few years. Alternatively, we dont foresee material obstacles for the firm to refinance, should it choose to do so (average interest expense is 3%). Net debt to EBITDA was 1.5 times at the end of 2022, returning to the firm's historical average after a jump to 2.3 times in 2021. The improvement stems from both reduced debt and increased EBITDA. Debt to capital was 41%, in line with the firms prepandemic average of 39%. ",SLB,Energy,74837016576.0,NYQ,6369923.0,USD,52.59999847412109,True,1,57.67282355814237,50.56426820522195,0
24/11/2023,Mettler-Toledo Growing at Normal Pace During Reset Year for Most Life Science Peers,Mettler-Toledo International Inc,MTD,2,10/11/2023,Julie Utterback,1078.58,USD,23/11/2023,880.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,10/11/2023,"We are retaining our $880 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Mettler-Toledo as third-quarter results were about as we anticipated. Given persistent headwinds to top-line growth, including weaker demand in China and broader macroeconomic factors, which we expect to continue in the near term, we have adjusted our forecasts slightly. These changes to our assumptions were largely offset by cash flows generated since our last valuation, resulting in an unchanged fair value estimate. At current prices, the shares appear overvalued. In addition to pressure from challenging market dynamics in China, third-quarter revenue faced a tough comparable period and foreign-currency headwinds, leading to a 4% decline year over year. Slower demand in China hurt the firms lab business in particular; that business represents over half of total sales and was down 9% year over year excluding foreign-exchange effects. The hesitancy of biopharmaceutical clients amid macroeconomic uncertainty has delayed spending decisions and reduced orders at many life sciences toolmakers, and Mettler has not been immune from this pullback despite its leading position in key product markets. This was evidenced by the 4% decline in third-quarter adjusted earnings per share year over year and sequentially, as the impact of decreased revenue had a greater effect on profitability than the firms cost-cutting and pricing initiatives. For 2023, we now estimate about a 1% decline in sales and adjusted EPS. For 2024, we've lowered our revenue forecast to be roughly flat and expect adjusted EPS to grow 1%. These updates are largely in line with managements new guidance. Despite difficult near-term conditions, the firm continues its cost management and investment in innovation. In our view, these strategies as well as the return of healthy demand for the life sciences industry and improved macroeconomic conditions will help drive growth for Mettlers business over the longer term.","Despite the slow market growth of balances, Mettler has consistently produced double-digit earnings growth with its marketing and efficiency initiatives along with share repurchases. Mettler showed impressive cost discipline during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a flexible cost structure and healthy balance sheet, the company is poised to perform well post-crisis as well. Though their details remain somewhat opaque, the company's ongoing efficiency initiatives appear to be significant contributors to the firm's consistently strong results.","Mettlers large share-buyback program could be destroying shareholder value, with the firm continually adding leverage to buy back what we view as overpriced stock. Commoditized product lines and market competitiveness leave the door open for increasing competitive pressures that could limit profit growth in the future. With an emphasis on geography over end markets, Mettler's reported segment results could be difficult for an everyday investor to understand, and never-ending restructuring programs make earnings comparison with peers more challenging.",05/05/2023,"Mettler-Toledo is the global market leader in laboratory and industrial scales and balances and holds a leading position in product inspection. Apart from its majority share in laboratory balances, the company operates in competitive markets and holds an average share of about 25% across most product lines. While the competitive nature of these markets makes incremental share gains somewhat difficult, Mettler's intense focus on internal sales and marketing initiatives combined with its ongoing efficiency programs have helped the company defy trends its relatively slow-growing end markets.  Despite the modest growth expected in weighing instrumentation, Mettler has achieved steady above-market share gains and established a niche in high-end laboratory balances. Impressively, the firm has posted consistent pricing and margin gains over the past decade, even during the great financial crisis, 2015-16 industrial downturn, and COVID-19 pandemic. Tepid expected end market growth holds potential competitors at bay, in our view, given that new entrants would find it difficult to take meaningful share, and the reward for doing so would be relatively small.  We see some uncertainty from the transition of pandemic conditions to a more endemic situation, with most of the firms revenue tied to capital spending cycles. Additionally, higher inflation could limit earnings growth since Mettler may find it difficult to pass through price increases above the typical 2%-3% range. Still, the long-term outlook for the business looks healthy as the firm operates in mature, stable markets.  Emerging markets will continue to be a key area of focus for Mettler. The company aims to take advantage of the higher growth and lower manufacturing costs in Asia-Pacific, with an emphasis on China.  Mettler has taken a disciplined approach to acquisitions amid shareholder pressure about cash allocation. Given its strong cash flow, we expect the firm to consider small- to moderate-size acquisitions in the medium term, pursuing new technology primarily. ","Mettler-Toledo has dug a narrow economic moat, with a business model benefiting from low rates of customer churn, a reputation for quality products, and a particularly moaty position in balances and scales. In our view, switching costs and intangible assets are both material contributors to the firms moat. Mettler has significant diversification across geographies and end markets, with a stable laboratory business in life sciences acting as a counterweight to cyclical manufacturing exposure in the industrial end markets. We think Mettlers diversification offers some benefit from a moat perspective, as pockets of weakness in one geographic area or customer base can be offset by continued growth in other business units.There is a material level of customer stickiness in the lab segment, which accounts for 50% of total sales, and we see a moat in this business. Apart from scales and balances, Mettler also has a strong market position in analytical instruments, such as titrators, media dispensers like pipettes, and automated chemistry technologies. Mettler has a leading market position in balances and scales, and the business accounts for 15%-20% of total revenue (30%-40% of the lab division). This business is Mettlers bread and butter, with market leadership stretching back decades. Though at first glance balances and scales may seem like a commoditized product and we do acknowledge the relatively low-tech nature of this equipment as compared with other high-function lab tools, we see a moat from Mettlers high-quality brand name and scaled-up service operations. With Mettlers acquisition of the Toledo scale company in 1989, Mettler acquired the leading industrial and food retailing scale manufacturer. We dont think Mettler-Toledo could have maintained a market-leading position over the ensuing two decades without some degree of brand recognition. The company places an intense focus on cultivating customer relationships through high-touch customer analytics, and while we dont think this can build an economic moat on its own, we think the success of these programs partially explain Mettlers ability to maintain a strong reputation with customers, helping solidify the firms moatworthy intangible assets.We think Mettlers ability to provide fast and reliable nationwide service is a key component of the value proposition, and service accounts for just over 20% of total revenue. Using uncalibrated, underserviced equipment can affect product quality, cause audit issues, and lead to unscheduled downtime. According to Mettler, the firm has 7 times more service technicians in the U.S. than its next-largest competitor. While it makes sense for the company to have more service personnel, given a dominant share in balances and the firms market leadership in 75% of business lines, Mettler clearly puts a high focus on customer service and relationship-building. Many Mettler products need to be professionally calibrated once a year, though service often occurs more frequently to ensure proper equipment function. In addition to service contracts, which account for the bulk of service revenue, Mettler also provides ad hoc service and replacement parts. We also think the focus on sales and service initiatives, and the ongoing prioritization of the Spinnaker sales and marketing program, contributes to intangible assets from improved returns, although we caution sales and marketing initiatives cannot generate long-lasting competitive advantages on their own. Mettler-Toledo has a number-two global position in titration, behind Switzerland-based Metrohm. Analytical instruments, including titrators, are 10%-15% of total sales and 20%-30% of lab revenue. Lab processes are often built around the use of titrators, which measure the concentration of liquid chemicals and solution. In contrast to simple titrators that one would find in a high school lab, Mettlers industrial titrators are equipped with customizable touchscreens to allow for programmable analysis. The customizable nature of titration equipment creates friction that would need to be overcome for customers to purchase equipment from a competitor. The stickiness of the equipment itself also generates recurring revenue on the service side, as customers are often reliant on Mettler to perform repair service and tend to be unwilling to risk service from an unproven third-party vendor. For these reasons, titrators are a source of customer switching costs for Mettler and contribute meaningfully to the firms moat.Although pipette consumables are not broken out in the firms disclosures, consumables account for about 10% of total sales, and we estimate much of this revenue comes from pipettes. We see decently strong switching costs here, given that pipettes tips are only compatible with same-brand pipettes. Still, the relatively low cost of pipettes and lack of true product differentiation may allow for some price shopping and thereby limit upside to the business, despite the attractive razor/razor blade model.We assert Mettler has a moat in the industrial business from customer stickiness and switching costs on the service side. Mettlers industrials segment consists of core inspection products (industrial weighing, vehicle scale, and dimensional measurement) and product inspection instruments, which are primarily used to scan for product contaminants. The industrial segment accounts for nearly 45% of sales, with 25% in core industrial and the remaining 20% from production inspection. While Mettler is not as dominant in the industrial space compared with the lab business, the company has a broad product portfolio and sells tools for the full manufacturing workflow, from quality control to production and shipping. Mettler has a top global position in this space. Despite a leading share, the industrial scale business is competitive, and Mettlers share of market falls in the 10%-15% range. This business is highly correlated to global manufacturing, though the diversified nature of Mettlers global footprint provides a buffer to manufacturing weakness in any single region. In product inspection, Mettler sells instruments to food and beverage companies that are used to check for contaminants. Products include metal detection, X-rays, and camera-equipped vision inspection tools for labeling and packaging. Mettler is the number one global player in this market, and we view product inspection as a moatworthy business. If a contaminant enters a product and is not caught through inspection, product recalls can occur, which can be highly damaging to customers financial performance in the short term and the firms brand and reputation with retail consumers. As such, food and beverage companies are likely willing to pay a premium for effective inspection equipment and tend to not resist reasonable price increases.We do not see a moat in the food retail business, which accounts for less than 10% of firm sales and EBIT. This segment consists of balances and scales sold into the food retail setting and includes weighing scales used at the supermarket deli and scales used by grocery customers to measure fruits and vegetables. Though Mettler has a leading market position in the business, food retail is a highly competitive space, and competitive bidding to win business from large customers like Walmart through tender offers tends to squeeze margins and limit competitive differentiation.Our narrow economic moat rating is not materially affected by environmental, social, and governance issues. We do not think Mettler-Toledo faces risks related to environmental or social issues, and we note it provides systems and equipment that are used to manufacture many pharmaceutical products with life-saving applications.","We give Mettler-Toledo a Medium Uncertainty Rating. We see moderate risks related to dynamic market conditions, lack of product diversity, and high competition in the industrial and food markets. Mettler is susceptible to capital spending cycles in the highly cyclical industrial market, with industrial accounting for about 40% of EBIT. Though the service component of revenue provides a buffer to cyclical capital spending, the long lifecycle of Mettlers products can cause results to deteriorate during cyclical downturns. In recessionary environments, the success of its pricing initiatives can rely on the economic position of customers, rather than its own product innovation. Generally, we envision margin improvements becoming more difficult over time, too, given the rarified air that Mettler currently inhabits, margin-wise, in a competitive and mature market.Our medium uncertainty rating is not materially affected by ESG issues. ","Our capital allocation rating on Mettler-Toledo remains Exemplary. The rating reflects our assessment of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investment strategy, and a mixed record of shareholder distributions. The firm operates with relatively low leverage and debt/EBITDA has averaged in the low 1s over the past 10 years. Management intends to keep leverage within 1-2 times EBITDA over the longer term, and its debt maturities appear easily manageable. Combined with the firms medium business risk, our opinion of a sound balance sheet contributes to our view that Mettler operates as a very good capital allocator. Mettler-Toledo's investment decisions have been strong, in our view, and investments in internal efficiency programs have significantly enhanced the firms performance over the last decade. We think the cost and execution of these initiatives have enhanced value, with Mettler impressively posting operating margin expansion nearly every year, and reporting above-inflation price hikes, even in a competitive market environment. We think resiliency during the coronavirus pandemic supports our view that management can effectively allocate capital in many environments, and the firm efficiently cut costs and delivered growth that exceeded our expectations. On balance, the evidence suggests Mettlers management team has routinely made value-enhancing investment decisions. We think shareholder distributions have been mixed, though, and have some concern about the prioritization of share repurchases over the adoption of a dividend policy, since we think the firm has consistently repurchased an overvalued stock. We would prefer to see cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends, as this would give shareholders direct capital return without the risk of value destruction from possible subpar repurchase timing. Still, we acknowledge managements hesitation to make dividend commitments, given the more flexible nature of repurchase programs, and there is no indication that management intends to change course and begin issuing a dividend. ","Mettler-Toledo supplies weighing and precision instruments to customers in the life sciences, industrial, and food retail industries. Its products include laboratory and retail scales, pipettes, pH meters, thermal analysis equipment, titrators, metal detectors, and X-ray analyzers. Mettler leads the market for weighing instrumentation and controls more than 50% of the market for lab balances. The business is geographically diversified, with sales distribution roughly as follows: United States around 30% of sales, Europe around 30%, China around 20%, and the rest of the world around 20%.","Mettler-Toledo has good financial strength and has consistently maintained solid levels of free cash flow and reasonable debt, which stood at about 1.6 times EBITDA as of December 2022. Mettler has generated increasing levels of free cash flow in recent years, with $300 million of cash flow in 2017 increasing to over $700 million in 2022. We forecast strong free cash flow through our five-year explicit forecast period in the $850 million-$1.100 billion range. Mettler has typically used much of this cash flow on share buybacks and occasional moderate-size acquisitions. Mettler has enough financial flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in the future, and it has enough cash to look at larger purchases, though we expect most of the cash to be returned to shareholders through the large-scale share-buyback program. Management aims to maintain debt/EBITDA at 1-2 times to fund share buybacks. Also, much of the debt on Mettlers balance sheet is long-dated, and we do not have concerns about it being able to handle its upcoming debt maturities.

24/11/2023,Market Headwinds and Increased Competition Is Affecting IGM Financial's Ability to Expand Its AUM,IGM Financial Inc,IGM,4,02/11/2023,Greggory Warren,33.42,CAD,23/11/2023,38.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,02/11/2023,"While there was little in narrow-moat IGM Financial's third-quarter results that would alter our long-term view of the firm, we are reducing our CAD 42 per share fair value estimate to CAD 38 in response to weaker near-term AUM, revenue, and profitability than we had been projecting, as well as our expectation that the firm will continue to face equity and credit market headwinds over the next several quarters. We view the shares as being modestly undervalued relative to our revised fair value estimate. IGM closed out the September quarter with CAD 218.8 billion in assets under management, or AUM, down 3.3% sequentially but up 4.8% year over year. Consolidated net outflows of CAD 1.1 billion during the quarter were reflective of a negative 1.9% annualized rate of organic AUM growth, within our forecasted range of negative 3% to negative 1% for average annual organic AUM growth during 2023-27, but still a step in the wrong direction as outflows have expanded over the past couple of quarters. We now expect fourth-quarter outflows to be on par with what we saw during the third quarter. While average total AUM was up 3.6% year over year, net asset management fee income improved 4.9% during the third quarter when compared with the prior year's period. Total revenue increased 3.0% year over year during the third quarter. IGM's year-to-date top-line increase of 9.3% hints that the firm will close out 2023 with full-year revenue growth in a mid- to high-single digit range even as the firm now faces a more difficult fourth quarter, below our current expectations. As for profitability, pretax operating margins (exclusive of discontinued operations) continued to decline, falling another 210 basis points to 35.3% during the third quarter, with year-to-date margins down 50 basis points year over year to 35.8%. As we noted above, we expect the fourth quarter to be tougher, with both revenue and profitability ending up lower year over year than the current trend would imply.","With CAD 218.8 billion in AUM at the end of September 2023, IGM Financial is the largest non-bank-affiliated domestic asset manager in the Canadian market. Investors Group has a solid distribution model that has resulted in fairly sticky assets and high operating margins, with more than half of its consultants having four or more years of IG Wealth Management experience. IGM's rollout of ETFs and other new products, its strong distribution network, and new pricing structures for high-net-worth clients could help insulate the firm from some of the headwinds facing the industry.","The largest Canadian banks and insurance companies have expanded the depth of their asset-management offerings and are taking share from purer-play asset managers like IGM Financial. The growth of low-cost passive products, which provide marketlike returns at more reasonable price points, is likely to put even more pressure on management fees for the industry. Poorer investment performance pushed Mackenzie into net outflow mode after the 2008-09 financial crisis, with poor investment performance and above-average pricing keeping the unit from turning things around for years.",02/11/2023,"While IGM Financial has historically generated solid operating margins and hold a decent share of the Canadian mutual fund market, we've been less than impressed by its ability to generate organic growth. Both its asset-management (Mackenzie Investments) and wealth-management (Investors Group Wealth Management) arms have consistently struggled to generate positive flows, with organic growth only moderately positive for both subsidiaries the past five years despite meaningful price cuts aimed at making their offerings more competitive. To us, this is a sign of the weaker competitive position IGM has had historically, with poor investment performance, higher fees, and a reliance on a closed advisor network leaving the firm negatively exposed to secular headwinds for the industry.  Investors Group, with its impressive advisor network of several thousand consultants, has done a much better job of holding on to assets than Mackenzie, illustrated by superior redemption rates despite having a poorer performance record. This illustrates to us the strength of Investors Group's distribution network, which we view as a key asset for IGM. Improving investment performance remains a work in progress, though. IGM's combination of the in-house investment management groups from Mackenzie and Investors Group into a single shop (housed under the Mackenzie Investments brand) has enhanced the scale of the firm's fund manufacturing operations, which should be helpful in an environment where fees are being compressed, but it remains to be seen whether it can improve capabilities and long-term investment performance.  While IGM has attempted to boost flows and performance via other means, including taking price cuts, getting rid of underperforming managers, consolidating product lines, and discontinuing deferred sales commissions, these efforts have had mixed results. As such, we expect the company to continue to look for bolt-on deals (like GLC Asset Management Group in 2021) and investment stakes other asset managers and investment advisory firms (like China AMC and Rockefeller this year) to expand its asset base, product offerings, and channel and geographic reach.","We believe IGM Financial has a narrow economic moat derived from switching costs and intangible assets. The company is the largest non-bank-affiliated asset manager in the Canadian market, with a diverse product mix and fund manufacturing (Mackenzie Investments) and distribution (Investors Group Wealth Management and Investment Planning Counsel) arms. Even though IGM Financial has historically generated solid operating margins and maintains a leading share in the Canadian fund market, we've been less than impressed by its investment performance record and lack of organic growth during the past 5-10 years. We believe the competitive pressures in the Canadian marketwith the big six Canadian banks (one of the primary distribution channels for mutual funds) ramping up sales of their own fund offerings at lower price points than the independent asset managersand a potentially greater focus on fees and performance as fee-based accounts gain traction in the Canadian market, which could lead to a diversion of capital away from higher-fee charging actively managed funds into lower-cost passive products (index funds and exchange-traded funds) in the near to medium term, will only make it all that much harder for IGM Financial to generate outsize returns over the long run.The publicly traded traditional asset managers we cover tend to have economic moats, with switching costs and intangible assets being the most durable sources of competitive advantage. While the switching costs might not be explicitly large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results by moving from one asset manager to another tend to keep many investors in funds for extended periods. As a result, money that flows into asset-management firms tends to stay there, borne out by an average annual redemption rate for long-term mutual funds of less than 20% historically in the Canadian market, which means the average asset manager in Canada will see its assets under management turn over every four to five years. While the barriers to entry are not significant for the industry, the barriers to success are extremely highas it takes time and skill to not only put together a long enough record of investment performance to start gathering assets but to build the scale necessary to be competitive. This has meant that the larger, more established asset managers in the industry have tended to have an advantage over smaller players, especially when it comes to gaining cost-effective access to distribution platforms. Competition for investor inflows can be stiff and has traditionally centered on investment performance, especially in the retail channel. Although institutional investors and retail gatekeepers are exerting pressure on pricing, competition based on price has been rare. While compensation remains the single largest expense for most asset managers, supplier power has been manageable, as many firms have reduced their reliance on star managers and have tied manager and analyst pay to both portfolio and overall firm performance. Asset stickiness (the degree to which assets remain with a manager over time) tends to be a differentiator between wide- and narrow-moat firms, as those asset managers that have demonstrated an ability to gather and retain investor assets during different market cycles have tended to produce more stable levels of profitability, with returns exceeding their cost of capital for longer periods of time. While the more broadly diversified asset managers are structurally set up to hold on to assets regardless of market conditions, it has been firms with solid product sets across asset classes (built on repeatable investment processes), charging reasonable fees, and with singular corporate cultures dedicated to a common purpose that have done a better job of gathering and retaining assets. Firms offering niche products with significantly higher switching costssuch as retirement accounts, funds with lockup periods, and tax-managed strategieshave tended to hold on to assets longer.IIGM Financial had CAD 218.8 billion in assets under management and CAD 34.5 billion in assets under advisement at the end of September 2023, providing it with the size and scale necessary to be competitive in the Canadian market. Although it is the largest non-bank-affiliated asset manager in Canada, we've been less than impressed with the firm's ability to generate organic AUM growth during the past decade or so. This is disappointing, since IGM is structured in a manner that should provide the firm with a fairly sticky set of assets. Armed with a captive salesforce of several thousand advisors, the long-term redemption rate for the IG Wealth Management segment (which accounts for 47% IGM's managed assets and more than half of its operating earnings) has averaged less than 10% during the past decade. This is much better that the 15% redemption rate on long-term mutual funds at IGM Financial's other main segment, Mackenzie Investments (which accounts for 51% of total AUM and close to a quarter of operating earnings), as well as the Canadian industry as a whole, which has averaged something closer to 17%.In general, we look positively on firms whose past actions have enhanced their economic moats and have the capital and wherewithal to maintain their leadership positions and tend to look more skeptically on firms that continue to work on repairing serious deficiencies in their structures or that lack the capital and wherewithal to defend their economic moats longer term. IGM, in our view, has always seemed to be more of a dividend-producing vehicle for no-moat Power Financial (which holds a 62.2% equity stake in IGM Financial) than an independently run asset manager. The company's management has been lackluster at times about attacking deficiencies in its operations, and while many of its competitors have been improving by investing in their business, we've failed to see a similar level of progress in certain asset classes and risk-management processes. While Mackenzie Investment's long-standing strategy has been to acquire asset management companies while trying to maintain the distinct approach of each, it has struggled to retain and hire talent after making these acquisitions.That said, we continue to view the firm's distribution arm (housed primarily in IG Wealth Management) as a powerful asset, believing it to be the greatest contributor to IGM's narrow moat, as it increases switching costs and helps increase intangible asset value through the development of long-term retail-advised client relationships. Having control over this valuable distribution network has allowed IGM to participate in another part of the value chain (all of the services offered by financial advisors) rather than being a fund manufacturer alone. In essence, the firm has benefited from the strength of its advisor relationships as opposed to relying solely on the strength and consistency of fund performance. Good advisors can keep clients from constantly switching products or strategies, as well as from panicking during market upheavals, helping limit redemptions over the long run. This also explains why IG Wealth Management has been able to maintain some of the highest management expense ratios in the industry.In the Canadian retail fund market, financial advisors (including advisors employed by banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and independent advisory shops) have control over more than 80% of the country's AUM, which basically means that most retail investors are working directly with advisors to gain access to mutual funds. As these advisors have traditionally relied on trailer feeswhich are pulled directly from mutual fundsfor upwards of two thirds of their annual compensation, it has not been too surprising to see very little penetration for low-cost index funds and ETFs (which tend not to pay trailer fees) and a lot of higher-fee-charging poorer-performing funds still available for purchase. During much of the past decade, the big six banks (and some of the other distributors that have in-house fund management operations) have had the best of both worlds, offering up funds with lower management fees than those offered by the purer-play asset managers, while still capturing trailer fees on their own products that were being sold through their branch and advisory networks. For asset managers that have had weaker performance records, like IGM Financial's Mackenzie unit, and more specifically AGF Management, the result has been negative organic growth and a greater reliance on trailer fees to gain and maintain access to third-party platforms.At this point, we see just one direction for active management feesand that is down. While many of the independent asset managers have already cut fees during the past five years, primarily in response to the banks using price as a tool for taking share from the independents (which we expect to continue), we believe that regardless of reputation, product set, or distribution network, fee pressures will continue for the entire industry. That said, for firms like IGM, which has already been aggressive with price cuts (and has taken the bolder move of combining its Mackenzie and Investors Group fund operations into a single operating unit with the enhanced scale allowing the firm to absorb continued fee compression) we don't envision the cuts being nearly as heavy as we are anticipating for the rest of the industrywhere 5%-plus annual reductions in management fee rates in each of the next several years are likely to be the norm for run-of-the-mill active asset managers with mediocre performance.","Our Uncertainty Rating for IGM Financial is Medium. Currently, we do not consider any of the firm's environmental, social, or governance issues to be material enough to affect our uncertainty rating or fair value estimate for the firm. We believe that IGM Financial faces three main risks: asset price volatility, weak investment performance, and an intensifying competitive environment. A market selloff would have a negative impact on the firm, as lower asset prices would lead to market losses, outflows and ultimately lower levels of AUM revenue, and profitability. Management and administrative fees, which account for around 80% of annual revenue, are linked to average levels of AUM. While some percentage of compensation is variable, a declining top line would have an outsize impact on earnings because of the operating leverage inherent in the asset-management business. With the Canadian banks, which handle most of the fund distribution in Canada, putting a greater focus on fund manufacturing, market share has also been lost and management fees have been pressured. In addition to distributors turning into competitors, other fund providers are gaining traction in Canada, including some of the largest U.S. providers of index funds and exchange-traded fundsBlackRock and Vanguardwith the market for these products growing at an accelerated rateand persistent investment underperformance could result in substantial market share losses over time. We expect there will be an increased focus on historical fund performance in the Canadian market, with the worst performers losing the most share and having the hardest time justifying management fees. That said, IGM is at a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors, due to its low to medium exposure to risks inherent to the industry, as well as its own operations, offset by the firm's solid management of its material ESG issues.","James O'Sullivan has been president and CEO of IGM Financial since September 2020. R. Jeffrey Orr, who was president and CEO of IGM Financial during 2001-05, is chair of the board of directors (as well as president and CEO of Power Financial, which holds a 62.1% equity stake in IGM). O'Sullivan joined IGM Financial following a 30-year career at Scotiabank, where he was responsible for the bank's Canadian retail and commercial banking and global wealth and asset management activities. Our capital allocation rating for IGM is Standard. This rating focuses on the three key areas we look at to assess management efficacy: balance sheet health, investment efficacy, and shareholder distributions. Given that a firm's financial health directly affects its ability to invest in future growth opportunities, return cash to shareholders, or even remain a going concern, it is important to pay attention to balance sheet strength. Asset managers have a high degree of revenue cyclicality and operating leverage (with results tending to be impacted by the vagaries of the equity and credit markets) and are generally asset light. As such, they should not maintain more than low to moderate levels of financial leverage. IGM, in our view, has a fairly sound balance sheet, with CAD 0.5 billion in cash and equivalents, CAD 0.8 billion in investments, and CAD 2.4 billion in long-dated debt (on a principal basis) on its books at the end of September 2023. The firm has historically maintained very low debt/total capital and debt/EBITDA levels, and we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA (as well as to enterprise value) to remain low, with none of the company's outstanding debt due during the next three years.IGM's long-term strategy has been focused on investing in the business (focused on finding ways to improve fund performance and enhancing the competitive positioning of its different subsidiaries), maintaining financial strength and flexibility, returning a substantial portion of earnings to shareholders as share repurchases and dividends, and (when it makes sense) acquiring businesses that fill either a product or distribution hole. In our view, better cultures and internal investment processes tend to lead to better and more consistent investment performance, organic growth, and relatively little employee turnover. When growth becomes harder and harder to come by, which has become the case for the more traditional asset managers like IGM, we expect firms to take a variety of different actions, including overhauling their leadership or their investment processes, buying a competitor with better performance or greater product, channel, or geographic diversity, or branching out more aggressively into less-exposed strategies.As IGM has focused more heavily on improving investment performance, little has been spent on acquisitions. That said, former CEO Jeffrey Carney was not averse to growth through acquisitions, exemplified by the company's investments in three financial technology companiesPersonal Capital, Wealthsimple, and Portage Venturesas well as a growing stake in China Asset Management, one of China's first and largest investment management companies. We expect IGM to continue to look for bolt-on deals, like GLC Asset Management Group in 2021. On the distribution front, the firm has historically been good about returning excess capital to shareholders, but generally more as dividends than as share repurchases. During the past 10 calendar years, the firm repurchased (on a net basis) CAD 727 million of common stock and paid out CAD 5.4 billion as dividends. We believe that the firm's average payout ratio of 66.0% during 2018-20 was somewhat high and expect it to be closer to 60% on average going forward with some additional capital dedicated to share repurchases. That said, this also assumes that the quarterly dividend remains static at CAD 0.5625 per share over the next five years.","IGM Financial is the largest non-bank-affiliated asset manager in Canada. The firm is part of the Power Financial group of companies, which includes Great-West Life, London Life, and Canada Life. IGM has two main operating divisionsasset management (operated through Mackenzie Investments) and wealth management (via its Investors Group Wealth Management and Investment Planning Counsel subsidiaries)that provide investment management products and services. IGM had CAD 218.8 billion in assets under management, or AUM, and CAD 34.5 billion in assets under advisement, or AUA, at the end of September 2023. Investment Planning Counsel is now being accounted for as a discontinued operation, having been sold earlier this year (with the deal expected to close by the end of 2023).","IGM Financial entered the fourth quarter of 2023 with CAD 2.4 billion in long-term debt on its books, consisting of CAD 400 million of 3.44% notes due January 2027, CAD 125 million of 6.65% notes due December 2027, CAD 150 million of 7.45% notes due May 2031, CAD 175 million of 7.00% notes due December 2032, CAD 150 million of 7.11% notes due March 2033, CAD 200 million of 6.00% notes due December 2040, CAD 200 million of 4.56% notes due January 2047, CAD 250 million of 4.115% notes due December 2047, CAD 200 million of 4.174% notes due July 2048, CAD 300 million of 5.426% notes due May 2053, and CAD 250 million of 4.206% notes due March 2050. Should the company close out the year in line with our expectations, IGM would enter 2024 with a debt/total capital ratio of 30%, a debt/EBITDA ratio (by our calculations) of 2.1 times, and an EBITDA interest coverage ratio of 11 times.Overall, we think IGM is in decent financial health, generating high levels of free cash flow while using limited amounts of capital, allowing it to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet short- and long-term obligations. Management's top priorities for its free cash flow remain investments in the business (organically, as well as through select acquisitions), dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt repayment. With most of IGM Financial's debt obligations being long-dated, and the firm having historically spent little on acquisitions, we expect the bulk of its excess cash (after internal investments) to be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and, to a lesser extent, share repurchases. While the company had increased its dividend at a double-digit rate before the 2008-09 financial crisis, the quarterly dividend was stuck at CAD 0.5375 per share for 13 straight quarters until IGM raised it to CAD 0.5625 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014. Given the current payout ratio of around 65% of estimated 2023-24 earnings, we don't envision much growth in the dividend.",IGM.TO,Financial Services,8144114688.0,TOR,115903.0,CAD,33.2599983215332,True,1,35.76071421305118,35.275975622784145,1
24/11/2023,Lithium Argentina Should Benefit From Strong Demand as Its First Project Ramps Up Production,Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp,LAAC,5,08/11/2023,Seth Goldstein,7.77,CAD,23/11/2023,34.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,B,08/11/2023,"Lithium Argentina's third-quarter results, its first quarter since the separation from the previous Lithium Americas, highlighted the continued progression of the Cauchari-Olaroz project. The project entered production early in the fourth quarter and management affirmed its production estimates of 5,000 metric tons in 2023. While Cauchari-Olaroz appears on a successful track toward ramping up its phase 1 production, we delayed our forecasts for the Pastos Grandes project, and now expect the neighboring production site to produce its first lithium in 2030, as we think Lithium Argentina and partner Ganfeng will need a longer timeline for project development than we had previously forecast. We also incorporated lower near-term lithium prices.  Having updated our model to reflect these changes, we reduce our fair value estimate to $25 per share from $30 per share. Our CAD-denominated fair value estimate falls to CAD 34 from CAD 41. Of the $5 reduction in our USD fair value estimate, $4 comes from our delayed timeline for the Pastos Grandes project, while $1 comes from lower near-term lithium prices. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. At current prices, Lithium Argentina is the most undervalued lithium producer under our coverage. Shares trade at less than 25% of our updated fair value estimate.  We think the market is pessimistic about lithium prices, which have fallen to a little below $23,000 per metric based on published index pricing. While supply has grown more than demand in 2023 to move the market closer to balance, we think inventory destocking among battery producers has exacerbated the lithium price decline in the second half of the year. However, we forecast destocking will largely run its course by the end of the year, setting up 2024 for a more normal demand environment. As demand growth remains steady from rising global EV sales, we forecast the lithium market will move back to undersupplied conditions in 2024, leading to rising prices.  ","Lithium Argentina will become a low-cost lithium producer generating profitability regardless of lithium prices. As a lithium pure play, Lithium Argentina is well positioned to increase profits from EV growth through lithium batteries. Lithium prices will remain well above the marginal cost of production through at least the remainder of the decade, leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Lithium Argentina.","Lithium prices will fall as new supply comes online faster than demand, which will weigh on profitability. Lithium Argentinas investment in its two projects will prove value-destructive in the wake of lower prices. With operations in Argentina, Lithium Argentina is exposed to additional political risk. Threats of higher royalties would weigh on the firm's profit. Lithium Argentina faces elevated project execution risk from developing a new greenfield project that could lead to delays and cost overruns, proving value destructive. ",08/11/2023," Lithium Argentina is a pure-play lithium producer with two assets in Argentina. The company was created as a result of the former Lithium Americas separation, which separated the firm's Argentina and North America businesses. Chauchari-Olaroz is Lithium Argentina's first and largest project. The firm owns a 44.8% interest in the project, while Ganfeng, one of the world's largest lithium producers, owns 46.7%. The remaining 8.5% is owned by JEMSE, an Argentinian state-owned mining company. The project recently entered production in 2023 and is in the process of ramping up production volumes to the project's first-phase annual capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Additionally, management is planning to begin construction on a second phase for at least an additional 20,000 metric tons of annual lithium capacity. On a cost basis, Chauchari-Olaroz will be one of the lowest-cost producers in the world, and will have a cost position similar to that of other Argentinian brine assets in operation. Lithium Argentina is also developing a second project in Argentina. This project will be in the Pastos Grandes basin, where Lithium Argentina is combining two projects that were in the early development phases into a single project. The two projects are Lithium Argentina's 100%-owned Pastos Grandes project, and its 65% owned Sal de la Puna project, which are directly adjacent to one another. Lithium Argentina's Cauchari-Olaroz partner, Ganfeng, owns the remaining 35% of Sal de la Puna, so the development team from Cauchari-Olaroz should be able to advance the combined project in the Pastos Grandes basin. We forecast the project to enter production early next decade and will likely have a low cost position relative to the global cost curve, but slightly higher than other Argentina brine projects, as early development studies indicate brine in the Pastos Grandes basin has a lower lithium concentration. As electric vehicle adoption increases, we expect maintained double-digit annual growth for lithium demand. Lithium Americas should benefit as there should be more than enough demand for company's two resources to enter production and expand capacity over time.","We award a narrow moat to Lithium Argentina. The firms Chauchari-Olaroz asset recently entered production, and given the high-quality brine resource, we think it will have a cost advantage when the first phase is fully ramped up. As the Pastos Grandes project is still in the early development phase, we assign the project a no-moat rating. While initial development studies indicate the project would be cost advantaged, there is still too much uncertainty around the project. Chauchari-Olaroz is the larger of the company's two projects, and we estimate it will account for the majority of profits even after Pastos Grandes enters production.Globally, lithium has been produced from either the evaporation of brine or the mining of hard rock minerals (spodumene or lepidolite). Both of Lithium Argentina's assets are brine-based projects. In general, lithium carbonate production via brine, which is prominent in Chile and Argentina, costs less than lithium from hard-rock resources, including spodumene, which is prevalent in Australia, or lepidolite, which occurs in China. The Salar de Atacama in Chile, (where both Albemarle and SQM operate) is the highest-quality lithium brine resource globally because of superior concentration levels and desirable climate conditions (arid climate with high evaporation rates), when compared with other brine resources.While Chilean brine has a cost advantage on a cash cost basis, this advantage diminishes on an all-in maintaining cost basis, which includes taxes and royalties, and is our preferred cost measurement. Chile enforces a progressive tax rate for lithium producers, where higher realized lithium prices are met with a higher progressive tax rate, while we estimate Argentinas total royalty and export taxes to be only 7%. Using our current marginal cost of production estimate of $20,000 per metric ton, the Chilean royalty amounts to an effective rate of 27%, well above the Argentine rate. Under our current lithium price forecast, we estimate that Cauchari-Olaroz will be the lowest-cost resource globally on an overall maintaining basis. Even if lithium prices fall below our marginal cost forecast, we estimate the project would still be the lowest-cost resource as long as lithium prices remain above $14,000 per metric ton. As a result, we think Chauchari-Olaroz will prove to have a strong cost advantage versus margin cost producers.Alternatively, we assign Pastos Grandes a no-moat rating. We see potential for the resource to have a cost advantage versus marginal cost producers once in production. Early development studies indicate Pastos Grandes has a lower lithium concentration versus Cauchari-Olaroz and will likely be slightly higher cost, but still a low-cost project on the global cost curve. However, the project is still in the early development phase and will likely not begin production until at least later in the decade. Given that the project is still in the early development phase, we see too much uncertainty around it to award it a moat rating. Our base case is that Pastos Grandes will enter production early next decade and have a relatively low cost of production. However, additional development work may result in the project being delayed or canceled. Even if the project moves forward, construction risks include higher than expected capital costs or material delays. In operation, actual costs could be materially higher than our forecast. As a result of the project uncertainty, we view it as no moat for now, but will reevaluate our rating as the project advances.Regardless, we think Cauchari-Olarozs strong cost advantage will materialize in the next couple of years to generate excess returns on invested capital even in a lower lithium price environment. Accordingly, we are confident Lithium Argentina is more likely than not to outearn its cost of capital over the next decade.","We assign a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Lithium Argentina.As a pure-play lithium company with two projects, one just beginning commercial production in 2023, and one still under development, project execution is the biggest risk facing Lithium Americas. This includes ramping up volumes, putting forth a battery-quality product, reducing unit production costs at one project, and advancing in project development at the other.Volatility in lithium prices is another large risk. Lithium prices could decline if electric vehicle demand grows more slowly than expected. Electric vehicle demand could undershoot expectations if fuel cell technology were to overtake lithium as the dominant power source for next-generation vehicles. Additionally, lithium production could ramp up more quickly than demand warrants if too much supply enters the market. Further, new lithium production technologies could alter the supply curve. Additionally, Lithium Americas is also planning to make large investments to grow its production capacity over time, which adds execution risk and could result in cost overruns.Finally, Lithium Argentina will produce lithium in Argentina. This exposes the company to the risk that the government may impose additional taxes that would greatly reduce profits. Given the significantly lower total tax and royalty rate in Argentina versus Chile, we think all lithium producers in Argentina face the risk of higher royalties, especially as President Alberto Fernandez campaigned on a populist platform.The largest environmental, social, and governance risks come from potential emission reduction requirements from Lithium Argentina's customers. While we see this as being only moderately probable to occur, we see a low materiality as all lithium producers would be subject to the same requirements, so the company could likely pass along these costs. Lithium Argentina serves customers from its already reduced-emission lithium coming from Argentina.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Lithium Argentina based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We view Lithium Argentinas balance sheet as sound. The company currently has a solid balance sheet with cash exceeding debt. With its current cash position and cash flows generated from Chauchari-Olaroz as it ramps up production, the firm should be able to finance much Chauchari-Olaroz stage 2 without a lot of debt. As such, the firm should remain in a strong financial position moving forward.We see managements investment as fair. Although Chauchari-Olarloz is just entering production and its too soon to judge success of the large capital investment, we do agree with managements strategy as its deployed capital into two different Argentinian lithium production assets. We think Chauchari-Olaroz will be the lowest cost lithium asset in the world on an AISC basis under our lithium price forecast. Management has already outlined its planned for Chauchari-Olaroz stage 2, and is committed to ramping the project to 80,000 tons of annual capacity.Additionally, Lithium Argentina has been committed to further expanding its footprint as a leading global lithium supplier with its 2021 acquisition of Pastos Grandes. Also, the firm has been building a stake in the Sal de la Puna asset, which LAAC now owns 65% interest in. The project sits adjacent, and even intertwined with the Pastos Grandes asset. Both of these assets are likely to be low-cost resources once in production later in the decade. Although too early to judge the efficacy of the firms investments, we ultimately agree with their strategy. The lithium carbonate market is likely to be undersupplied throughout much of the decade and we think shareholder value will be maximized by firms that are heavily investing now in bringing on new capacity.From an execution standpoint, we rate the company as neutral. Chauchari-Olaroz has recently entered production within a reasonable time of their original timeframe. Also, as Chauchari-Olaroz is the firms first asset to enter the market, we support the partnership with Ganfeng, one of the world's leading lithium producers. Ganfeng is experienced in both upstream and downstream operations, and think the firm will be valuable in streamlining the assets vertical operations. Additionally, the Pastos Grandes and Sal de la Puna assets are within the same region as Chauchari-Olaroz, and think it well make an easy transition for the construction process once the projects begin.Finally, we think the firms distribution strategy is appropriate. As Lithium Argentina is just beginning to generate revenue, we think it is appropriate to invest in capacity expansions at Cauchari-Olaroz and the development of Pastos Grandes. The firm currently does not pay a dividend or buy back shares, and we would not expect this to change until both projects are in production and the firm is generating positive free cash flow.Lithium Argentina is the Argentinia business created in the Lithium Americas separation. John Kanellitsas is the interim CEO of Lithium Argentina. He has over 25 years of industy experience. Kanellitsas was with the old Lithium Americas since 2011, most recently as the Executive Vice Chairman. Prior to joinng Lithium Americas, Kanellitsas was the COO of Geologic Resource Partners.","Lithium Argentina is a pure-play lithium producer. The company owns two neighboring lithium brine resources in northwest Argentina: Chauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes. Chauchari-Olaroz entered production in 2023, while Pastos Grandes is still in development. Lithium Argentina plans for both resources to be fully integrated with onside downstream processing capabilities and will sell into the lithium chemical market.","Lithium Argentina is in a solid financial position. After the recent separation of Lithium Americas, Lithium Argentina began trading on Oct. 4, 2023. The company was allocated $176 million in cash and is net cash positive as cash exceeds total debt. Now that Chauchari-Olaroz is producing, the firm's current cash balance and cash flows generated from Chauchari-Olaroz should be adequate to fund new capital expenditures dollar for stage two and development on the Pastos Grandes construction in the near term.Later in the decade, as we forecast management to continue investing in Chauchari-Olaroz capacity and as Pastos Grandes construction begins, management may need to turn to debt financing to help fund construction at both sites. Given its current low debt levels and outlook for elevated lithium prices, we think Lithium Argentina should be able to fund future expansions at Cauchari-Olaroz and the development and construction of Pastos Grandes.",LAAC.TO,Basic Materials,1202145024.0,TOR,202608.0,CAD,7.789999961853027,True,1,9.245273618469048,6.929878019703658,0
24/11/2023,FMCs Pipeline Should Help Long-Term Profits Across Diverse Geographies and Crops As Patents Expire,FMC Corp,FMC,5,17/11/2023,Seth Goldstein,53.12,USD,23/11/2023,110.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,17/11/2023,"Our key takeaway from FMC's investor day was the strength of the company's pipeline. Our long-term thesis on FMC has been that the company's strong pipeline will generate sales growth at a mid-single-digit rate, even when including the impact of the diamide patent expirations. These patent contributions made up 36% of FMC's revenue in 2022. We forecast FMC will generate growth from its pipeline of traditional crop chemicals and biologicals, with each product category contributing around half of the premium product revenue growth. As the company launches and ramps up new products, we see a clear path for adjusted EBITDA margins to recover to the mid-20% level, after falling to the low-20% level this year. With our outlook intact, we maintain our $110 per share fair value estimate for FMC. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged. We view FMC shares as materially undervalued, with the stock trading at roughly 50% of our fair value estimate. We think the market is overly focused on the near-term decline in FMC's profits due to industrywide inventory destocking. In our view, inventory destocking has affected all of the company's premium product peers, when isolating crop protection products and accounting for differing geographical exposure. Further, we think the market gives FMC virtually no credit for its pipeline, while also assuming FMC's diamide portfolio faces a patent cliff, leading to lower long-term profits. Accordingly, we see a strong margin of safety in the current share price, with much of the bad news already priced in.","FMC has transformed its portfolio to focus on crop chemicals, which should see strong growth prospects as yield gains are needed to support rising food consumption from emerging markets. FMC's focus on developing new biologicals will prove value-accretive as biological crop protection products continue to take market share from synthetic crop chemicals. FMC's pipeline should allow the company to continue expanding profits as the patents expire for its two largest molecules over the next decade.","FMC's patents have begun to expire for its two largest molecules. This will weigh on long-term profits as the company will face declining sales and margin compression from the patent expirations. The crop chemical space is competitive, with many products vying for market share. These companies require consistently high spending on R&D to maintain a pipeline of new products. As a crop chemical producer, FMC is negatively exposed to the decreased insecticide demand resulting from greater adoption of insect-resistant, genetically modified crops.",17/11/2023,"FMC is a pure-play crop chemical producer. It is one of the five largest patented crop protection companies globally. FMC acquired Cheminova in 2015, increasing exposure to Europe and expanding its portfolio of crop chemicals. In late 2017, FMC acquired DuPont's crop chemical portfolio, which included the blockbuster diamide insecticides. At the same time, it divested its nonagriculture businesses. FMC is fairly balanced geographically among North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Latin America contributed 36% of revenue in 2022, while the remaining regions accounted for 18%-25% each. The company is also balanced by crop exposure, with soybeans the largest at nearly 20% of total revenue. A pipeline of new premium products should allow FMC to continue producing new crop chemicals as older products roll off patent. In the near term, however, FMC's largest productsthe diamides, which generated 36% of sales in 2022are set to see patents expire and face increased competition from generic products in the coming years. The company plans to launch 10 new molecules over the next decade that feature new modes of action. FMC also plans to launch new biologicals, or environmentally friendly pesticides, and has increased its exposure to these products through the acquisition of BioPhero. Biologicals should help farmers fight resistant pests, which are increasingly rendering older crop chemicals ineffective. FMC's product portfolio currently skews toward insecticides, which generate over half of revenue. As genetically modified organism seeds, which are equipped with traits to fight insects, expand to new markets such as China and India over the next decade, we see insecticide demand falling over the long term. Conversely, GMO seeds increase herbicide demand. For FMC, many of its new products in the pipeline are herbicides and fungicides, which should result in a more balanced portfolio among the three primary types of crop protection chemicals as new products are commercialized over the next decade.","We assign FMC a narrow economic moat rating owing to intangible assets in its crop chemical business. Our moat rating for FMC rests primarily on its portfolio of crop chemical patents. Similar to pharmaceutical companies, crop chemical companies realize premium prices on their patented products, generating returns in excess of the cost of capital. It typically takes more than seven years to bring products to market. In addition to years of research and development, these chemicals require regulatory approvals as they are tested for consumer, environmental, and worker safety. Approved patents have protection that lasts for 20 years from the research phase on the active ingredient, which is known as the molecule. Crop chemical companies, including FMC, take additional steps to extend a successful products patent life by up to five years by patenting the product formula and the manufacturing process. Particularly successful patents are often licensed by competitors. While FMC is smaller than the largest companies in the industry, it has nevertheless built a valuable portfolio of patents. The crop chemical industry is composed of sales of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. FMC operates in all three segments, with strong assets in herbicides and insecticides.FMCs two largest patented products, diamides, accounted for over 35% of sales, or roughly $2.1 billion, in 2022. These products were included in the acquisition of DuPont's crop chemical portfolio. The molecules began to go off patent in 2022, with manufacturing patents beginning to expire in 2026. Sulfentrazone, FMCs third-largest patented product, is an example of the company's patent portfolio strength before the DuPont acquisition. In North and South America, decades of use of glyphosate and other top herbicides have led to growing acres of weed resistance to those chemicals. Sulfentrazone helps farmers treat glyphosate-resistant acres. While sulfentrazones molecule is off patent, the company has licensing agreements in place with generic crop chemical producers that allow FMC to maintain solid profit margins, albeit at lower sales. FMC has implemented the same partner licensing strategy with the diamides, which should reduce the deterioration of its sales and profits from the diamide patent expirations, as has been the case with sulfentrazone.Additionally, FMC's portfolio of new products in the pipeline should somewhat protect expiring patents. FMC has 10 new crop chemical molecules (the active ingredients) under development, including multiple new modes of action. These new products should be particularly effective against insects, weeds, and fungi that have grown resistant to traditional crop chemicals. With bug resistance growing globally, demand for FMC's new products should allow the company to safely outearn its cost of capital over the next decade.","We assign FMC a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.The largest risk for FMC is its ability to maintain its premium prices as patents expire, which can affect companywide revenue growth and profitability. In 2022, the molecules for FMC's two largest crop protection chemicals, which generated nearly 36% of revenue that year, began to go off patent; manufacturing process patents will begin to expire in 2026. As patents for FMC's premium products expire, the company must invest in R&D to develop new products in order to maintain the same levels of profitability. We think FMC has a solid R&D pipeline, but there is no guarantee that these investments will bear fruit. Weeds, insects, and fungi could develop resistance to seed traits or crop chemical formulations, rendering FMC's technology ineffective.Additionally, FMC faces factors outside its control, such as declining crop prices and farmer incomes, which would lead to lower crop chemical demand. Industry growth could also be negatively affected by the increased adoption of insect-resistant genetically modified seeds in emerging markets such as China and India. Unfavorable weather conditions can hurt demand in a region in any given year. Further, the crop chemical industry is highly competitive, and FMC must continue to develop better products than its peers to justify a premium price.FMC's largest environmental, social, and governance risks come from potential regulations. This includes the risk that its products may be banned due to environmental impact concerns. While this risk has a moderate probability to occur over time, FMC is investing in the development of more environmentally friendly products. As a result, we see a low materiality as new products would replace lost sales. Additionally, FMC may face regulations on the emissions, waste, and carbon produced from its operations. We think this has a modest probability but low materiality as FMC should be able to pass along the higher cost to customers.","We assign FMC a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We view FMC's balance sheet as weak. We see moderate cyclicality risk from the company operating in the crop chemical industry. Additionally, FMC currently has elevated leverage, as crop chemical demand is approaching a cyclical bottom.We view management's investments as fair. We are in favor of FMC's strong investment in R&D to create new premium products that span new crops and fight new weeds, insects, and fungi. The company has also done a good job of commercializing its pipeline, which we expect to continue. Further, we think management has a solid record of integrating and adding value from acquisitions. We are also in favor of the decision to invest heavily in biologicals, given that they should continue to take market share from synthetic crop protection products in the coming years. The BioPhero acquisition provides a complementary type of biologicals product to FMC, which should position the portfolio to develop new premium products over the long run.However, we think management has not done a great job of insulating the company from its diamide patent expiration. FMC has invested to increase diamide revenue while it faces increasing competition from generic producers as the patents on some diamide molecules have begun to expire.We think distributions are appropriate. FMC should have sufficient cash flows to continue healthy reinvestment in its business and maintain a healthy balance sheet. The current dividend seems appropriate.CEO Mark Douglas has led FMC since June 2020. He joined the company in 2010 and became COO in 2018 after working over 20 years at Dow Chemical and Rohm & Haas. Douglas replaced Pierre Brondeau, who had been CEO since 2010 and is now chair of the board of directors. Under Brondeau's leadership, FMC transformed into a pure-play crop protection company through two value-added acquisitions while divesting noncore assets at reasonable prices.Managements long-term compensation is based on total shareholder return and operating cash flow over a rolling three-year period. While the total shareholder return metric aligns management with shareholders over a short-term period, we would prefer compensation metrics to include return on invested capital to encourage management to position the business for long-term success.","FMC is a pure-play crop chemical company. It has diversified its sales to create a balanced crop chemical portfolio across geographies and crop exposure. Through acquisitions, FMC is now one of the five largest patented crop chemical companies and will continue to develop new products, with a focus on biologicals, through its research and development pipeline.","FMC is in decent financial health. We calculate a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio of roughly 3.3 times as of Sept. 30. We expect FMC's leverage ratios will remain elevated over the next couple of years as lower sales volumes and reduced plant capacity utilization weigh on profits. Longer term, as volumes return to normal levels and FMC sees growth from new product launches, we expect the company's leverage ratio will fall back in line to management's target of around 2 times.FMC's leverage ratios fluctuate throughout the year as the company is subject to seasonality. With no large planned capital additions, FMC should should be able to meet all its financial requirements, including dividends, going forward.",FMC,Basic Materials,6955314176.0,NYQ,2054727.0,USD,53.119998931884766,True,1,71.87964719884589,57.868024802503705,1
24/11/2023,Mastercard Enjoys a Wide Moat and Good Growth Prospects,Mastercard Inc,MA,3,26/10/2023,Brett Horn,410.33,USD,23/11/2023,406.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,26/10/2023,"Mastercard's third-quarter results largely mirrored those of its peer Visa, although growth did slow a bit sequentially. Overall, consumer spending appears to be resilient, and Mastercard continues to benefit from a bounceback in cross-border spendingin which the consumer and merchant are in different countries. Mastercards fees on these transactions are much higher. We are comfortable with our $406 per share fair value estimate for the wide-moat company and consider shares fairly valued. Net revenue was up 14% year over year, or 11% when excluding currency impacts. Gross dollar volume increased 11% on a constant-currency basis, and switched transactions were up 15%. While growth is still healthy, it did decelerate modestly sequentially, and the figures for October declined a bit more. We don't make much of minor deviations in quarterly growth, but we do think the market may be overly sensitive to any near-term shifts given the current macroeconomic uncertainty. Cross-border volume has helped drive strong growth for Mastercard over the past couple of years as travel spending has recovered from the drop during the pandemic. Constant-currency cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe transactionswhich are priced similarly to domestic transactionsgrew 24% year over year in the third quarter. While this is still a healthy rate and Mastercard's growth is better than Visa's, growth has declined in the past few quarters as the company has started to converge on the prepandemic trend, and this tailwind may be coming to an end. Adjusted operating margins (on a net revenue basis) improved to 58.8% compared with 57.7% last year, as solid growth appears to have led to some scale benefits. However, client incentives increased 22% year over year. We continue to believe the company will see only very modest margin improvement on a gross revenue basis, as Mastercard will likely share most of its scale benefits with issuer clients in the form of higher incentives.",Mastercard historically has outperformed Visa in terms of growth. Its smaller size and some leveling in market share between the two could maintain this trend. There is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed cash payments on a global basis a couple of years ago. Management is appropriately focused on long-term growth opportunities and not near-term margins.,"Mastercard is a distant number-two player in a scalable industry, which could hamper long-term margins. The oligopolistic nature of the industry makes Visa and Mastercard a target for regulators, and the companies have historically paid some large fines. UnionPay provides an example of how governments could favor local networks, and this could shut Mastercard out of some emerging-market opportunities.",28/09/2023,"Mastercard has multiple characteristics that should draw investors attention. First, despite the evolution in the payment space, we think a wide moat surrounds the business and view Mastercards position in the current global electronic payment infrastructure as essentially unassailable. Second, Mastercard benefits from the ongoing shift toward electronic payments, which provides plenty of opportunities to utilize its wide moat to create value over the long term. Digital payments, on a global basis, surpassed cash payments just a few years ago, suggesting that this trend still has a lot of room to run, and we think emerging markets could offer a further leg of growth even as growth in developed markets starts to slow. Finally, Mastercard is something of a tollbooth business, and the company is relatively agnostic to smaller shifts in the electronic payment space, as it earns fees regardless of whether payment is credit, debit, or mobile. Mastercard has not been without issues recently. Cross-border transactions, which are particularly lucrative for the networks, came under heavy pressure due to the fallout from the pandemic and a reduction in global travel. We expected a full recovery, and that has largely played out, although the ongoing bounceback remains a tailwind. From a longer-term point of view, we think it is likely that smaller and more regional networks are building out capacity for cross-border transactions, which could eat into growth a bit in the coming years, but we haven't seen a material effect yet.  In the near term, we see the state of the economy as Mastercards biggest risk. A downturn in the economy would slow overall growth, as Mastercards revenue is sensitive to the volume and dollar amount of consumer transactions. The company saw growth decline significantly during the early stages of the pandemic. But we dont see any industry trends that will impede Mastercards ability to maintain double-digit growth in the coming years, and the company looks poised to continue to modestly outperform its larger peer, Visa.","Payment networks such as Mastercard benefit, unsurprisingly, from a network effect. The more consumers that are plugged into a payment network, the more attractive that payment network becomes for merchants, which, in turn, makes the network more convenient for consumers and so on. In our view, this dynamic explains why a handful of networks have come to dominate electronic payments over time, and at this point, Mastercard has reached essentially universal acceptance in most developed markets. While the network effect is the initial and primary driver of economic moats in the space, the highly scalable nature of payment processing leads to sizable cost advantages for large payment networks, which further cements their competitive positions. For the dominant payment networks with global footprints, such as Mastercard, the network effect and resulting cost advantage is strong enough to lead to a wide moat, in our view.Mastercards origin lies in the formation of the Interbank Card Association by a group of banks that acquired Master Charge in 1969 and adopted the companys current logo. In the decades since, Mastercard has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the ongoing shift toward using electronic payments. During 2021, the company processed over $6 trillion in purchase transactions. Visa, meanwhile, processes roughly twice as many transactions as Mastercard and leads it in terms of market share in every major global region. However, Mastercard has a similarly commanding lead over any other network and is the only other company with a truly global presence. Mastercards global market share for credit and debit cards has been estimated at 29% and 24%, respectively, a level that dwarfs competitors outside of Visa. We dont believe that building a new network with a comparable size and reach is realistic over any foreseeable time line and view Mastercards position within the current global electronic payment infrastructure as essentially unassailable.Mastercard has translated its dominant competitive position into an enviable level of profitability. Operating margins (using net revenue) in 2022 were 57%, and margins have generally trended upward over time due to the scalability of the business. Further, given the relatively asset-light nature of the business, returns on invested capital are very high, averaging 114% over the past five years.","Mastercards revenue is tied to the amount and volume of consumer purchases, which creates significant macroeconomic sensitivity. Cross-border transactions are highly lucrative for Mastercard, making the company particularly sensitive to any swings in these types of transactions. Both Visa and Mastercard have paid substantial fines historically related to the oligopolistic nature of the industry, and we see legal and regulatory risk as intrinsic to the business model, given merchants desires to lower fees. While Visa's and Mastercards positions in the current electronic payment infrastructure are largely set, the payment industry continues to evolve in ways that could reduce their volume or profitability. Some governments have shown a preference for local payment networks, which could freeze Mastercard out of certain markets and impede the value it drives from its global network. We see the company's largest environmental, social, and governance risk as data security. Any company involved in processing payments has potential exposure to breaches in its systems.","Our capital allocation rating for Mastercard is Standard. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We have a generally favorable view of the management team at Mastercard, but we believe the company's wide moat and favorable secular trends have been the dominant factor behind its strong historical results. Ajay Banga served as the companys CEO from 2010 until the end of 2020. Banga initially moved to the chairman position, but then retired at the end of 2021. Michael Miebach, who has been with the company for over 10 years and previously served as chief product officer, replaced Banga as CEO. We like that Miebach has held leadership positions in the company across geographic regions, as we expect more of the companys growth to come internationally over time. Still, given that the company turned to a company veteran for the CEO role, we didnt expect any major strategic pivots as a result of this change, and think this view has largely played out. We would view staying the course as a wise move for Mastercard.While we attribute the companys strong historical performance primarily to the wide moat that surrounds the business and secular tailwinds, it is notable that Mastercard has generally outperformed Visa in terms of growth in recent years. This suggests management is effectively exploiting the growth opportunities the company has in front of it. Further, we like that management has been hesitant to commit to increasing operating margins over the short term. We believe the company still has significant growth opportunities, and the nature of the business requires reinvestment through the income statement. We think focusing on near-term profitability targets could hamper long-term value creation, and we think management is right to maintain flexibility on this score, although we think the scalability of the business model will allow for margin improvement over time.While Mastercard has completed some acquisitions, they have generally been small and sporadic. We think the companys competitive position argues against aggressive M&A, and we are pleased that management has shown discipline in this regard.Management returns the bulk of Mastercards profitability to shareholders. Over the last five years, dividends and stock repurchases equated to 96% of free cash flow. We appreciate the companys diligence on this front; the dividend has roughly doubled over the past four years.","Mastercard is the second-largest payment processor in the world, having processed close to over $8 trillion in transactions during 2022. Mastercard operates in over 200 countries and processes transactions in over 150 currencies.","We think Mastercards balance sheet is solid. The company added a small amount of debt to its balance sheet in 2014 and in the years since has steadily increased debt. Still, debt/EBITDA at the end of 2022 was a very reasonable 1.1 times. We wouldnt be surprised to see debt increase a bit more over time, but we would expect Mastercard to retain relatively modest leverage in the long run. The company has shown a relatively limited appetite for M&A, and the business model requires very little balance sheet investment, so management has considerable flexibility. Given the integral nature of Mastercard to the global payment infrastructure, we dont believe management would be eager to get too aggressive with its capital structure. On the other hand, an overly conservative balance sheet structure could impede long-term shareholder returns. In our view, the current amount of leverage strikes a reasonable balance.",MA,Financial Services,388576837632.0,NYQ,2132850.0,USD,410.3299865722656,True,0,397.60000035902954,443.57086596076414,1
24/11/2023,CME Stands To Benefit From Rising Interest Rates as Volatility Returns to Its Markets,CME Group Inc,CME,3,25/10/2023,Michael Miller,216.35,USD,23/11/2023,215.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,C,25/10/2023,"Wide-moat-rated CME group reported solid earnings that were in line with our expectations as the company benefited from strong trading volume in its commodity futures. CMEs net revenue increased 9% from last year but decreased 1.6% from a strong second quarter to $1.34 billion. Meanwhile, the companys earnings per share increased 10.2% to $2.06. As we incorporate these results, we do not plan to materially alter our $215 fair value estimate, and we see shares as roughly fairly valued. Trading revenue, which is the primary driver of CMEs results, rose 8.7% from last year to $1.09 billion, despite one fewer trading day in the quarter. The increase in trading revenue was due to better average pricing, as firmwide average daily volume, or ADV, was effectively flat from last year, with CMEs average rate per contract rising 12% to $0.71. CME benefited from positive mix shift as its more expensive contracts outperformed with energy and agricultural futures ADV rising 15.7% and 18.6%, respectively, to 2.1 million and 1.4 million. While these asset classes make up a smaller percentage of CMEs total volume than its equity or interest rate futures, the average price on these contracts is nearly double the company average. Additionally, while equity futures ADV was down 14.7%, the majority of this decrease came from CMEs smaller and cheaper micro equity futures contracts, which saw a 28.3% decrease to 2.17 million. Results in 2023 are benefiting from unusually large price hikes this year. CME typically increases its prices by 1%-2% per year, assuming stable mix, while this year came in at 4%-5%. While CMEs product mix has gone through a positive shift this quarter, trading volume of individual asset classes can be volatile from quarter to quarter, meaning that this improvement cannot be reliably extrapolated. The benefit of the price hikes should prove more durable, though we do expect future price increases to be closer to the firms historical trend.","CME has assembled a diverse set of derivative products in interest rates, equities, commodities, metals, and foreign currency. Weakness in one product is often offset by strength in another. CME has been able drive trading volume growth by successfully introducing new futures contracts, like the micro E-mini S&P 500 and SOFR futures. CME stands to be a beneficiary of rising rates as increased volatility drives more trading volume in its interest rate futures contracts.","Unlike its peers, CME is still mostly a transactional business, leaving its results more exposed to market forces. The structure of the clearinghouse industry has been criticized in the past and regulatory changes could disrupt CME's business model. The cash fixed income and foreign exchange trading businesses CME acquired during its purchase of NEX have seen stagnant to declining revenue.",14/06/2023,"After two years of disappointing revenue growth, CME Group has enjoyed far more favorable market conditions in 2022 and early 2023 as volatility across multiple asset classes drives increased trading volume. In recent years, the most significant headwind for the company has been the impact that low short-term interest rates had on its interest rate complex, which is its largest source of revenue. When interest rates are expected to stay low there is less need for interest rate hedging and less incentive for speculation, creating a drag on CME's trading volume. With interest rates now well above the 0% rate we saw during much of the past decade, the drag has been removed, benefiting the company's growth.  CME has also benefited from increased retail interest in the equity markets. These markets saw a surge in trading volume in 2020, with equity derivative products seeing a larger and more durable increase. CME's equity index futures business has produced impressive performance as a result, with multiple years of double-digit revenue growth as performance has remained strong since. We do, however, expect volume growth from CME's equity derivatives to decelerate as equity market volatility returns to normal levels. That said, the rise of $0 commissions, changes in investor behavior, the broader adoption of futures by smaller traders, and the success of CME's smaller micro futures will provide a permanent tailwind to CME's equity business, so we do not foresee a full retracement.  CME has a dominant position in many of the contracts that trade in its exchange and is well diversified across multiple product lines. In the long term, we anticipate that the company will continue to benefit from secular growth in the need to hedge commodity, energy, and interest rate exposure. CME also has a history of generating incremental growth through the introduction of new futures contracts, like the micro E-mini S&P 500 contract and bitcoin futures. We also expect the company to enjoy increased operating leverage against its mostly fixed cost structure as revenue increases, providing a tailwind to margins over time. ","CME Group has achieved a Wide Morningstar Economic Moat Rating as a result of its position as a leading venue for trading U.S. futures contracts. More than 95% of U.S. interest rate futures trade on CMEs exchange, the company has exclusive licenses to issue futures contracts on the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq indexes, and the company is the dominant venue for trading WTI oil futures. We see the companys strong competitive advantages allowing the firm to earn excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future. CMEs position in the U.S. futures market has proven durable as attempts by NYSE Liffe and ELX to enter the U.S. interest rate futures market failed to gain traction despite having contracts similar to CMEs. This is because competition among futures exchanges is largely dependent on implicit trading costs and collateral efficiencies, not the transaction fees the exchanges charge themselves. For example, the minimum tick size for CME 10-year treasury futures contracts is $15.625 per contract compared with transaction fees that range from $0.30 to $0.75. Even if another exchange charges less than CME, a 1-tick size worse execution on even a fraction of contracts would wipe out any savings to the customer from lower transaction fees. This gives CME considerable pricing power and has allowed the firm to enjoy an operating margin that has historically been around 60%.The ability to trade on an exchange efficiently is dependent on the amount of liquidity present on the exchange already. This creates powerful network effects as the number of traders that already utilize CMEs exchanges ensures that its contracts have good liquidity, increasing their value to other customers. A potential competitor would need to attract a critical mass of trading volume before it could offer its customers comparable execution to CME, a difficult prospect as its initial user base would need to be willing to accept higher trading costs during the startup process. This process would be even further complicated by CMEs model as a vertically integrated clearinghouse and the restrictiveness of futures contracts. Contracts purchased at CMEs exchanges cannot be closed at another exchange and vice-versa. This keeps CMEs liquidity pools captive to its exchanges and creates additional barriers to potential competitors.The firms clearinghouse also benefits from network effects. If one of CMEs customers fails to settle a contract, the exchange will step in and close out the transaction after seizing the collateral of the defaulted counterparty. Any potential losses by the counterparty are covered by a waterfall structure in which CME first covers the losses up to a certain amount. After CMEs contributions hit their limit, any remaining shortfall is then covered by a guaranty fund paid for by the clearinghouse members or direct assessments on the clearinghouse members. This substantially reduces the systemic risk for investors and helps attract additional trading volume to exchanges. However, like other clearinghouses CMEs potential contribution to the risk pool is limited, with total potential payments capping out at only $250 million. The majority of the potential credit risk is split among the clearinghouse members themselves with the guaranty fund and potential assessments adding up to just under $22 billion at the end of 2020. As a result, the risk mitigation provided to investors is tied to the number and size of the clearinghouse members at a clearinghouse, not just the financial strength of the clearinghouse. Additionally, it is more efficient for collateral purposes for clearinghouse members to participate in as few clearinghouses as possible. This discourages the introduction of new clearinghouses, as a new entrant provides little risk mitigation to its members until it can establish a userbase. This adds additional challenges for a new exchange to enter the market using the same vertically integrated model clearinghouse model as CME. CME also benefits from intangible assets as a result of the companys 27% ownership stake in S&P Dow Jones Indices. In addition to receiving revenue from every S&P 500 license, this ownership stake practically ensures that CME Group has an exclusive license to issue the S&P 500 e-Mini and e-Micro futures contracts. In addition, CMEs position within S&P futures likely contributed to the exchanges ability to attract additional equity index futures license agreements for the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 indexes, which returned to CME Group in 2017. These two futures products are licensed from other exchanges but trade on the CME. It is much more efficient for customers to trade two different equity index futures on the same exchange as this allows futures traders to net their positions out when posting collateral. For example, if a trader opens a long S&P futures position and is short the Nasdaq futures contract on the CME, the exchange can record the offsetting contract positions and reduce the amount of collateral they need to post. Additionally, like other exchanges, CME has been able to increasingly monetize the trading data generated on its exchange. This data is proprietary and is highly valuable to investors. The firm has considerable pricing power for its data services as the lack of competition in many of its products means it is an exclusive source of data. When looking at CMEs ability to generate excess economic returns from its economic moat, we focus on its adjusted returns on invested capital excluding acquisition-related intangibles. While not a regular acquirer, CME has considerable amounts of intangible assets on its balance sheet from its purchases of CBOT and Nymex in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and its more recent purchase of NEX in 2018. CME does not amortize the intangible assets it acquired from CBOT and Nymex, instead choosing to leave them on the balance sheet, inflating its invested capital. Despite this, we do not see a large pool of intangible assets from past acquisitions as impairing our belief that CME has established maintainable competitive advantages in its business model.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for CME Group is Medium. Unlike some of its peers, CME Group's revenue is still primarily transactional with more than 80% of the firms revenue in 2022 coming from trading fees. The amount of trading volume any given futures contract experiences is heavily influenced by the amount of volatility in the underlying asset class. Large spikes in volatility generally lead to higher trading volume for CME while low volatility leads to lower trading volumes. As a result, CMEs revenue from an individual product line can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. However, CME is well diversified across multiple different asset classes, which stabilizes the companys total revenue over longer periods of time. It should also be noted that CMEs revenue is affected by market volatility, not market directionality. The company can benefit from volatility to the downside, creating the potential for countercyclicality in its business.Long term, one of the biggest threats to CME would be if regulators sought to change the companys vertically integrated clearinghouse model. New regulations that force CME to take on a larger share of the risk at its clearinghouse or to separate its clearing business out entirely would have a significant impact on the company. That said, we are not aware of any ongoing efforts to make significant changes to the clearinghouse industry.CME holds limited ESG-related risk, and we do not see this risk as material enough to alter our Uncertainty Rating. CME offers futures contracts tied to oil and other petroleum products on its exchange. This exposes CME to the risk of reduced demand if global oil consumption declines as a result of environmental concerns. However, less than 12% of CME's revenue in 2022 came from its energy futures, which includes its natural gas contracts. Additionally, a meaningful reduction in the world's oil consumption will likely take decades to achieve, giving CME plenty of time to adapt.","In our view, CME Groups capital allocation deserves an Exemplary rating. CMEs balance sheet is strong, with $27.3 billion in equity against only $3.4 billion in long-term debt. CME also has ample liquidity with more than $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of March 2023. There is some latent credit risk in the firms clearinghouse business, and the firms revenue can fluctuate based on market volatility. However, the strength of the firms balance sheet leaves it well positioned to withstand any future issues and gives CME the flexibility to make further organic and inorganic investments into its business.CME typically returns the majority of its operating cash flow to investors in the form of dividend payments. The company uses a relatively unique dividend structure for its generous distributions, in which a regular quarterly dividend is supplemented with an annual discretionary cash payout. We like this structure for CME since it does not commit the company to making excessively large dividend payments and it can simply reduce the size of or eliminate the special distribution if the company needs to conserve capital. Given the potential for volatility in CME's earnings, due to their exposure to market forces, we think this dividend structure is a strong fit for the company. While CME does supplement organic investment with acquisitions, these purchases have historically been rare. The CBOT and Nymex deals were major acquisitions but were completed in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Giving the ensuing crisis, these deals were not well timed. However, combining the best trading products from these competitors was strategically important, and we believe the acquisitions widened the companys moat. While it is possible that CME overpaid for CBOT and Nymex given the timing of the deals, we believe the company has been able to make good use of these assets to increase shareholder value. After an extended period of no major acquisitions, CME Group agreed to purchase the NEX Group for $5.5 billion in 2018 for a combination of shares and cash. We think the deal makes good strategic sense with NEXs fixed-income trading business, BrokerTec, and its collateral optimization services seeming like particularly strong fits for CME given its core strengths. That said, recent results from the acquired business lines have been disappointing, with revenue and volume growth being stagnate despite generally favorable market conditions. We like that CME has a disciplined approach to M&A and its focus on strategic acquisitions. All in all, we believe that strong balance sheet, good distribution policy, and capital investment discipline justify an Exemplary rating for the companys capital allocation. That said, the performance of its NEX acquisition will bear monitoring in the near to medium term.","Based in Chicago, CME Group operates exchanges giving investors, suppliers, and businesses the ability to trade futures and derivatives based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign currencies, energy, metals, and commodities. The CME was founded in 1898 and in 2002 completed its initial public offering. Since then, CME Group has consolidated parts of the industry by merging with crosstown rival, CBOT Holdings in 2007 before acquiring Nymex Holdings in 2008 and NEX in 2018. In addition, the company has a 27% stake in S&P Dow Jones Indices, making the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the exclusive venue to trade and clear S&P futures contracts. Through CMEs acquisition of NEX in 2018 it has also expanded into cash foreign exchange, fixed income trading, and collateral optimization. ","CME Group has a strong balance sheet that will serve as a buffer if a market disruption occurs. The balance sheet also provides the company with the flexibility needed to invest more capital into organic investments or acquisitions if it chooses to do so. At the end of March 2023, the company had equity of $27.4 billion against $3.4 billion in long-term debt. The companys balance sheet is managed conservatively, with a targeted EBITDA/debt ratio of 1 times and a firm goal to keep $700 million in cash on hand at any given time. CME is well above this goal, with more than $1.5 billion on hand at the end of March 2023, giving it a rock-solid balance sheet. As a clearinghouse, CME is obligated to cover the losses of its clearinghouse members in the event of a default. However, CMEs share of potential losses as a clearinghouse is capped at $250 million and the companys balance sheet has more than sufficient liquidity to cover the potential credit risk that comes from the firms clearinghouse activities. CME generally returns most of its operating cash flow in the form of dividend payments. The company does this through a combination of a regular quarterly dividend and a special discretionary distribution it typically makes once per year. We expect the company to maintain its regular dividend for the foreseeable future but note that the size of the special dividend can fluctuate from year to year based on the companys result for the year and what cash it has on hand. Should the company make another major acquisition, like the purchase of NEX, we would anticipate the discretionary portion of CMEs dividend to shrink or be eliminated outright while the company reduces leverage back to its long-term target.",CME,Financial Services,79032205312.0,NMS,2153194.0,USD,216.3500061035156,True,0,207.65752994313297,210.95666673448895,0
24/11/2023,Ajinomoto's Consumer Food and ABF Businesses Carve Out a Narrow Economic Moat,Ajinomoto Co Inc,2802,2,06/11/2023,Jeanie Chen,5560.0,JPY,24/11/2023,4500.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,06/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Ajinomoto posted mixed second-quarter results, with sales up 5.6% (0.6% decline currency neutral) year on year and nearly flat business profits (5% decline). The advanced price hike benefits of the moaty food businesses, particularly in the overseas markets, offset widened profit decline of the functional material, or ABF, and biopharma services businesses, the two growth engines of the groups profits during COVID-19. Contrary to managements confidence in improved healthcare (ABF and biopharma service) demand from the second quarter reiterated just three months ago, the downward revision of healthcare sales and profits points to limited visibility to cyclicality and a business model depending on a few clients, the risks that we have flagged but the market seems to have overlooked. After the recent rally, we view shares, trading at 33% premium to our fair value estimate of JPY 4,500, as overvalued. Our business profit forecast for 2023 is 3% above the guidance. The profit loss in biopharma and persistent weakness in ABF were negative surprises, although management emphasized no change in the long-term growth prospect of the two businesses. It appears that economic slowdown in the U.S. has prompted a major pharma client to accelerate the pace of inventory correction of which Ajinomoto expects to end soon. Likewise, it expects ABF sales will return to its growth path from the January-March quarter when impacts of inventory correction cycle end. Despite attractive growth stories, we are not convinced that decade-long growth of ABF and CDMO of oligonucleotides will last given the industry nature of cyclicality. The biopharma firms may face greater financing obstacles in a high interest rate environment that may slow investment in new drugs and thus CDMO demand.","The restructuring plan to withdraw from or downsize the noncore businesses outside the six areas including seasonings, Asian frozen foods, and healthcare will allow Ajinomoto to lift returns on investment and stay focused on its competitive advantages. Expansion into Asian frozen foods presents growth opportunities in the underserved Western markets, where the rising popularity of Japanese foods works in Ajinomotos favor. Management continues to demonstrate its commitment to improving shareholder returns through dividend hikes and share repurchases.",The economic setback resulting from the coronavirus outbreak could depress consumer spending and deter the company's ambition to accelerate growth by raising value-added sales. Domestic growth is capped by shrinking demand resulting from a declining population; domestic frozen food and coffee businesses are vulnerable to price competition initiated by key players. Recent issues surrounding the moaty consumer product businesses indicate that management lacks a sense of urgency to react to changes in the operating environment.,03/10/2023,"Umami, the fifth basic taste, lays the foundation of Ajinomoto's business, which centers on the research and development of amino acids and related products. Ajinomoto has diversified its business into fields ranging from food to animal nutrition to healthcare by leveraging its research findings of umami and fermentation technologies used for amino acid production. Pursuing growth in the specialty businesses, including consumer foods and aminoscience, is the core tenet of Ajinomoto's long-term strategy. Management intends to improve its product mix and margins by raising the contribution from value-added consumer food and specialty amino acid products while reducing exposure to commoditized products. A growing sense of urgency is reflected in recent acquisition and divestiture activities. To build its core business, several bolt-on acquisitions, including that of U.S. frozen food maker Windsor Quality, have been made and continue to be targeted. Noncore sweetener and lysine assets have been divested. Emerging-market expansion backed by a wide variety of offerings and well-recognized brand names has been a key growth driver. In the core overseas markets, the company has extended the product lineup from the mainstay Ajinomoto to flavor and blended seasonings as well as processed foods tailored for local tastes. It is looking to obtain a top share in the newer frozen food and instant soup categories while expanding lineups of recipe mixes and uncovering latent demand of healthy seasonings by leveraging Ajinomotos umami know-how.","We believe Ajinomotos consumer product and functional material businesses have a narrow moat underpinned by intangible assets and cost advantage. Specifically, the intangible assets exhibited in the consumer product business encompass an entrenched relationship with retailers and brand equity reinforced by its product development capabilities and relative cost strengths. Likewise, the functional material business amasses a narrow moat in intangible assets bolstered by its research and development capabilities and entrenched relationships with not only the clients but also players in the semiconductor value chain. We do not assign a moat to the biopharma service business as we reckon most of the contracts are for drugs under development or in the early stages of clinical trials. However, we consider the moat trend is positive as more contracts will be converted to the commercial stage projects over time when the new drugs are approved. The proprietary technologies could enable Ajinomoto to gain new contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, contracts amid growing demand, although the switching costs remain a hurdle to deter biopharma companies from changing partners.Ajinomoto has grown a rich product portfolio with a wide variety of food offerings including seasonings, instant soup/ noodles, mayonnaise, and frozen foods by leveraging its know-how in umami seasonings and savory flavors. Its commanding lead in seasonings and high market shares in many of the key product categories enable sizable investment in marketing and product development. This helps to fortify its brand equity and makes it a valued partner for retailers. The scale also contributes to a cost advantage. Operating in multiple categories with a trusted name, coupled with consistent new product introduction and marketing investment, has allowed Ajinomoto to develop an entrenched retail relationship in the domestic and some core overseas markets. Ajinomoto has diversified the product portfolio, expanding into more value-added product categories including seasoning mixes, soup, and frozen foods by leveraging its strength in flavor enhancers. Capabilities in developing high-quality and tasty products are bolstered by sizable investment in product and technology innovations. It has constantly spent on average JPY 27 billion per year or more than 2% of its sales on R&D, compared with a 1%-2% of sales of global food peers. Such consistency in quality and investment enables Ajinomoto to secure shelf space for not only established products but also new launches. Its quality is also reflected in the clientele profile. Ajinomoto is a key supplier of MSG and nucleotides to global processed food manufacturers including Nestle and Unilever.Private-label competition is less of a threat in its seasoning business given the importance of the flavor and complexity of fermentation technologies. Its flagship product Hon-Dashi, a bonito-based flavor seasoning, is sold at a price 70% higher than peers compatible products. In contrast, Ajinomoto offers private-label products in the categories where it is not a market leader. For example, it produces frozen foods and mayonnaise as well as prepared foods for 7&I Holdings which operates the convenience store chain 7-Eleven and a major supermarket chain in Japan. To avoid competition with its own branded products, Ajinomoto offers products mimicking the taste of the leading brands. The private-label offerings allow Ajinomoto to reinforce its relationship with a leading food retailer and reap the benefit of the growing convenience-store market in which its core products are not the conventional items to serve the channel.In the overseas markets, Ajinomoto has developed a global footprint and gained strong presence in the emerging markets including Southeast Asia and South America. Its ""Five Stars""Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, and Brazilare its core markets where Ajinomoto has tailored the product portfolios and developed country-specific brands/products to meet the local needs. Despite Nestles aggressive expansion in Southeast Asia, a deep understanding of local tastes developed from the beginning of its entry in 1950s and 60s allows Ajinomoto to penetrate the markets and fend off competition, specifically in the seasonings segment. It has established a commanding lead with an 80% and a 70% share in Thailand and Brazils seasoning powder/cube markets, respectively, and claims more than half of the markets for the same category in Vietnam and Indonesia.We think Ajinomoto has an edge to its Western peers in Southeast Asia because its home market shares some common food cultures, having rice as a staple and using various seasonings extracted from fermented foods. Preferences for Japanese brands, a trend prevailing in many Asian countries as Japanese quality is highly regarded, also benefit its brand equity in the region.We believe Ajinomoto possesses a cost advantage derived from scale, self-supply of key ingredients used for the seasoning products, and a global production and distribution network. It is one of very few Japanese packaged food companies that earn a double-digit profit margin (for seasonings and processed food) in the home market thanks to a dominant position in flavor seasonings (more than a 50% share) and large shares in many processed food categories it operates. Self-supply of key seasoning ingredients produced in large quantity also helps lower sourcing costs. Ajinomoto holds leading shares in the global MSG and nucleotide markets and supplies 20% and 25% of global demand.A global production and distribution network with facilities across four continents not only reduces logistic costs but enables overseas sourcing and processing of ingredients supplied to Japans frozen and processed foods. The cost advantage is particularly noticeable for the seasoning and processed food products which generate an impressive low-teen margin groupwide, a rare case among Japanese food companies whose margins mostly range between low and high single digits.Similarly, we consider the functional materials, mainly Ajinomoto built-up film, or ABF, used for semiconductor package substrates, earns a narrow moat with a moat source stemming from intangible assets. Ajinomoto holds a dominant 96% share in the oligopoly built-up film market. The proprietary technologies and customized products have allowed Ajinomoto to cultivate meaningful client relationships and build a loyal customer base. The patent protected technologies allow Ajinomoto to enjoy rapid margin expansion, with business profit (gross profits  selling, general and administrative expenses) margin rising to 50%-plus from 20%-plus during COVID-19 when server/network demand surged. Moreover, the rise of high-performance computing for artificial intelligence applications will lift demand for substrates employing ABF as increased layers of chips will require more film usage. The trend will warrant ABF volume growth.We acknowledge the risk that ABF may become obsolete if new chip designs or substrate package technologies no longer require the build-up film. However, the development of new technologies turning into an industry norm is likely to take years that we believe ABF will be able to earn excessive returns for the next decade. We do not think the business warrant a wide moat as the demand for film largely hinges on advancement of semiconductor technologies. Ajinomoto has been leveraging relationships with existing clients and business partners to be involved in projects around the next generation technologies. It has joined the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network, a consortium led by NTT, Intel, and Sony working on innovations in future data and information processing infrastructure. While Ajinomoto may be able to develop new materials meeting the needs of the new technologies, it does not guarantee Ajinomoto the same competitive edge as it does in ABF when entering a new phase of competition.We do not assign a moat to Ajinomotos biopharma service business, currently accounting for mere 5% of group sales and comprising mainly small molecule drugs, CDMO, and antibody culture media. While disclosure is fairly limited, we reckon that most of contracts acquired recently are for new drugs in the early phases of the development process, rather than the commercial-stage manufacturing contracts for approved drugs, one of the key criteria for having a moat. Yet, we consider the business has a potential to earn a moat. It has been undergoing major transformation which accelerates growth of the value-accretive CDMO business of oligonucleotide drugs and culture media for regenerative medicine. The number of approved new drugs should also increase over time. A growing percentage of the revenue will come from the long-term contracts of approved drugs as time go by. Ajinomoto has developed a proprietary liquid-phase method Ajiphase which allows synthesis of oligonucleotide drugs in large volume, as opposed to the mainstream solid phase synthesis in small lots. Ajinomotos method will significantly lower the production costs of large-volume orders. Moreover, it requires little extra capital expenditure as the production facilities of small molecule drugs can be easily converted to lines manufacturing oligonucleotide drugs. Growth of the oligonucleotide CDMO market has taken off in 2022 with more drugs in the pipelines globally. Yet, lacking track records will be a major near-term obstacle to hinder pharmaceutical companies switch to Ajinomoto from the existing partners although we think such a disadvantage can be overcome in due course if rivals fail to enhance cost efficiency or quality.","We assign Ajinomoto a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The major risks it faces include volatility in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and pricing environment of the domestic and core overseas markets. Amino acids production consumes large amounts of raw materials and energy input during the fermentation process. Soft commodities employed vary by geographic locations and make up more than 40% of cost of goods sold. Key raw materials include tapioca (Thailand), raw sugar (Brazil), corn (the U.S.), and wheat starch (France). Auxiliary materials such as sulphuric acids and ammonia, and energy inputs, are about one third of production costs and have meaningful impact on profitability.Ajinomoto confronts greater currency-exchange risks than most Japanese food peers because of the exposure to bulk-selling products including MSG, animal nutrition, and amino acids for foods and pharmaceuticals. Sales contracts are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars while costs, on many occasions, are in different currencies.Reputation risk associated with the negative image of MSG in Western markets may thwart expansion into frozen foods in North America and Europe. To avoid dispute, the firm has removed MSG from all the frozen food products launched in North America. In France, however, it preserves MSG because the umami concept appears to be well received by French consumers.Weak consumer sentiment could be detrimental to spending on processed foods as well as premiumization and heightens risks of price wars or consumers downtrading. It could also hamper price hikes when there is a need to pass on higher costs. The bulk-sold commoditized products including MSG and animal nutrition also face risks of price wars, often initiated by Chinese or Korean players when they significantly boost production capacities or desire for share gain. Given the commodity nature, Ajinomoto does not possess pricing power despite its sizable shares.","We assess Ajinomotos Capital Allocation as Standard for a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distribution. Ajinomotos balance sheet is healthy although the debt level has increased considerably between 2015 and 2016 after several acquisition deals. The net debt/EBITDA ratio rose to above 1 time in 2016 and has been trending between 1 and 2 times. We anticipate the ratio to descend to nearly 0.5 time by fiscal 2027 as it continues to divest noncore assets including cross-holding shares, while profits should continue to rise on the back of growing consumer product sales in emerging markets and healthcare expansion.Capital management has been a priority since former president Masatoshi Ito came on board in 2009. The current management team, led by Takaaki Nishii, has accelerated the divestiture and business transformation process. Rather than focusing on ROE and EPS growth, management has employed return on invested capital, or ROIC, and organic growth, as the key financial performance indicators in its midterm plan.Reorganizing the business portfolio has been a key management initiative over the past few years. It has identified six areas--seasonings, Asian frozen foods, instant nourishing foods, flavor-enhancement ingredients, healthcare, and electronic materials--as the core businesses in which it has strong competitive edges to earn high returns or become a top-three player globally. To strengthen its presence in the core areas, it made several mid to small-size acquisitions, mostly in the overseas foods and advanced biopharmaceutical fields, between 2015 and 2020. Many involved purchases of joint-venture stakes owned by partners or investment in bio or tech ventures. In light of its policy to improve capital efficiency and ROE, management has been increasing leverage by raising debt to finance acquisition deals.Deteriorated profitability in the moaty consumer businesses stemming from intensified competition in 2019 forced management to accelerate the restructuring by unloading assets of the noncore businesses. It has significantly reduced exposure to commoditized bulk-selling businesses, divesting most of the assets of the animal nutrition business and withdrawing from some business-to-business food operations including seasonings and frozen food. Meanwhile, it also sold down more than JPY 60 billion of the cross-holding shares (including the JPY 13 billion worth of shares scheduled for 2021). Management has achieved JPY 214 billion in asset divestiture between 2020 and 2022, doubling the target of JPY 100 billion it has initially set. We foresee some repatriated cash will be used for repaying debt. We think management is on the right path to increase weight of high-margin consumer products. In contrast, given its less impressive record in yielding results from past acquisitions, we think making a large size deal may jeopardize the existing core businesses.We consider Ajinomotos shareholder distribution appropriate but see room to improve its share repurchase programs. Management has set a minimum target to return 50% of earnings to shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. While it has hiked dividends by nearly 30% in 2020 and raised the payout target ratio to 40%, we are skeptical that buying back shares at a significant premium will lead to increased shareholder returns. It had consistently bought back shares, on average JPY 30 billion per year, between 2019 and 2022, and has bought back up to JPY 50 billion of shares between May 2023 and the end of July 2023. Given an increased proportion of shareholder returns in a form of dividends, we project the share repurchase of JPY 40 billion-JPY 45 billion will take place every year unless earnings greatly exceed managements expectation.","Ajinomoto is Japans leading food company specializing in amino acids and seasonings derived from amino acid fermentation technologies. It also produces processed foods including dry soup mixes, frozen foods, and beverage products. Apart from the consumer business, it is a key supplier of MSG and nucleotides to global food manufacturers including Nestle. The food business represents nearly three fourths of group sales and 80%-plus of profits with nearly two thirds generated overseas. Healthcare and function materials (mainly Ajinomoto build-up film, or ABF), the key growth drivers through 2030, make up the balance of its business portfolio. The nonfood businesses are expected to contribute half of the group profits by 2030, boosted by ABF and CDMO growth.","Ajinomotos free cash flow has been positive over the past decade excluding the impact of transfer of partial employee benefits relating to the pension fund in 2013. We expect free cash flow will stay positive over our five-year explicit forecast period. Apart from relatively steady earnings generated from the consumer product business, the restructuring efforts centering on divestiture of the low-return asset-intensive businesses cap investment cash outflow. Moreover, the robust semiconductor demand should bolster the profits of the electronic materials (ABF) business through 2023. We thus anticipate returns on invested capital will improve along with asset divestitures and stay well above the level of the weighted average cost of capital, thanks to growth in the lucrative seasonings and ABF businesses as well as rising healthcare contribution. Capital expenditure is expected to reach JPY 210 billion for a three-year period-ended 2022 exclusive of budget for acquisitions. Major investments include expansion of production capabilities for overseas foods, mainly in Southeast Asia and North America, consolidation and upgrade of domestic food production lines, as well as expansion of biopharmaceutical and regenerative medicine.Debt financing has been a major means to fund acquisition deals, which has driven the debt/equity ratio to above 0.5 times (0.23 times excluding 75% of cash), which have moved within a narrow range since 2016. Management has indicated interest in overseas food, flavor and fragrance, and advanced biomedical fields as potential acquisition targets and set aside a budget of, but not limited to, JPY 80 billion with a target leverage level at 0.5 times net debt/equity for the current midterm plan ending March 2024. We do not expect management to engage in large-scale deals given the focus on transitioning to an asset-light business model over the next three years.",2802.T,Consumer Defensive,2850323431424.0,JPX,1469900.0,JPY,5560.0,True,0,5755.926829268293,5626.291139240507,0
24/11/2023,Paycom Continues to Enjoy Sticky Customers Despite Module Adoption Headwinds,Paycom Software Inc,PAYC,5,01/11/2023,Emma Williams,177.5,USD,23/11/2023,295.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,01/11/2023,"We lower our fair value estimate for Paycom to $295 from $370 per share following the release of mixed third-quarter results and underwhelming preliminary guidance for fiscal 2024. Paycom is facing ongoing difficulty converting the remaining third of existing clients to the firms flagship self-service payroll solution, Beti, while simultaneously facing headwinds from nonrecurring service revenue cannibalization. Following the result, we have lowered our long-term revenue per client assumptions, dragging on both top-line growth and profitability expectations. While the outlook has soured for Paycom, we continue to believe the business benefits from high customer switching costs underpinning our narrow moat rating, and we view the firm as well placed to take a further share of the expansive payroll and HCM market. Despite a sharp fall post-release as low as $166, Paycom shares remain attractive relative to our updated fair value estimate. Paycoms laser focus on driving automation and self-service payroll appears to have become a double-edged sword for the firm. Beti continues to be a key drawcard for new clients looking to reduce costly payroll errors and improve efficiency and has supported stickier clients and margin uplift for Paycom. However, increased accuracy through automation and employee engagement has been at the expense of Paycom's revenue tied to ad hoc payroll correction services. Simultaneously, conversion resistance among remaining clients appears increasingly structural, and we now expect Paycom will need to service duplicate payroll platforms and enjoy lower module adoption over the long term, limiting operating leverage relative to our prior forecasts.","We expect increasing employee usage and employee self service will entrench Paycom's platform further into a client's business, increasing client stickiness. Increasing regulatory complexity under a U.S. Democratic Administration should create tailwinds for the payroll and HCM industry. Paycom's employee self-service payroll Beti is innovating amid an industry shift toward greater employee usage and the consumerization of payroll and HR software.","We expect fierce competitive pressures to limit pricing growth and force Paycom to maintain high investment in software development and innovation. We view Paycom's offerings as largely commoditized, exposing the company to higher risk of pricing pressure. While Paycom has achieved success moving upmarket, we expect mega enterprises will continue to prefer to integrate best-of-breed solutions. ",01/11/2023,"Paycom's unified platform appeals to midsize and enterprise clients that prefer an all-in-one payroll and human capital management, or HCM, solution. The company's platform is supported by a single database, which provides a single source of truth and allows efficient software development and maintenance. Unlike competitors, Paycom discourages data integrations to third-party providers but instead incentivizes clients to contain their HCM solutions within its unified platform by offering add-on modules, including time and attendance and benefits administration. In practice, new clients may consolidate their payroll and HCM solutions from multiple providers to an all-in-one solution by Paycom. The company is squarely focused on driving greater automation and employee self-service, supported by complementary analytics tools for clients and the rollout of its self-service payroll module Better Employee Transaction Interface, or Beti.  We expect Paycom will continue to take market share of the growing payroll and HCM industry through industry consolidation and capitalizing on the shortfalls of competitors. The company has reported impressive growth to date, reflecting an ability to win clients and demonstrating how the cost and efficiency benefits of streamlining payroll and HCM solutions to a single platform can overcome inherent client switching costs.  We anticipate Paycom's average revenue per client, or ARPC, will increase at an average rate of 6% to 2027 due to a gradual shift upmarket and from taking greater share of wallet through upselling existing and new modules. Paycom's target market has shifted upward over several years, with the company formally lifting the upper bound to over 10,000 employees in fiscal 2023, from 2,000 in fiscal 2013. While we expect Paycom's average client size to increase, we expect its offering to be less appealing to mega enterprises that typically prefer to integrate best-of-breed solutions, in our view limiting the upmarket upside for Paycom.","Paycom has garnered a narrow economic moat underpinned by high customer switching costs. Paycom also benefits from intangible brand assets, in our view, based on a growing track record of performance. While dominant provider ADP has invested heavily over the past decade to remain competitive on functionality, nascent providers like Paycom have been able to capitalize on that company's shortfalls and capture market share through the appeal of its nimble, unified, and user-friendly platform. As a result, Paycom's client base grew at a CAGR of 12% to about 19,000 clients over the 10 years to fiscal 2022, outpacing ADPs growth of about midsingle digits over the same period. To remain competitive and capture further share, we expect Paycom will need to continue to invest in internal software development to expand its portfolio of modules to meet changing client needs, as well a maintained investment in marketing. In addition, we expect the company will face pricing pressure from an increasingly competitive operating environment. Despite this, we are comfortable that Paycom will be able to earn maintainable economic profits for at least the next 10 years. Paycom holds a minority but fast-growing share of the U.S. payroll and HCM market. The company reports an estimated 5% market share across its 50-10,000 employee client target market. On a more granular basis, we estimate 75% of its client base are in the 50-999 employees midsize market, representing an estimated market share of 6%. This compares with ADP and Paychex's midsize market share of about 30% and 14%, respectively. We estimate a further 5% of Paycom's client base is in the 1,000-plus employee enterprise market, representing an estimated market share of 9%, compared with about 23% for ADP. We assume the remaining share of clients is in the highly fragmented one to 49 employees small-business market, representing an estimated market share of less than 1%. This compares with Paychex and ADP's estimated small-business market share of about 11% and 12%, respectively. Approximately 65% of the small-business market is serviced by regional providers or do-it-yourself solutions using software such as Intuit's QuickBooks or Microsoft Excel, creating meaningful scope for greater penetration. While Paycom has ramped up its efforts to target the small-business market, we expect most future client growth to come from taking share in the enterprise market, leading to high-single-digit growth in revenue per client. We expect Paycom's value proposition to resonate more with larger companies looking to automate and reduce duplication of large volumes of processes and tasks.Paycom offers a range of payroll and HCM solutions via its unified, cloud-based platform supported by a single database. This platform infrastructure is scalable, can be efficiently maintained and modified, and supports a streamlined user experience without the need for integration to separate platforms or databases. Paycom has developed ancillary HCM modules, including time and attendance, talent management, and benefits administration software within the platform to complement its core payroll solutions adopted by all clients. In recent years, Paycom has deployed features that accelerate its efforts to drive automation and employee self-service, and to reduce redundant processes within a client's business. In practice, this means an employee can have direct access to the HCM database and can fulfill data entry tasks previously undertaken by a payroll or HR department. Such features include employee self-service payroll, Beti, and Direct Data Exchange which measures employee usage and reports on current and potential cost savings and efficiency gains. While self-service functionality and automation is growing across payroll and HCM peers, we believe Paycom is pushing the envelope with employee self-service payroll. However, the industry is highly competitive, and we expect such innovations will be replicated by competitors over time and is therefore not a maintainable source of competitive advantage. As with payroll and HCM peers, Paycom benefits from high customer switching costs. Payroll and HCM software is typically deeply embedded in a business' operations, making it a costly and time intensive process to switch providers. Alongside monetary costs, a business could face operational disruptions and inefficiencies including having to train employees on the new system, integrate the new solution with other software and risk losing data. Despite operating in a highly competitive environment, Paycom had revenue retention of 93% in fiscal 2022, in line with a 93% four-year average from fiscal 2019. Assuming minimal annual price increases, this implies an average client life span of about 15 years. We expect Paycom's strategic focus on employee self-service and employee usage has increased the stickiness of its clients, supporting an improvement in revenue retention. By shifting responsibility for data entry from a HR department to the client's employees and encouraging employee engagement with the software, we expect Paycom's product offering has become more entrenched in the client's business. Over the long run, we expect Paycom will continue to invest in software development and delivering high grade user experience to maintain high retention rates. Maintaining high customer retention rates allows Paycom to earn a steady stream of recurring revenue at a low marginal cost. We expect Paycom's reputation for delivering reliable and compliant solutions over the past two decades is supporting their ability to win market share. Payroll is a highly sensitive, complex and mission critical operation for all businesses that place high value on reliability, accuracy, compliance and data security. The potential ramifications for a business from failing to make payroll on time or accurately, being non-compliant with the applicable laws or breaching data security can be severe. While we view product innovation as key to remaining competitive, a payroll and HCM provider's ability to deliver reliable and compliant solutions is paramount. We view the brand equity of legacy providers as stronger relative to new entrants, owing to their to their longer operating histories and larger scale. Nonetheless, Paycom is at an advantage to newer entrants lacking a track record of performance, in our view. ","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Paycom. While the company has diversified its revenue across payroll and HCM solutions, it remains nonetheless exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets. Our rating is also influenced by upside uncertainty, as we expect Paycom to benefit from industry tailwinds during an economic boom including higher pays per client, greater demand for solutions to recruit, retain and manage employee and higher yields of client funds. Paycom's environmental, social and governance risk is low. Paycom handles high volumes of sensitive, personally identifiable information for its customers and their employees, exposing the company to data privacy and security risk, however we view this risk as low and immaterial to our uncertainty rating. If a data security breach or breaching of data privacy laws was to occur, Paycom would be exposed to regulatory fines, civil lawsuits and/or reputational damage. Paycom has moderate data privacy and security measures in place including external certifications and industry standard security protection technologies. While we view Paycom's procedures as less robust than competitor ADP, the company has had no material data privacy or security breaches. Though this provides some comfort, there is scope for Paycom to improve its procedures including through adopting binding corporate rules aligned to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that has become a baseline for global best practice for personal data protection and appointing executive management responsibility for data privacy and security. ","We assign Paycom an Exemplary Morningstar capital allocation rating based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investment efficacy, and mostly appropriate shareholder distributions. Paycom's balance sheet is sound. Aside from a portfolio of company-owned office buildings and data centers, Paycom operates a capital-light business model with strong free cash flow generation potential and typically boasts a net cash position. While Paycom does not rule out acquisitions, it has widened scale and built out its portfolio of HCM modules exclusively through organic investments to date. We expect Paycom could comfortably increase gearing to support further investment in internally generated software, or for tuck-in acquisitions. Given the uncertainty around timing and pricing, we do not explicitly forecast acquisitions. In the absence of attractive acquisition targets or internal investment opportunities, we would expect Paycom to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends or increasing share repurchases. We assess Paycom's investment efficacy as exceptional. Through investment in internally generated software, Paycom has built out a portfolio of HCM modules and tools that encourage increased employee usage, automation, and reduce duplicative processes resulting in cost and operational efficiencies for its clients. The added features have been well received by clients, have resulted in increased employee self-service, and we think this has increased client stickiness, as reflected in the uplift in revenue retention. We anticipate the rollout of employee self service payroll Beti from fiscal 2021 onward will face similar success, driving greater employee usage and entrenching Paycom's solution further into clients' businesses. Through internal investment and potential tuck-in acquisitions, we expect Paycom will continue to expand its suite of HCM software to remain competitive and take greater share of clients' wallets. Paycom's shareholder distributions are mostly appropriate. The company has returned nearly $590 million to shareholders over the seven years to fiscal 2022 through share repurchases. As a portion of these repurchases were executed at share prices above our fair value estimate, we would have preferred shareholder capital was either distributed through dividends or reinvested in the business. We expect Paycom to continue to repurchase shares under an ongoing buyback plan, but this will be partly offset by share issuance under employee-purchase and compensation plans.

As of August 2023, the company has access to a $1 billion revolving line of credit and a term loan of up to $750 million. Under these agreements, Paycom is subject to certain operating and financial covenants including restrictions on incurring further debt and issuing distributions. We expect Paycom to maintain a net cash position, to comfortably cover interest on outstanding debt, and to remain compliant with these covenants over our forecast period. Paycom pays a regular quarterly dividend in addition to returning capital to shareholders through an ongoing share repurchase program.

24/11/2023,Wide-Moat Veeva Has Plenty of Runway for Growth From Wide Offerings and New Customer Wins,Veeva Systems Inc,VEEV,4,10/11/2023,Keonhee Kim,175.71,USD,23/11/2023,267.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,10/11/2023,"Wide-moat Veeva hosted an investor day and discussed certain near-term challenges as well as new product innovation that further bolsters the firms wide portfolio of products. After updating our model, we lightly cut our fair value estimate to $267 from $275. A difficult environment caused by high interest rates and limited funding in the biotechnology space, which we have called out during the past few earnings seasons, is trending worse than management had initially anticipated. We think this, coupled with pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Sanofi announcing cost-cutting measures, will weigh on Veevas professional services segment in the upcoming quarters. For context, Veevas services business comprises implementation and deployment services, technical consulting, and product training. Pulling back on such services offers an easy way for biopharmaceutical firms to reduce spending, and we expect Veeva to be caught in the middle of this industrywide tide. Management slightly trimmed its sales guidance for services for the fourth quarter and total sales for fiscal 2025 to at least $2.75 billion from at least $2.80 billion, with most of the impact coming from its lowered services outlook. But despite the challenges the services segment is expected to face, we believe the impact on the subscription side will be much more muted. We think many applications that Veeva offers are mission-critical and customers are unwilling to let go of these products even in a challenging environment, substantiating Veevas resilience. Moving on to the more positive news from the investor day, Veeva announced Veeva Pulse, a new data product that is generated by Veevas applications, with a commercial rollout in 2025. This is yet another product that the firm introduced in its data cloud, recently complemented with the introduction of Compass Prescriber and Compass National, two products that will be available in early 2024.","Veeva Vault continues to implement new products to its suite, which makes the offering even more attractive. Focusing on new verticals like medical devices and diagnostics companies and consumer products and chemical industries opens up new end markets and opportunities. Veevas institutional knowledge and codevelopment partnerships with customers enable the company to develop robust offerings addressing market needs.",Moving its CRM from Salesforces platform to its Vault Platform could raise concerns for customers and lower its retention rate. Moving into new verticals like medical devices and diagnostics companies and consumer products and chemical industries could be moat dilutive due to Veevas lack of experience in the space. New modules or add-ons could show low penetration rate and win less customers compared with previously launched products.,19/10/2023,"Veeva is the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions tailored to the life sciences industry. It provides an ecosystem of products to address the operating challenges and regulatory requirements that companies in the space face. Instead of focusing on a general, one-size-fits-all system, Veeva has created platforms that are purely designed to serve one industry. And this vertical focus has allowed the company to shape its products for its specific customers to fit their specific needs. Veeva is deeply penetrated in its addressable market, and its continued expanding portfolio of applications presents itself as one of the most attractive offerings in the space.  The company operates in two categories: commercial solutions and R&D solutions. Commercial solutions entails vertically integrated customer relationship management, or CRM, services and end-market data and analytics solutions mainly through its CRM and add-ons. Veeva CRM is Veevas cloud-based customer relationship management platform that markets to pharmaceutical and biotech companies with commercial needs. CRM was originally built on the Salesforce 1 platform, but Veeva announced in late 2022 that it will migrate the product to its own Vault platform. Customer migration will begin in 2024 and existing users can use CRM on Salesforces platform until 2030. We believe Veevas Vault platform is well developed to easily handle both CRM and R&D applications, and this move away from Salesforce gives the firm the independence to run all its offerings. R&D solutions horizontally integrates data and content through Veeva Vault. Veeva Vault is Veevas content management system that is built on the companys own platform and it is industrys first tool that offers all applications in a unified and integrated server. It is a suite of applications that aims to help across 5 specific functions (commercial, clinical, regulatory, quality and manufacturing, and safety) within any company that is developing drugs or suppliers to those who are developing drugs. ","We assign Veeva a wide moat rating because we believe the firms high retention rate and its customers unlikeliness to move to a different product (switching costs) should continue to support economic profits for at least the next 20 years. Veeva is the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions specific to the life sciences industry. Instead of focusing on a general, one-size-fits-all system, Veeva has created a platform that is purely designed to serve one industry. With over 15 years of experience, Veeva has amassed industry-specific knowledge that it utilizes to tailor its products for specific customers. Veeva is well penetrated in its addressable market, and its continued expanding portfolio of applications presents itself as one of the most attractive offerings in the space. Veevas adjusted ROIC was above 70% in fiscal year 2022 which surmounts its WACC of 7.5%. We assign Veevas commercial solutions a wide moat based on customer switching costs. Veeva CRM is Veevas cloud-based customer relationship management platform. It markets to pharmaceutical and biotech companies that have already underwent drug development processes and have a salesforce for their products. Prior to Veeva, life sciences companies with commercial needs relied on either generic one-size-fits-all cloud offerings or client- or server-specific systems. Generic CRMs didnt have the capabilities to react quickly to business and regulatory changes, and aging client- or server-specific systems were slow to update since any new application that launched had to be compatible with each individual server. This made upkeep costly and time-consuming. Veeva CRM solves these issues by offering a cloud-based server that is specifically tailored to life sciences industry. Since its core CRM and all of its add-ons run on salesforce.com, updates to old applications or new product launches can go live to all of its clients swiftly. Customers are able to always run the latest version while avoiding high up-front costs, lengthy installations, and painful upgrade cycles. As a first mover in a niche space, Veeva faces little competition, and has already established itself as the global standard for life sciences CRM. Also, since Veeva is vertically focused in one specific industry, its depth of knowledge and experience in the space is very difficult to replicate for any generic CRM provider. This is supported by the lions share of the CRM market that Veeva has attained over the years. In 2013, about a third of the global pharmaceutical sales representatives were using Veeva CRM, but that number has increased to over 80% by 2022. And Veeva has been successful at increasing market share on this front quarter over quarter, every single quarter consistently.Once users are fully acclimated to Veevas CRM and the system is fully integrated into a companys operating activities, the direct time and expense of switching to a competing software solution is high and comes with substantial operating risks. The downside risk of switching is expansive and could result in loss of data in the migration process, temporary disruption to sales activities, or even ultimately delay product launches. This is especially damaging for life sciences industry where time to market is more important than other industries because it is very time-intensive to develop drugs and patent duration is limited. Furthermore, users get stickier and switching costs rise as more add-ons are purchased. Beyond the core CRM, Veeva offers many complementary applications to existing customers, growing value per contract while keeping customer acquisition costs manageable. In aggregate, average add-on penetration rate was less than 10% in 2015 but this figure has grown to 50-60% by 2021. So Veeva has been very successful at initially winning over customers with its core CRM offerings, then upgrading them to multichannel users with its suite of applications. Thus, the increased adoption of complementary Veeva products, some of which house critical drug data, creates even stickier customer relationships. As a firms salesforce becomes accustomed to using Veevas software, switching costs rise, especially given the centrality of the platform to a firms sales and marketing efforts.We assign Veevas R&D solutions a wide moat based on customer switching costs. Started in 2011, Veeva Vault is Veevas content management system that is built on the companys own platform. It tackles five specific functions within a life sciences company: commercial, clinical trials, quality and manufacturing, regulatory, and pharmacovigilance (safety). And within each functional area, Veeva offers a suite of applications that helps its customers to be more efficient. Since Vault is a unified system, every application is fully integrated into the main platform and transitioning from one channel to another is seamless. No one in the industry has previously offered all of the applications that Vault offers on a unified platform, so Veeva was able to enter the market and penetrate it without much competition. Since its launch, Vault has seen impressive growth in the number of customers year over year. Similar to Veeva CRM, Vault has also been able to catch on with its users effectively and turn them from single-application users to multichannel users. Since Vault spans multiple functions within a life sciences company, there are many different end markets that Veeva can enter. Within Vaults suite of applications, some products are complementary and others are designed to solve issues in different silos. We see Vault users purchasing more applications within the platform as they spend more time with Veeva. This carries nicely over to Veevas top line since as the number of years that customers have been using Vault increases, so does the annualized Vault subscription revenue. Overall, Veeva has become the leading global standard in cloud-service offerings for the life sciences industry. Fifteen years after its founding, Veeva already dominates the CRM space and is deeply penetrated in top companies. In 2014, Veeva CRM and Vault commercial were being used by four of the top 50 companies in the industry Veeva serves. By 2018, that number increased to 19 out of the top 20 companies, and we assume a majority of the top 50 companies are using the two platforms. Vault clinical, which only started in the early 2010s, had four out of the top 20 companies in 2015 but that number doubled only three years later. And Veeva not just dominates the top players but it dominates the entire industry. That encompasses major pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical companies as well as emerging growth companies. In a study that ranks how much money life sciences companies spend on cloud software vendors, Veeva broke into the top 10 spot in 2012. Just five years later, Veeva ranked number one on the list. This wouldn'tt have been possible if Veeva solely focused on its core CRM product and its add-ons. Veevas continued investments into other areas within the organization and product launches with success have helped materialize this win for the company. This shows the tremendous growth trajectory that Veeva has been able to maintain. And this level of brand reputation and trust within the industry could not have been achieved without a consistent track record of success and history of delivering market-leading innovation.","We assign Veeva a High uncertainty rating, which largely reflects our quantitative analysis of the firm based on the return ranges used by our star rating system and somewhat concerns around a difficult macroenvironment. Veeva CRM makes up roughly one third of the firms total sales, and many new customer wins come from small and medium-sized biotechnology firms since the majority of top 50 pharma companies have already adopted the solution. But 2023 has been a tough year for many biotech firms due to limited funding in the industry and high interest rates. While this potentially raises concerns, Veeva still has managed to win new customers, which we attribute to its resilience and importance in the industry. Another risk that Veeva faces in the near to medium term is its ability to fully migrate over its customer base from CRM built on the Salesforce platform to Vault CRM. In 2022, the firm announced that it decided to not renegotiate its contract with Salesforce and instead run CRM on the Vault platform. Management believed that Vault is now a mature product and there are many benefits from running all of its products, now CRM included, under its own platform. Most of the migration work will be on the back end, customers shouldnt see any major changes from their end. And Veeva has shown a proven track record of strong customer retention rate and strong customer penetration. We believe the migration process will go smoothly and should not raise any major concerns, but there still is a possibility for issues that could affect the transition. ","After taking a fresh look, we upgrade Veevas capital allocation rating to Exemplary from Standard. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Exemplary rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We view Veevas balance sheet as sound. Factors that are considered include unleveraged business risk and balance sheet risk. We view Veevas business risk as low due to its sticky revenue stream. Veevas contracts are on annual basis, and the company boasts above-100% revenue retention rate year over year. Also, we view its client base as economically non-cyclical. Life sciences companies, customers that drive roughly 90% of Veevas overall sales, are fairly resistant to recessionary periods because people need drugs regardless of economic conditions, which help their revenue stream to be relatively consistent. And they, on average, spend 3% of their overall market size on IT and software year over year. So we believe that they are more than likely to resubscribe to Veevas products, which keeps Veevas revenue cyclicity low. We also view Veevas balance sheet risk as low since the company has no debt. It also has a great cash and equivalents balance ($1.14b as of fiscal year 2022) and consistently generates strong cash flow from operations to cover any potential debt in the future. We view Veevas investments strategy as exceptional. Veevas internal investments add depth to its product offerings and its customers have enjoyed these additions. Over the last five years, the company has consistently spent roughly 20% of its total sales on R&D to expand its suite of applications. And customers have adopted well to utilize these additions  the average number of products per user for commercial cloud and Vault over the last five years increased from 2.91 to 4.02 and 2.10 to 2.71, respectively. Veevas external investments have historically been small complementary software tuck-ins. In 2019, the company made two small strategic acquisitions: the $427 million purchase of Crossix (privacy-safe patient data and analytics) and the $55 million purchase of Physicians World (live and virtual event logistics). These tuck-ins add to its Commercial Cloud offerings and are complementary to the mission-critical operations (CRM) involved in drug commercialization. Following the investment, Veeva retained a wide margin of excess returns on invested capital. We view Veevas shareholder distribution as appropriate. The company does not pay a dividend, similar to Salesforce (largest CRM software provider) and IQVIA (biggest direct competitor in the biotech/pharma CRM space). This is also appropriate since Veeva is a fast-growing company and its liquidity allows it the ability to maintain its aggressive growth.In February 2021, Veeva became the first public U.S. company to reincorporate as a public benefit company. While it will remain a for-profit corporation, it is also now legally responsible to the interests of stakeholders beyond shareholdersemployees, customers, and society as a whole. Functionally, company operations will remain unchanged and shareholders retain their protections (such as election of directors and proxy votes). The primary benefit to operating under this structure is a reduction of legal risk from shareholders; when making operating decisions considering other stakeholders that may not exclusively benefit investors, these actions are justified. The proxy vote received over 99% support from shareholders, suggesting that investors consider this a negligible risk factor and have a high degree of confidence in management to continue to be excellent stewards. ","Veeva is the global leading supplier of cloud-based software solutions for the life sciences industry. The companys best-of-breed offerings address operating and regulatory requirements for customers ranging from small, emerging biotechnology companies to departments of global pharmaceutical manufacturers. The company leverages its domain expertise to improve the efficiency and compliance of the underserved life sciences industry, displacing large, highly customized and dated enterprise resource planning systems that have limited flexibility. Its two main products are Veeva CRM, a customer relationship management platform for companies with a salesforce, and Veeva Vault, a content management platform that tackles various functions within any life sciences company.","We believe Veeva is in great financial health. Veeva currently has no debt and it generates strong cash flow year over year to cover any potential debt in the future. The company has a strong cash and equivalents balance of roughly $900 million as of fiscal year 2023, and we expect the trend of no/low debt and deep pockets of cash to continue over the next five years. From our perspective, management has been disciplined about M&A and taking on debt. The 2019 acquisition of Crossix was the firms largest to date, at approximately $430 million. We assume the company will continue make small tuck-in acquisitions and fund them through available cash and cash flow from operations. Even in this scenario, we forecast increasing liquidity, as the firms reserve of cash should continue to increase.",VEEV,Healthcare,28731717632.0,NYQ,1319461.0,USD,175.7100067138672,True,1,197.88082401050707,203.97543127741974,1
24/11/2023,SBA Is Well Positioned in the U.S. and Has the Potential to Boost Growth in International Markets,SBA Communications Corp,SBAC,4,03/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,233.21,USD,23/11/2023,260.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,03/11/2023,"SBAs third-quarter results showed very little impact from the reduced network investment among U.S. wireless carriers, and we maintain that fears of a dramatic tower business deterioration are unfounded. We expect the slowdown in carrier spending will be only slightly more apparent in 2024. While SBA continued operating its business well in the third quarter, it finallyin our viewchose to buy back shares at the right time. SBA has not been our favorite tower stock over the past several years, but we are increasingly pleased with how management is running the business, and we think, even after a big bounce off the recent lows, the stock is materially undervalued. Were maintaining our $260 fair value estimate. In the U.S., same-tower sales growth stayed close to 5% in the quarter despite tower decommissioning from Sprint that we suspect shaved more than 1 percentage point of growth. As with its peers, SBA confirmed the slower carrier spending environment and said its customer backlog is down. We project a slowdown in same-tower sales growth in 2024, when Sprint churn should remain at a similar level to 2023. However, between fixed annual escalators, some master lease agreements that require incremental annual investment, potential upside from Dish, and the amount of spectrum that major carriers still have not deployed, we expect same-tower sales growth will stay above 3% annually throughout our five-year forecast despite a modest level of Sprint churn occurring each year through 2026. Management was more enthusiastic about international markets, saying customers were more active than they expected. We dont yet see this pickup in the results, as the 5% international same-tower sales growth was generally in line with what we expected, but it should bode well for future quarters.","Carrier investment in towers will have to continue as mobile data usage continues to grow rapidly. Greater use of the Internet of Things, 5G, and video content should keep this trend in place for years to come.  Wireless network development in SBAs international markets is behind the U.S. and will require more tower investment by carriers as they transition to broad 4G and then 5G coverage. Long-term carrier leases with built-in escalators leave SBA with great visibility into its continued revenue growth and provide a floor to financial results.
","The companys extreme use of financial leverage could become problematic if the company were to face an industry downturn or a less favorable economic environment. Technological advances, less new spectrum to deploy, and a rolling off of Sprint contracts will keep U.S. growth below historical levels for the next several years.  SBA has an extremely concentrated customer base, leaving it overly susceptible to carrier bankruptcies or consolidation, both of which would likely reduce carrier investment. ",03/11/2023,"SBA focuses exclusively on towers and has some geographic diversification, but we think its strategy to use very high financial leverage for stock buyback purposes provides unnecessary risk and ultimately keeps it from deepening its presence in several of its developing markets. That said, we like its business and think it will continue to grow at a fast clip, albeit not to the same extent as rival American Tower. The tower business is very attractive. We dont think there will be any change to how critical these assets are to powering wireless networks; annual escalators provide a minimal level of stable revenue growth, and towers have significant operating leverage. As data use continues to grow and networks get more stretched, locating equipment on more towers and upgrading equipment are primary solutions for carriers.  About 45% of SBAs towers, and more than 75% of its revenue, are in the U.S., where mobile data use has been growing 30%-40% per year. Considering the U.S. is also the most profitable market, the company has been well-served by having such a presence there. However, we expect tower sales growth in the U.S. to stay below the levels achieved toward the end of last decade and the beginning of the 2020s. After multiple major U.S. spectrum auctions in that time period, we now think carriers have deployed most of the spectrum they won. We dont anticipate additional auctions for big spectrum blocks in the near term and dont expect deployment of already-controlled spectrum on additional towers will be a major catalyst. We expect exposure to emerging international markets to be more attractive. SBA has expanded its international exposure in recent years. In addition to South America and Canada, the firm now also has towers in South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Less mature markets leave carriers with a long runway of investment to improve network quality and coverage, and results in even faster growth in consumers data consumptionencouraging for SBAs tower prospects in those markets. However, the firms profits are still dominated by the U.S. business, and its international fortunes continue to be mostly dependent on Brazil.  ","We assign SBA Communications a narrow economic moat due to the efficient scale that underlies the tower industry and switching costs that dissuade tenants from seeking alternative providers once they have installed their equipment on towers. SBAs returns have been trending up over the last decade and have averaged over 11% the last five years, exceeding the 8% cost of capital that we estimate for the firm. Given the critical nature towers play in allowing the public access to mobile data, the lack of near-term substitutes to towers, and the barriers to alternative tower providers, we expect excess returns to continue for the next decade as well, resulting in our narrow moat rating. The efficient scale present for major tower providers is enhanced by the extreme operating leverage associated with individual towers and the limited number of potential customers. Economic returns on towers are typically not good until the tower provider can secure multiple tenants on the tower, and the pool of sizable customers in any area is limited to the number of wireless carriers operating networks. These factors should make it unlikely that new competitors could profitably build a large portfolio of towers in areas that already have quality wireless network coverage.Costs to the tower provider are mostly fixed per tower, meaning costs to operate a tower are virtually the same whether a tower has one tenant or several tenants. According to SBA, initial tenants on a typical U.S. tower pay about $30,000 per year in rent and yield a 50% gross margin for the company. Industry peer American Tower has disclosed that an average U.S. tower costs about $275,000 to build. Using that construction cost assumption, which we think is reasonable given that both American Tower and SBA have footprints mostly in suburban and rural areas, initial returns on SBA towers would be about 5.5%. Assuming no incremental costs for adding a second tenant (SBA states that additional tenants pay similar rents as the anchor tenant and result in virtually no additional monthly expenses), yields on the tower would get into the midteens. SBA averaged only 1.8 tenants per tower at the end of 2020, and industry peer Crown Castle has stated that it has historically taken about 10 years to add a tenant per tower. Consequently, even before considering other hurdles an upstart competitor would have to overcome to compete on SBAs turf, it would have to contemplate sinking tremendous amounts of capital into building towers, locking itself into $1,000 per month land lease payments over a term of five to 10 years, and, given a likely need to offer lower average prices to carriers to entice them to switch, would need to average close to two tenants per tower before generating excess returns on its capital, something that might not realistically be likely to happen for about a decade.We think a new competitor undertaking such an endeavor unlikely considering the limited number of potential tenants and switching costs that make taking those tenants away from rivals difficult. Most markets have only three or four major carriers that own wireless networks, and they make up almost all of the spending on towers. In the U.S., the Big Three wireless service providers make up about 90% of the geographic segments revenue. The firms top three international customers make up almost 60% of international revenue, which is predominantly in Brazil.Switching costs make tenants unlikely to vacate towers if they want to maintain a presence in the area. Carriers own and are responsible for the equipment they deploy at and on the towers, and they are responsible for removing it if their leases expire. Crown Castle has stated that it costs carriers about $40,000 to remove equipment from a tower in the U.S. With SBAs U.S. tenants paying $30,000 per year in rent, it means they would have to recoup over a year's worth of rent payments to break even. A rival would need to undercut SBAs prices by that much more to make up for the loss carriers would be facing in deciding to switch, further impeding a competitors prospects of generating excess returns. Yet direct costs are not the only switching costs carriers face. Carriers most valuable assets are their networks, and any disruption to the network, whether temporarily during a tower switch or more permanently as a result of a new setup and location, risks customer dissatisfaction with their service. Given the negligible switching costs to carriers customers, we dont think network risk is one carriers would take lightly or put in jeopardy for minimal cost savings, adding even more to the amount a rival would likely need undercut prices to coax carriers into making the gamble. History suggests that carriers hesitate to leave towers that they are on, as non-consolidation-related churn for SBA has consistently been under one percent for the last several years.While we think barriers to competition for the existing public tower companies are overwhelming in the near term, there are a couple of factors that reduce our visibility over a 20-year span, keeping us from labeling SBAs moat as wide. First, the tower companies typically lease significantly more land than they own. Though we think SBA is favorably positioned among the tower companies, with 70% of its land under its control for at least the next twenty years, it still will need to renegotiate leases as they expire and negotiate leases for new sites. We have less confidence that it will retain its leverage over land owners or advantages versus other potential land tenants. We think competitors are unlikely to build competing towers in tower vicinities; their better competitive move, in our view, would be to secure available land where towers already exist. While incumbents may be best positioned to hold on to their land, they may be forced to do it on less favorable terms, which could affect returns.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for SBA is Medium. We are confident towers will be integral to telecommunications throughout our forecast, but SBA's stock value is dependent on U.S. carriers needing to continue investing heavily in macro tower sites. The firm also keeps a highly leveraged balance sheet.If there is ever an alternative to macro large towers or the ability for carriers to rely on them less than they have historically, SBA's growth will suffer. We think small cellsan industry in which SBA does not participateare unlikely to cannibalize tower need. Towers are much more cost-efficient, especially in the ex-urban areas where SBA most commonly resides. However, greater use of small cells by carriers could reduce tower demand at the margins, and other technological advances could allow for lower tower density needs for carriers. More likely, maturing 5G networks and less wireless spectrum for carriers to deploy should make high sales growth less reliable. We dont think SBA has high ESG risk. Two potential ESG issues that SBAs business lends itself to are the risk of natural disasters, which seem to have become worse with climate change, and the high level of business the firm does in more developing countries where the rule of law is not as strong. Isolated incidents of tower sites going down in natural disasters are commonplace and not something that affect our view of the business. It would take many sites in a wide area getting destroyed for it to affect our valuation.SBAs aggressive use of financial leverage is also a risk. The firms strategy to take on debt to fund share repurchases results in it targeting a net debt/EBITDA ratio of greater than 7 times, and although steady cash flow should allow it to cover its obligations without concern, its more susceptible than peers to major disruptions.","We assign SBA Communications a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. Our rating is driven primarily by SBAs philosophy of shareholder distributions but also takes into account the shape of its balance sheet and the likelihood that it adds value through investments.We are generally uneasy with the way SBA manages its balance sheet and aggressively repurchases stock, but we acknowledge it has been a very successful strategy for SBA for many years and has created significant shareholder value to this point. SBA chooses to keep a very highly leveraged balance sheet and add debt for the purpose of repurchasing shares, with little consideration of share price. Since 2015, SBA has shrunk its share count by over 10% while spending $4 billion on share repurchases. During that time the firm has also added about $3 billion in debt, keeping its net debt/EBITDA ratio above 7. In our view, the stock has been overvalued for much of this period, and given the philosophy, we think it is likely to be dilutive over time. Wed prefer SBA to be more discriminating in buying back shares and to return a little bit less capital to shareholders until it brings its leverage ratio down. Nonetheless, we cant argue with historical results. The stock has generally trended up and the balance sheet leverage has not been problematic, so managements strategy has succeeded so far.Despite the high debt leverage and ostensibly weak balance sheet, we think it is unlikely SBA will have difficulty managing it. SBAs tower customers are financially stable, locked into long-term contracts, and are extremely unlikely to ever reduce their use of SBAs towers, so SBA has a very reliable cash flow stream that should allow it to meet all obligations. SBAs adjusted EBITDA has consistently covered interest expense by more than 3 times throughout the past decade, and the firm has encountered no issues rolling over its debt. . At the end of 2022, about $3.0 billion, or almost 25% of the total is set to mature within the next three years, and another $2.6 billion matures in 2026. We project free cash flow to exceed $1 billion annually during that period. We think SBAs investment strategy is appropriate and is unlikely to be as big a factor in shareholder returns as distributions are. Reinvestment needs for the core U.S. tower business are low, and SBA has chosen to stay geographically concentrated, with about three quarters of its sales in the U.S. and nearly all its business in the U.S. and Brazil. While taking less international risk limits the revenue upside relative to competitor American Tower, in our view, it also leads to predictable, low-risk performance that doesnt require significant investment. We project capital spending to remain in the midsingle digits as a percentage of sales over our five-year forecast, similar to the capital intensity the firm has averaged over the past five years, when it averaged 5%-6% same-tower revenue growth.","SBA Communications owns and operates almost 40,000 cell towers throughout North America, South America, and Africa. It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, who install equipment on the towers to support their wireless networks. The company has a very concentrated customer base, with most revenue in each market being generated by just the top few mobile carriers. The company owns more than 17,000 towers in the U.S., which accounted for about three fourths of the companys total revenue in 2022. Internationally, SBAs greatest presence is in Brazil, where it operates roughly 10,000 towers. SBA operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT.","SBA is the most financially leveraged of the three public U.S. tower companies and has the lowest interest coverage ratio of the three by a wide margin. It closed 2022 with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 7.2 and an interest coverage ratio (adjusted EBITDA/interest expense) of 5.0. However, SBA has operated with a similar structure for the entire decade, and we don't have imminent concerns about SBAs ability to operate at these levels in the current environment. SBA doesnt have any major debt maturities until 2025, when about 17% of its total debt comes due, and because of the stability of its business even in recessions and through a pandemic-related lockdown, we dont expect it to be in danger of breaching debt covenants or being unable to access credit markets.High leverage is a part of SBAs strategy rather than a result of cash flow difficulties. SBA has grown free cash flow every year since 2011, and even after including several hundred million dollars in tower acquisitions each year, it has averaged over $300 million in free cash annually over the past five years. SBA uses the financial leverage to repurchase sharesan average of almost $600 million worth annually since 2015. We project a similar level of buybacks in each of the next five years. The firm also began paying a dividend in 2019, which, as a REIT, it will be required to maintain.Even with the high leverage and buybacks, we believe SBA has sufficient financial flexibility to continue its international expansion. We project, on average, the firm will acquire 800-1,000 new towers annually, primarily in international markets, while still averaging about $1 billion of free cash flow annually after including the acquisition spending. The cash flow should allow SBA to take on only minimal amounts of incremental debt throughout our forecast while continuing with high levels of share repurchases and gradually reducing its leverage ratio.

24/11/2023,"MercadoLibre Firing on All Cylinders as Loyalty Program, Fintech Services Gain Momentum",MercadoLibre Inc,MELI,3,20/11/2023,Sean Dunlop,1525.0,USD,23/11/2023,1330.0,Very High,Wide,Exemplary,B,20/11/2023,"We expect limited valuation impact from the election of libertarian president Javier Milei in Argentina for wide-moat MercadoLibre, with dollarization striking us as unlikely and with currency weakness already impacting our $1,330 fair value estimate through foreign exchange losses and a higher risk premium for the firm's Argentine operations. While Argentine markets are closed Nov. 20, U.S.-listed ETF ARGT is up 11%-12% on the news as traders digest results. MercadoLibre shares are up by a smaller amount (1%-2%) but have rallied by more than 20% in the election run-up over the past three months and look slightly overvalued. Milei is a political outsider, running a campaign built around Argentine distaste with lofty inflation (north of 140% annually) and deteriorating international cachet as the country has lost access to international capital markets amid persistent budget deficits and bond defaults. His proposals are sweeping, including Argentine dollarization, privatization of state-run firms, and deep cuts to government entitlement spending to address the country's fiscal woes. We expect limited success due to Argentina's lacking foreign exchange reservesjust north of $22 billion, per Bloomberg, plus a $19 billion Chinese line of creditwith the news outlet estimating about $40 billion required to buy all the pesos currently in circulation. In tandem with the country's need to pay back roughly $40 billion in IMF debt, we'd be surprised if it were able to pursue both priorities. From a practical perspective, Argentine peso weakness is incorporated into our model through foreign exchange losses and a 35% repatriation tax that Argentine companies pay for dividends converted at the informal ""blue chip swap"" rate. While we expect another deep peso devaluation, the combination of proportionately more costs than revenue sitting in Argentina for MercadoLibre and the benefit of a lower country risk premia would offset the translation loss on revenue, by our estimates.","Surging digital payment adoption and increasing acceptance of online shopping should underpin a durable secular growth narrative for MercadoLibre. The scaling of a first-party sales business allows MercadoLibre to compete more effectively during key holiday seasons, with strategic discounts of anchor products. Consumer and small-business lending addresses a key pain point in traditional financial-service offerings while tying merchants and customers more closely to the MercadoLibre platform.","Government-funded solutions outside of conventional ACH transfers and debit payments, particularly in Brazil (Pix), could apply downward pressure to take rates in the fintech business. A devaluation of the Argentine peso would severely curtail that region's contribution to sales growth (though operating income and net income remain largely hedged). Linguistic, trade, and cultural idiosyncrasies complicate cross-border selling in the region, resulting in the maintenance of separate marketplace properties in each country.",06/11/2023,"MercadoLibre has positioned itself as a one-stop e-commerce solution for Latin American buyers and sellers. It has developed a comprehensive ecosystem of mutually reinforcing services, with its core marketplace supported by a payments and lending arm (Mercado Pago and Mercado Credito), a best-in-breed shipping solution (Mercado Envios), and an increasingly robust advertising platform (Mercado Ads). With effectively all the firm's platform gross merchandise volume funneled through proprietary payment rails and more than 94% of items sold shipped managed through Envios, the marketplace operator has effectively addressed two of the biggest pain points in e-commerce. MercadoLibre's strategy lines up closely with that of the largest global e-commerce players: attracting users to the platform with shipping subsidies and membership rewards, offering sellers a simple and convenient user interface to ease listing friction, and reducing incentives to multihome for all platform participants as fulfillment speeds grow quicker and per-unit shipping costs fall further. We expect platform monetization to increase gradually and anticipate that swelling customer expectations around quick shipping times, increasing fulfillment penetration, and expanding small merchant credit tied to platform sales should render MercadoLibre's services increasingly sticky. We appreciate the company's gradual move toward faster-moving consumer goods, grocery partnerships, and first-party sales, particularly as a cohort of customers maintain COVID-19-driven purchasing habits outside the traditional e-commerce decision set. While these products see lower average selling prices, they lend themselves to repeat purchase behavior, better positioning MercadoLibre to compete for customers' first online product searchdriving better conversion rates and improved advertising monetization. We view the firm's main challenges moving forward as consistent with those of the past; increasing fulfillment penetration, generating operating leverage in shipping and payments solutions, and continuing to improve the user experience on the platform, driving barriers to success higher for competitors.","Global e-commerce is intensely competitive, marked by low barriers to entry, readily available price comparisons for standardized products, and constant jockeying for differentiation based on ease of search, fulfillment speed, breadth of product selection, and auxiliary services. In our view, operators that can carve out moats generally develop a self-reinforcing network of buyers and sellers on their platforms, deriving a competitive advantage from access to unique inventory thats difficult to multihome, building a local network around a particular niche or customer group, or by offering a comprehensive value proposition that includes some combination of payment and lending solutions, fulfillment, first-party inventory, and customer-facing services. Further, while e-commerce markets naturally lend themselves to multihoming, operators may develop switching costs by warehousing and shipping third-party products, by offering a better return on advertising spending than competitors, and by providing merchants and buyers with credit services, particularly in emerging markets with lower financial-services penetration. In our view, MercadoLibre has built a wide economic moat around its Latin American e-commerce ecosystem (implying excess returns over 20 years), benefiting from a quickly growing network of buyers and sellers on its platform, privileged access to consumer transaction data, and switching costs as sellers and buyers increasingly depend on the firms broadening suite of services (including the core marketplace, shipping solutions, classified ads, mobile payments, and digital advertisements). Our average goodwill-adjusted return on invested capital forecast of 29% through 2032 embodies this view, handily outpacing our weighted average cost of capital estimate of 13% for the firm.We view a network effect as MercadoLibres principal moat source, and the key advantage underpinning its commerce segment (representing roughly 68% of 2022 consolidated revenue). In our view, the platform grows stronger as new users are onboarded to both sides of the marketplace, with sellers benefiting from quicker inventory turnover and access to a larger pool of potential customers, while buyers benefit from better search engine optimization, breadth of selection, and lower shipping costs. Consequently, more buyers on the platform encourages further seller participation, while a deeper pool of sellers adds stock-keeping units, lowers search costs for customers, and entices more buyers to join the platform in a positive feedback loop.The firms marketplace and payment platforms connected some 148 million active buyers and more than a million active sellers across 18 national markets in 2022, implying that more than 20% of Latin Americans and just shy of 30% of Latin American internet users transacted through the marketplace or Mercado Pago properties during the year (per our calculations and World Bank data). Importantly, MercadoLibre has been able to effectively monetize its network, seeing commerce revenue grow at a 54% CAGR between 2018 and 2022 (against a 29% gross merchandise volume CAGR during that period), with increased advertising penetration, strategic price increases, and fulfillment services offering material upside for incremental monetization through our explicit forecast (which sees third-party take rates normalize around 19%-20% in 2032, up from 14.2% in 2022). The company stands to benefit from many important secular trends: a gradual mix shift toward e-commerce, with consumers increasingly appreciating the convenience of 24/7 website availability and quick home shipping, a renewed emphasis on digital payments in Latin America, a surge in participation in the formal banking system, and ongoing increases in internet penetration in the region, offering platform access to a heretofore untapped clientele. While brick-and-mortar retail figures to retain value for servicing select categories and purchase occasions, MercadoLibres investments in fast-moving consumer goods and grocery store partnerships betray an interest in becoming customers one-stop shop for online ordering, imitating successes at wide-moat Amazon, wide-moat Walmart, and wide-moat Alibaba. Ultimately, we believe that the firms attention to quickly adapting the best of global peers innovations, its robust suite of auxiliary seller services, and modular improvements to the customer experience via loyalty, search engine optimization, media streaming, peer-to-peer payments, and financial-technology solutions leave few incentives for participants to abandon the platform, perpetuating its network effect.Next, we view the treasure trove of data from marketplace transactions, fulfillment services, and payments as the driving factor underpinning MercadoLibres intangible asset moat source, permitting better sales forecasting, reducing purchase friction, and continually improving average delivery times. While there are certainly larger global e-commerce companies and strong regional brick-and-mortar retailers, MercadoLibre maintains a compelling database of Latin American e-commerce transactions that captures both idiosyncratic behavior by local consumers and differences between online and in-store shopping behaviors, particularly when considered in tandem with the firms burgeoning brick-and-mortar point-of-sale offering (with nearly three fourths of processed payments occurring off-platform). By our estimates, the firm maintained north of 25% share of the quickly growing Latin American e-commerce market, outpacing its closest local competitors (Lojas Americanas and Magazine Luiza) by a factor of 4-5 times across the regional block (according to our estimates, company filings, and Euromonitor data), allowing for superior search engine optimization, conversion rates, and advertising efficacy. The firms intangible assets underpin a quickly improving marketplace value proposition, evidenced by strong growth in active users, 750 basis points of marketplace take-rate expansion, and ongoing market share gains between 2018 and 2022.On the fulfillment side, MercadoLibre managed shipping for more than 1 billion items (more than 94% of items sold on its marketplace) in 2022, with proprietary technologies stitching together a complex network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, cross-docking facilities, third-party service providers, and national post outfits. As the firm has progressed along the learning curve, weve seen average delivery times fall to just 1.5 days, against three to four days for the Brazilian postal service, with sub-48-hour deliveries clocking in just shy of 80% by the end of 2022 (with same- and next-day delivery consistently in the 50%-55% range). We believe that inefficiencies with the public postal service render private investments in proprietary fulfillment solutions compelling, with heavy union representation among national post employees resulting in lethargic investments in labor-saving automation, limited scalability, and slower servicepermitting private players to generate value by alleviating one of two critical pain points (shipping and payments) in e-commerce and heightening barriers to entry for potential competitors. Owned logistics also permits redundancies, and routing around isolated worker strikes or inventory bottlenecks to avoid service outages. With the largest e-commerce players leaning heavily on proprietary fulfillment apparatuses, there has been little incentive for the development of a robust network of third-party providers, heightening barriers to entry for new players in the market, with entrants forced to palate slower shipping speeds through national postal services or otherwise absorb high up-front investments in warehouses, vehicles, and equipment.Turning to payments, $122 billion in processed payment volume during 2022, including 100% of marketplace gross merchandise volume, reduces friction at checkout (keeping consumers on platform), limits chargebacks and allowances for bad debt, and may allow the firm to better underwrite short-term credit for micro, small, and medium businesses, or MSMBs, and consumers than traditional regional banks, particularly when tied to platform GMV or used in tandem with data from incumbent banks (pending open banking implementation in Latin America). Notably, while weve assigned brand intangible assets to some e-commerce retailers in the past, our analysis for MercadoLibre failed to yield any evidence of pricing premiums, though we suspect that, similar to Amazon, the platform has increasingly earned top mind-share for product search, which could yield benefits through better advertising conversion rates and higher GMV growth. Organic search traffic was 61% at the end of 2022, slightly behind scaled e-commerce marketplaces in the U.S. (narrow-moat eBay around 80%, Amazon's 83%, per SimilarWeb data). Considering our final moat source, we believe MercadoLibre has been able to tackle the most elusive problem for marketplace operators: creating switching costs around their platforms and avoiding the pernicious problem of multihoming. While churn for MSMBs is naturally high (limiting customer lifetime value and implicit duration of relationships), we view switching costs as most pronounced in this long-tail segment, with turnkey website solutions, inventory management, demand forecasting, on-platform advertising, and customer relationship management tools representing particularly painful systems to rip out and replace. This is particularly true for operators that generate material sales on the platform; a 2022 Center for Argentine Commerce study suggested that retailers that maintain a presence on online marketplaces generate 45% of consolidated sales on that platform, a huge sales base that we believe they'd be reluctant to surrender.For larger merchants, we expect MercadoLibre to take a different tack, subsidizing shipping fulfillment services and warehousing over the near to medium term to ensure standardization, quality, and faster inventory turnover. As fulfillment penetration increases (from 43% at the end of 2022) to levels seen in more mature geographies (nearly 70% in Mexico), and as the lions share of orders are managed, through fulfillment or cross-docking, we believe that the firm will be able to gradually raise prices to the extent that sellers benefit from faster inventory turns even as their (sellers') operating margins contract. Ultimately, for standardized products that turn over more quickly, warehousing makes a lot of economic sense, and increases switching costs for firms in the MercadoLibre ecosystem, with sellers reluctant to return to slower public shipping alternatives, particularly as customer demand grows increasingly sensitive to shipping speed and pricing. Lastly, on the seller side of the equation, MSMB credit figures to keep long-tail sellers on platform, with the firm tying credit availability closely to seller GMV, and reducing credit losses by withdrawing interest and principal payments directly from seller revenue. With Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, which together represented 95% of 2022 revenue, performing poorly on credit availability for small and midsize businesses (scoring 103rd, 132nd, and 85th out off 141, per the World Economic Forums 2019 competitiveness report), we view this as a competitive differentiator, more closely tying merchants to the platform. While switching costs for consumers are admittedly weaker, a suite of financial products, including after pay services and revolving credit (with proprietary scoring based on platform payment behavior), mobile wallets (with QR code payments with select retail partners, bill payment functionality, and mobile phone top-ups), and asset management generating inertia. While customer churn is difficult to isolate, an increasingly compelling value proposition, with free shipping breakpoints lowered to BRL 79 (approximately $15), average delivery times of 1.5 days, partnerships with music and video streaming providers, an improving search functionality, and maintained rollout of auxiliary products and updates reduces incentives to multi-home, even for buyers.Finally, considering the duration of the economic moat, we believe that 20 years for excess returns is appropriate, with each passing year increasing the barriers to success and entry costs for competitors built in the MercadoLibre image. A viable competitor would have to offer similar product breadth, competitive adjacent services (shipping, platform advertisements, payments, turnkey web solutions, advertising, classifieds), and better pricing to capture any meaningful market share, as we see it, likely enduring many years of painful losses.","As we evaluate MercadoLibre's quickly evolving product suite, end markets, and sensitivity to macroeconomic health, we believe the firm warrants a Very High Uncertainty Rating. This view is corroborated by quantitative uncertainty tools and reflects heavy indexation to revenue streams with inherently cyclical demand (like consumer credit) and to emerging-market economies whose fiscal health remains acutely sensitive to global interest rates and capital flows.On the commerce side, MercadoLibre remains sensitive to consumer health across a product suite that skews toward apparel, home decor, and other discretionary products. High category growth and a mix shift from physical stores has driven elevated incidence of online couponing, seller rebates, and shipping incentives, all of which affect profitability. While the firm remains well positioned to win in the space, success is far from a foregone conclusion, given the relatively early stage of market development and presence of large, well-capitalized competitors.Further, Latin America banks have tended to generate much higher returns on equity than counterparts in the United States and Europe, attributable in part to concentration, high fees for basic services, and a large population of unbanked citizens (impeding effective credit scoring and leading to higher discount rates). These returns have attracted substantial competitive pressure, with a slew of financial technology companies jockeying for market share in lending, payment processing, insurance underwriting, and brokerage services.Finally, we identify human capital management as the most material environmental, social, and governance risk facing the firm, with recruitment of talented developers (particularly considering Latin American educational infrastructure and lower regional per capita income) adding a degree of uncertainty, potentially affecting the firm's ability to consistently provide a superior user experience across its expanding product suite.","We assign MercadoLibre an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, as we consider the firm's balance sheet heath, investment opportunities, and shareholder distribution policy. In our view, MercadoLibre scores well on all three pillars of our framework.Considering the firm's financial health, low revenue cyclicality in the core marketplace and payments businesses, medium operating leverage, and a moderate debt burden (2.4 times gross debt/adjusted EBITDA through 2027) underpin our assessment. While the firm is subject to an implicit credit rating ceiling, attributable to deriving roughly 75%-80% of revenue from non-investment-grade Brazil and Argentina, it doesn't appear beholden to commensurately higher issuance costs, evidenced by the its sub-3.2% coupon rates on its 2026 and 2031 convertible notes. While we anticipate cumulative capital expenditures of $2.0 billion through 2025, we believe that $5.5 billion in unrestricted cash, equivalents, and investments at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and securitization in the credit business should be more than enough to fund expected lending and fixed investment needs.On the investment side, we've been impressed by management's hefty investments in fulfillment infrastructure, permitting the firm to compete more effectively in business-to-consumer channels. MercadoLibre slashed its dividend in 2018 as it built out its Envios platform, broadened its financial-services ecosystem, and retooled the platform experiencegenerating three successive years of net lossesbut in our view, it succeeded where other customer-to-customer marketplaces have failed: in proactively pivoting toward B2C sales, consolidating market share, and building a defensible, analog moat around its ecosystem. In the long run, we're encouraged by the firm's attention to allow incremental sales to drop to the bottom line only strategically, conditioning investors to value growth while deferring profitability, a strategy that has materially benefited wide-moat Amazon in the U.S. As a result, we expect MercadoLibre to remove costs only with careful deliberation and would welcome further investment at our current estimates of return on new invested capital, with persistently strong ROICs suggesting that incremental investments should continue to prove moat accretive. We're particularly impressed by management's willingness to funnel capital toward operations that generate the highest return on incremental investment, while avoiding value-dilutive investments that might generate outsize growth at the expense of business health or profitability. A perfect example of this would be the firm's decision to slow new loan issuance in the third quarter of 2022 as Brazilian interest rates began to climb and as borrower creditworthiness declined in the older portion of the credit book. Similarly, management prudently slowed investment in its budding first-party sales business (predominantly consumer electronics) until the firm was able to generate more competitive contribution margins as it worked through lingering issues in the segment.Further, we appreciate management's agility in responding to quickly evolving competition, strategically accelerating investments in response to market demands. Meli+, the firm's tiered rewards offering, is a marquee example of this, with MercadoLibre pulling forward investments in the program as quarantined consumers flooded online in 2020 and 2021. That program lays the groundwork for an Amazon Prime-esque paid membership, which would help offset the firm's shipping cost and reduce pressure to monetize sellers as it seeks to increase fulfillment penetration and service quality. Other examples abound, including a pivot toward building out first-party inventory and grocery partnerships last year, and a quick ramp of fulfillment capacity in Andean markets as competitive dynamics auspiciously shifted. Moving forward, we expect the firm's new advertising platform, additional drop-off hubs closer to sellers (accelerating flex, or one-day fulfillment offerings), added redundancies among third-party providers in the Envios network, and brand-building behind the Mercado Pago product suite to represent the bulk of investment outlay.On the distribution front, we don't expect MercadoLibre to layer capital returns into the model until 2026 at the earliest, which we view as appropriate in light of the available investment opportunity frontier and heady returns on incremental investments. Given an extremely scalable third-party marketplace and payment processing model, we anticipate low-double-digit free cash flow generation (as a percentage of sales) in the long term, suggesting attractive long-term capital returns potential for shareholders. ","MercadoLibre runs the largest e-commerce marketplace in Latin America, connecting a network of more than 148 million active users and 1 million active sellers as of the end of 2022 across an 18-country footprint. The company also operates a host of complementary businesses, with shipping solutions (Mercado Envios), a payment and financing operation (Mercado Pago and Mercado Credito), advertisements (Mercado Clics), classifieds, and a turnkey e-commerce solution (Mercado Shops) rounding out its arsenal. MercadoLibre generates revenue from final value fees, advertising royalties, payment processing, insertion fees, subscription fees, and interest income from consumer and small-business lending.","We assess MercadoLibres financial strength as strong. With $5.5 billion in unrestricted cash, equivalents, and investments on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and access to a $400 million credit facility, the firm appears adequately capitalized to meet its near-term financial obligations and to cover planned capital expenditures.MercadoLibre maintains a heavy tilt toward equity funding, which we anticipate holding relatively steady even as the firm scales its nascent credit business. Despite an implicit issuer rating ceiling (driven by non-investment-grade sovereign ratings for Brazil and Argentina, where roughly 75%-80% of consolidated revenue is generated), were encouraged by the markets confidence in the firm, with its 2026 and 2031 convertible notes carrying coupons of just 2.375% and 3.125%, respectively.While planned capital expenditures (we anticipate $2.0 billion in aggregate through 2025) represent a significant outlay, we view current cash and equivalent balances, in tandem with anticipated securitized debt issuance, as more than sufficient to fund the firm's growth initiatives. While we anticipate the firm remaining cautious about dropping operating leverage to the bottom line too quickly, we expect that a substantial portion of sales and marketing expenditures remains discretionary and could be repurposed in the presence of capital constraints.As investment wanes and the firm further monetizes its highly scalable marketplace and fintech platforms, we expect free cash flow to the firm generation to markedly quicken, reaching nearly 12% of sales by 2032 and averaging 10% annually in the back half of our explicit forecast. Average gross debt/adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times over the next five years also appears manageable, with MercadoLibre seeing no material principal maturities until 2026.",MELI,Consumer Cyclical,83547594752.0,NMS,377783.0,USD,1525.0,True,0,1302.0622414981647,1630.633575062689,1
24/11/2023,Narrow-Moat Monster Poised to Expand Volume with Innovation Pipeline and Coca-Cola Alliance,Monster Beverage Corp,MNST,2,03/11/2023,Dan Su,55.22,USD,23/11/2023,48.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,03/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Monster Beverage posted accelerating volume and better-than-expected profit growth in the third quarter, reinforcing our confidence in its long-term prospects underpinned by brand intangibles and the strategic partnership with wide-moat Coca-Cola. Sales grew 14% (on an 11% volume expansion, accelerating from 8% in the first half) and EPS rose 43%, outpacing our estimates for 13% and 25% increases, respectively. We plan to tick up our 2023 forecasts, but our 10-year projections for high-single-digit annual sales growth and operating margin averaging 32% remain in place. As such, our $48 fair value estimate will likely rise by a low-single-digit percentage. We view the shares as fairly valued. Net sales for the Monster Energy drinks segment (90% of sales) grew 15% on a constant-currency basis, with low-teens volume expansion showcasing the firms ability to retain and expand its consumer base through product innovation (zero-sugar recipes, new fruit flavors, and slim packaging), effective digital marketing that resonates with consumers, and expanding distribution in Europe and Asia, including China, where Monster currently holds a low-single-digit volume share. We see volume upside from the Bang acquisition, which closed in July and should expand Monsters exposure to the lifestyle segment of the energy drink market as well as help fend off competition from new entrants including Celsius and C4. However, we expect the volume contribution to be small in the coming quarters as distribution migrates to the Coke system. We think management is prudent to limit price hikes to 2%-3%, consistent with historical levels, which should help preserve its value proposition amid consumer belt-tightening. Operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 27.5%, thanks to easing freight and aluminum cost inflation and efficiency initiatives, and we think the firm remains on track to bring margins back to the low 30s over the next three years.","Strong energy drink demand, coupled with Monsters strong innovation pipeline, bodes well for high-single-digit top-line growth in the coming years.  Monster has broadened its appeal to health-conscious consumers with better-for-you drinks, including zero sugar, zero calorie offerings and beverages containing only natural ingredients.  Monster stands to gain volume share as the maker of rival brand Bang (with high-single-digit volume share in the U.S.) filed for bankruptcy in 2022. ","Regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions in the U.S. and Europe will likely persist and erode Monsters brand intangibles and retail demand.  PepsiCo has stepped up investments in its own energy drink portfolio, posing threats to Monsters dominance in North America.  The firm faces an uphill battle to advance its low-single-digit volume share in Asia-Pacific (35% of global energy drink demand) given stiff competition from Red Bulls sister company T.C. Pharmaceutical and other well-established local brands. ",25/05/2023,"Although not the pioneer in energy drinks, Monster has earned its perch in this attractive category through innovations that resonate with consumers and effective marketing that keeps its core brand top of mind. The long-term alliance with wide-moat Coca-Cola, effective since 2015, further advances Monsters competitive standing, affording the firm impressive distribution breath and product availability that is hard to match by rivals. As such, we award a narrow economic moat rating for Monster.  We see Monster as remaining well positioned to capitalize on favorable energy drink demand in the coming years, thanks to a sharpened focus on user activation and retention by expanding consumption occasions and adding better-for-you options, including zero sugar versions of its classic recipes and plant-based drinks. In addition, we expect Monsters efforts to reach more untapped consumers in vast emerging markets across Latin America and Eastern Europe to receive stronger support from the Coke system, now that Coca-Cola has scrapped its own energy offerings following a lackluster response. Monster has a two-pronged strategy in place, maintaining a premium positioning for the core Monster trademark in the modern retail and convenience channels, while rolling out Predator and Fury brands at more affordable price points to tap consumers not as well-heeled as the traditional Monster demographic. We believe the Coke systems close ties with the traditional trade will be particularly helpful to this affordability endeavor.  Despite our sanguine view, Monsters growth outlook is not without risks. Regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions on caffeine content and marketing constraints remain a threat to Monsters brand image and volume demand in North America and Western Europe. Competition ferocity is on the rise as well, as beverage giant wide-moat PepsiCo brings strong tier-two energy brands onto its own distribution network, while various emerging brands target energy drinkers that look for new fares. That said, we believe Monster is poised to continue thriving thanks to an advantaged competitive position and managements strong execution.  ","We believe Monster Beverage has carved out a narrow economic moat, thanks to strong brand affinity in the energy drink category and extensive distribution reach through a long-term partnership with the Coca-Cola system globally. The brand intangible-driven moat has helped the firm deliver returns on invested capital (including goodwill) that exceeded our estimate of its 7.5% weighted average cost of capital over the past 10 years, and we project excess investment returns to continue over the next decade. That said, Monsters narrow focus on energy drinks (which represent a low-single-digit percentage of overall soft drink volume), regulatory headwinds, and uncertainties surrounding the ultimate renewal of the Coke distribution agreement in 12 years, combine to constrain our confidence in the firms ability to deliver excess returns for more than 20 years. We therefore cap our rating at a narrow moat. Monsters intangible asset-driven moat is premised on the brand equity associated with its namesake Monster trademark. Although launched 15 years behind energy drink pioneer Red Bull, the Monster brand has amassed leading volume share globally (18% versus 14% for Austria-based Red Bull GmbH, according to Euromonitor). And in its core North America market, where Monster generates two thirds of its revenue, the brand holds a whopping 46% volume share, far outpacing Red Bull at just 25%. We attribute this to Monsters constant stream of innovation that resonates with consumers and a series of high-profile sports sponsorships, including Nascar and MotoGP World Championship, that serve to keep its brand top of mind with consumers.We see structural factors in the $72 billion global energy drink category that are conducive to Monsters brand equity. Favorable volume trends (averaging 6% in the U.S. over the past decade, versus 2% in the overall soft drink sphere) fueled by demand from busy consumers looking for a quick and convenient energy boost have enabled top brands like Monster to increase sales and brand awareness with more productive spending in advertising and marketing. Based on our calculation, each incremental dollar that Monster spent on advertising and marketing drove $13.10 in increased revenue on average over the past five years, ahead of its larger nonalcoholic beverage peers Coca-Cola ($12.00), PepsiCo ($11.40), and Keurig Dr Pepper ($10.20). Moreover, brand differentiation is largely based on perceived functional benefits (such as mental alertness and improved energy level) and to a lesser extent flavor profiles, which underpin consumer loyalty and repeat purchase frequency, thus private-label penetration is low in energy drinks, at low single digits versus the midteens or low-20s common in the domestic consumer goods sphere. As a result, Monster has been able to grow volumes at midteens rates annually over the past five years while keeping prices flat. Even though the firm does not publish retail-level product pricing information to facilitate an analysis of pricing trends, wed point to Monsters high gross margins (averaging 57% over the past five years, comparable with Coca-Cola at 60.1% and PepsiCo at 54.2%), as a strong indication of consumers willingness to pay a premium. We also view Monsters success over the years in adding new product lines and pricing ladders under the Monster banner as evidence of its brand prowess in engaging and maintaining its loyal customer base. Ten product lines have been added to the Monster franchise over the past 20 years, including Monster Super Fuel (containing magnesium and electrolytes for workout enthusiasts), bubbly Juice Monster with various fruit flavors, non-carbonated tea-flavored Monster Rehab, and coffee-infused dairy-based Java Monster. We believe these line extensions have expanded consumption occasions and created more buzz for the existing consumer community while broadening the palate appeal to convert new customers to the trademark in the U.S. and internationally. In addition to the Monster trademark, we see the firms distribution agreement with Coke as the second pillar to our economic moat rating. Effective since 2015, the initial 20-year partnership has essentially made Monster the exclusive energy play in the Coke system, giving Monster invaluable access to Cokes extensive distribution footprint in the U.S. and internationally, while enabling Coke to benefit from Monsters strong volume growth in terms of distribution density to help offset stagnating trends in Cokes core soda business. The tie-up has accelerated Monsters share gains, enabling the firm to further distance itself from Red Bull in North America and to narrow the gap materially in Western Europe. According to Euromonitor, Monsters global volume share received an immediate lift following the agreement, expanding to 17% in 2016 (compared with 13% in 2014), and continued to tick up steadily in the following years to reach 18% by 2022. In comparison, Red Bull GmbHs volume share has stagnated at around 14% over the past decade, which we attribute to conservative product and marketing strategies from the family-owned business. Although Coke launched energy drinks under its own Coke trademark in 2020 in an attempt to go it alone, the product line was discontinued within 18 months due to weak performance. We believe Cokes short-lived endeavor has reaffirmed the strength of the Monster franchise, and we expect the Coke system to reinforce its commitment to the leading energy drink brand. Aided by the Coke system, the Monster products are now sold in over 140 countries and territories around the world, affording brand recognition and product accessibility that is hard to match by its energy drink peers. Over the next 10 years, we think the Coke relationship should deliver more volume upside, particularly in emerging markets such as Latin America, where energy drink consumption volume remains low (at 8% of global volume, versus a 14% share in the overall soft drink aisle). These growth initiatives, which dovetail well with Cokes strategic priorities of tapping consumption upgrade tailwinds in these regions, should drive another leg of volume growth for Monster, supporting our mid-single-digit volume projection for the firm (ahead of the low-single-digit rate we forecast for the overall nonalcoholic beverages). As energy drinks remain a niche in the broader soft drink space (low-single-digit volume share), we dont think Monster benefits from a cost advantage given its negligible scale relative to beverage behemoths such as wide-moats Coke and PepsiCo. Monster has little bargaining power in sourcing ingredients (sweeteners, vitamins, and flavors) or packaging materials (aluminum, PET, and paper cartons) given the substantial overlap with the purchasing baskets of much larger beverage peers. Also, with packaging and distribution outsourced to third-party copackers, bottlers, and distributors, Monster has little wiggle room in negotiating reduced per unit costs. Moreover, its advertising and marketing budget of approximately $460 million in 2022 (7% of sales) is a fraction of the $4.3 billion at Coke (10%) and $5.2 billion at PepsiCo (6%), putting the firm at a disadvantage in bidding for sports and music event sponsorships or securing a popular time slot in broadcast media campaigns. While we see strong evidence of brand intangibles and extensive distribution via the Coke partnership that underpin a durable competitive position, our confidence in Monsters ability to deliver excess investment returns for over 20 years is constrained by the firms narrow focus on the energy drink category, ongoing regulatory scrutiny, and potential restrictive measures for energy drink makers (such as reduced caffeine content, marketing venue restrictions, or even minimum age requirements for purchase). Furthermore, the Coke distribution agreement is up for renewal in 12 years (2035), which introduces further uncertainties around the continuity of the partnership and the economic terms. As such, we view a narrow economic moat as appropriate for Monster. ","We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating to Monster Beverage. The company is exposed to regulatory scrutiny and administrative restrictions that may erode the brand perception and retail demand. A narrow focus on energy drinks further exposes the firm to material and sudden demand shifts away from this category. Monster also faces competitive threats in the energy drink sphere led by PepsiCo and in the malt beverage category where Monster has weak brand perception and distributor relationships. Outsourced manufacturing and distribution make Monster vulnerable to disruptions in third-party co-packing and distribution capacity that could result in production delays and inflated costs. While distribution risks are likely under control due to its alliance with the Coke system and the latters distribution scale, it will remain a challenge for the firm to secure reliable third-party co-packers in emerging markets where the firm looks to ramp up volume. On sourcing, Monsters recent entry into craft beer brewing may subject it to low availability of rare hops (for premium beers) that affects the brewing schedule and output. In addition, we expect the firm to constantly contend with tight aluminum can supply as more beverage makers adapt to increasing preference for this packaging among environmentally conscious consumers.The highly visible Monster trademark is constantly under the scrutiny of consumers given the ubiquity of mobile phones and social media. Any brand messaging, consumer experience, social, or sustainability practice that is perceived to be inconsistent with the companys positioning could be brought into the limelight. Without a timely and appropriate response, brand damage and a hit to volume demand and pricing power could ensue. That said, we dont expect environmental, social, and governance risks will materially affect Monster operational results and investment returns long term. ","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Monster, based on our view that the company has a strong balance sheet, a fair track record of investments for long-term value creation, and an appropriate shareholder distribution practice with stock buybacks. First, we view Monster as in solid financial health. Its balance sheet is strong, with no long-term debt and $3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 2023. This, coupled with steady free cash flow to equity over the next 10 years (averaging 25% of sales), gives us confidence that the company is positioned well to withstand macro volatilities and to invest for long-term growth. On the investment front, capital outlays for organic growth have been the priority, with the firm spending an average of 8% of sales on marketing and advertising over the past five years, though just 2% on capital expenditure as the firm outsources the bulk of manufacturing and distribution. We expect the firm to maintain investments in advertising at similar levels over the next 10 years, while ticking up spending in capacity to 2.5% of sales due to investments in brewing and warehousing capabilities for the newly acquired malt beverage business. We believe these investments are crucial to maintaining the firms long-term competitive position and supporting revenue growth. Monster only made two sizable acquisitions over the past 10 years, namely the $690 million purchase of major flavor supplier American Fruits & Flavors (AFF) in 2016 and the $330 million deal buying California-based craft brewer CANarchy in 2022. Given that AFF contributes under 1% of operating profits to Monster, we believe the transaction is most likely a strategic one to lock in high-quality fruit ingredients and flavors that help differentiate Monster from peers. Regarding the CANarchy acquisition in 2022, we think the firm is prudently diversifying into the alcoholic beverage category for new avenues of growth and, if successful, should alleviate investor concern about Monsters narrow focus on energy drinks. That said, given Monsters lack of well-known malt beverage brands and stiff competition led by entrenched players, including Constellation, AB InBev, and Boston Beer, Monster will need to invest heavily in marketing and distributor relationship building for several years at least before generating tangible benefits from the acquisition. For now, its too early to assess whether the deal can add to the firms overall investment returns. We believe the swap of Monsters nonenergy assets for Cokes seven-brand energy drink portfolio in 2015 (as part of the long-term partnership agreement) was an important transaction as well, which helped to cement Monsters status as the exclusive energy play in the Coke system and eliminated potential conflicts of interests between the two partners. However, the price tag for the Coke assets was undisclosed, making it impossible for us to quantify investment returns from this deal. On shareholder distributions, Monster has not paid any cash dividends since inception and has no such plans in the foreseeable future. However, the company did return more than $5 billion in cash to shareholders since 2012 via share buybacks. As of March 2023, repurchase plans authorized by the board had a remaining balance of $680 million. We expect the firm to continue with share buybacks in the coming years, though we stick to our view that buybacks create value for shareholders only when executed at market prices below our assessment of intrinsic value, and its not necessary to commit to a fixed target amount. ","Monster Beverage is a leader in the energy drink subsegment of the nonalcoholic beverage market, generating two thirds of revenue in the U.S. and Canada. The well-known Monster trademark includes brands such as Monster Energy, Monster Ultra, Java Monster, and Juice Monster. The firm also owns other energy drink brands, such as Reign, NOS, Burn, and Mother, and brews and distributes beers and flavored malt beverages following the acquisition of a craft brewer in 2022. Monster controls branding and innovation but outsources beverage manufacturing and packaging to copackers and finished goods distribution to bottlers in the global Coca-Cola system (pursuant to a 20-year agreement inked in 2015). Coke is the largest shareholder of Monster with a 19.5% stake. ","We believe Monster Beverage has a pristine balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to weather macro volatilities and invest for long-term growth. The company had $3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of March 2023, only $1.1 million of outstanding balance under a $15 million credit facility, and no long-term debt. Unless the firm contemplates a major acquisition that necessitates debt financing in the future (unlikely in our view), we expect the capital structure to remain heavily skewed to equity. Cash generation is strong, with free cash flows to equity averaging 23% of sales over the past five years on the back of steady top-line growth, strong margins, and management discipline in capital expenditure. As the firm continues to optimize operational efficiency, works down its aluminum can inventory buildup driven by supply chain disruptions in recent years, and cost inflation in ingredients, packaging, and freight revert to their long-term averages in the coming years (as we expect), we have modeled Monster to maintain cash generation averaging 25% of sales over the next 10 years.

24/11/2023,TransUnion's Credit Bureau Business Gives It a Wide Moat,TransUnion,TRU,4,24/10/2023,Rajiv Bhatia,59.41,USD,24/11/2023,91.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,C,24/10/2023,"Wide-moat TransUnion reported disappointing third-quarter results as well as a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook. Third-quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS were respectively 2%, 3%, and 4% below the FactSet consensus estimates. TransUnion saw a really weak September and meaningfully took down its full-year outlook as a result. Making matters worse, it took a write-down of goodwill from its U.K. business (Callcredit) amid a challenging economy and regulatory environment there. A key debate, in our view, is if the firm is taking a big bath and thus resetting expectations, which sets up the stock favorably, or if a worsening macroeconomic environment with student loan payments resuming and interest rates spiking will result in further revenue misses. We take the former view. We expect to reduce our fair value estimate by about 10%, but we view the shares, trading at a five-year low, as cheap and offering a positive risk/reward profile. Revenue of $969 million missed the FactSet consensus estimate of $983 million and the firms outlook of $973 million-$988 million. Likewise, adjusted EBITDA of $356 million missed the FactSet consensus estimate of $367 million and the firms outlook of $361 million-$370 million. Incremental settlement charges, which are included in adjusted results, negatively affected adjusted EBITDA by $7 million.","After guidance misses and other issues, TransUnion's shares are cheap relative to peers and thus offer more room for upside.  Although the ramp-up could take many years, TransUnion has a leading position in India, the one emerging market that we believe has long-term revenue potential in line with the U.S. TransUnions growth of its emerging verticals segment (insurance, public sector, and so on) means less sensitivity to the macro environment versus the Great Recession.","Growth is primarily driven by volume, as pricing for core credit reports has typically been flat. While TransUnion was not directly involved, the breach at Equifax could lead to a more restrictive regulatory environment for all players. Managements predilection for M&A could ultimately dilute the wide moat surrounding the core business.",24/10/2023,"Along with Equifax and Experian, TransUnion is one the Big Three consumer credit bureaus. Given the fixed costs inherent in a data-intensive business, TransUnion has been able to generate meaningful margin expansion over the past several years.  TransUnion's core business is selling credit reports to U.S. lenders, but as this business is the most mature, the company has sought other avenues of growth. One avenue has been expanding beyond financial institutions into verticals such as insurance, rental screening, collections, and other sectors. The emerging verticals business was 32% of the firm's revenue in 2020, up from 21% of revenue in 2009. We believe this will help TransUnion weather a downturn as this revenue is diversified across industries and less macro-sensitive, though these items may be sensitive to coronavirus-related disruptions. TransUnion has sought to replicate its U.S. playbook internationally, as well. The most intriguing opportunity is in India, which, given the country's large population, could be an evergreen source of growth for the firm. TransUnion's early entry has allowed it to build a commanding market share in this country. While it will probably take many years to fully realize this market's potential, we think the company's leading position provides meaningful long-term upside. Since its public debut in 2015, TransUnions acquisition strategy has run the gamut from smaller bolt-on deals to larger acquisitions. Examples of bolt-on deals include Tru Optik and Signal Digital, which provide data and analytics for digital marketing. TransUnion's larger deals include its $1.4 billion acquisition of U.K. credit bureau Callcredit in 2018, its $3.1 billion acquisition of Neustar in 2021, and its $638 million of Sontiq in 2021. We believe TransUnions acquisitions have generally made strategic sense and have not weakened the firms moat.","TransUnions data is critical to the underwriting decisions of its customers (often banks), and the price of its services is negligible relative to the loan amounts at risk. We estimate that North American credit bureaus revenue represents about 1-2 basis points of total household debt. Because the accuracy and completeness of data is critical to credit decisions, lenders often pull from more than one credit bureau and we do not believe pricing is the primary factor for choosing a credit bureau. We believe the barriers to entering the credit bureau business are high, as replicating a database of millions of customers would be incredibly difficult. As the credit bureaus data is based on the voluntary reporting of thousands of financial institutions, its unlikely that a startup credit bureau, particularly with heightened data security concerns, could convince banks to share consumer information. TransUnions U.S. business (roughly 65% of the firms revenue) is split roughly evenly between traditional financial services (mortgage, auto, credit cards, and so on) and emerging verticals (insurance and other industries). Mortgage-related revenue makes up less than 10% of the firms revenue. Government agencies (Fannie and Freddie) currently require a credit report from all three bureaus, known as a tri-merge report. Given that the bulk of mortgages are agency compliant, using TransUnion (along with Equifax and Experian) is essentially a requirement for a mortgage lender. However, in October 2022, the Federal Housing Administration announced that it will work toward moving from a tri-merge to a bi-merge which would only require two credit bureau pulls. The timeline for this change is unclear. Outside of mortgage, TransUnions credit reports are deeply entrenched in auto lenders and credit card issuers workflows.The 20% of firmwide revenue that TransUnion generates outside the United States tends to be at similar adjusted EBITDA margins as the firm overall. TransUnions non-U.S. business is well diversified across geographies, with the U.K. representing about one quarter of international revenue. Canada, Latin America, and India each represent about 15%-25% of international revenue, and the remaining revenue is split between Africa and Asia-Pacific. Through its stake in CIBIL, TransUnion has a leading position in India, which we believe is one of the companys largest long-term opportunities. TransUnion generates roughly 15% of its revenue from its consumer interactive segment. It takes a two-prong approach, selling directly to consumers (direct channel) as well as through third-party partners such as Credit Karma (indirect). We view this segment as a natural extension of credit bureau operations and an additional path to monetize the moat surrounding legacy operations. ","TransUnion is exposed to the volume of mortgage and other credit applications. Tight credit markets or macroeconomic downturns in the markets it serves could reduce demand for its information. A security breach could damage the companys reputation and expose it to legal liability. Regulatory changes could limit TransUnions ability to monetize its database or increase its costs, and the risk on this front domestically is likely raised in the near term because of the high-profile breach at peer Equifax. The company relies on third parties for much of its data, and its business could be disrupted if it lost access to key data suppliers. The companys international operations create currency risk. TransUnion is also exposed to environmental, social, and governance risk; in our view, the greatest risks are in the area of data security/privacy and data accuracy. The issue of data security came to the forefront with the well-publicized breach of peer Equifax in 2017. Given the sensitive nature of consumers' data, data getting into the wrong hands can lead to adverse consequences for the credit bureaus. In addition, the credit bureaus can be controversial with the public, and the industry typically receives tens of thousands of complaints per year. From a bribery and corruption perspective, TransUnion is exposed to cultural, economic, political, and currency risks through its overseas operations.Overall, we assign TransUnion a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High.","We assess the capital allocation of TransUnion as Exemplary. In our view, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.TransUnion ended 2022 with a net leverage ratio of 3.8 times and targets a leverage ratio of less than 3.5 times by the end of 2023 and less than 3.0 times by the end of 2024. Given the firm's geographic profile and multiple use cases that credit data supports, we believe these leverage targets are appropriate. TransUnion's acquisition strategy consists of both bolt-on deals and more transformative acquisitions. TransUnion's notable deals include Neustar and Callcredit. While these deals weren't cheap, we believe they made strategic sense and the firm did not overpay. We're generally pleased with the firm's internal investments. Notably, TransUnion has modernized its data infrastructure, a move that expanded its operating margin and improved data security. We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. TransUnion's repurchase of shares in 2017 was well timed. The dividend payout has been less than 20% of earnings, and we believe the company should focus on paying down its variable-rate debt given the recent rise in rates. Compared with its peers, TransUnion has relied more on variable debt. We're a bit puzzled by this given that higher rates can also impact mortgage and consumer lending revenue. Christopher Cartwright, who joined the company in 2013 and headed its domestic credit bureau operations, has been CEO since May 2019. Cartwright has generally followed a similar course as his predecessor, James Peck. In our view, Peck charted an aggressive course that has resulted in strong growth and a material improvement in profitability.","TransUnion is one of the leading credit bureaus in the United States, providing the consumer information that is the basis for granting credit. The company also provides fraud detection, marketing, and analytical services. TransUnion operates in over 30 countries, and about a quarter of its revenue comes from international markets.","TransUnion ended the first half of 2023 with a net leverage ratio of 3.8 times. Leverage spiked following the Callcredit acquisition (4.5 times proforma during the second quarter of 2018), which was financed with debt. The companys operations are fairly stable and cash flow generation is strong, which mitigates any concerns we might have on this front. We expect the firm to deleverage as its leverage is elevated from the Neustar transaction.TransUnion initiated a dividend in 2018, but the initial payout ratio comes to only about 20%, by our estimate, and we dont see this move as materially affecting the companys flexibility or marking a major shift in capital allocation. We expect the bulk of the companys free cash flow will continue to be used for acquisitions and reducing debt. After 2017, the firm hit the brakes on share repurchases, and we're supportive of this, given its rising valuation and rising variable debt.

24/11/2023,We Think RB Global Can Use Its Strong Service Record to Improve IAA's Business,RB Global Inc,RBA,3,10/11/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,84.36,CAD,23/11/2023,76.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,10/11/2023,"RB Global reported solid third-quarter earnings, but the loss of customers at IAA led us to temper our near-term sales expectations. As a result, we lowered our fair value estimate to $55 from $57. Management commented that the customer loss made up roughly 4% of total gross transaction value annually and approximately 5% of total unit volumes. That said, we were encouraged by managements comments about its new approach to managing service-level agreements. The company is working to build more accountability among managers to help drive better execution of SLAs. The key concern among insurance carrier customers was IAAs inability to provide consistent and effective services. We think RB Global can use its strong service track record on the heavy equipment side to improve IAAs operations over time. This gives us the confidence to forecast mid-single-digit sales growth from 2024-27. Were not expecting IAA to win back the biggest customers it lost any time soon, but we do think the company can gain ground among smaller insurance companies. Turning to the quarter, GTV increased 17% year on year on a pro forma basis thanks to stronger volumes across all segments. One key area of growth was automotive GTV, which was up 11% year over year on higher volumes and stronger average selling prices. For the fourth quarter, management is expecting a high-single-digit to low-teens growth rate for GTV.  Service revenue was up 20% year on year, largely due to strong GTV growth and a higher take rate on service revenue. The latter data point came in at 20%, up approximately 60 basis points compared with the same period a year ago. The key drivers to take-rate expansion were stronger buyer fees and marketplace revenue. Overall, we continue to remain positive about the RB Global story, despite the challenges in IAAs business. RB Global will have to improve operations first and then convince insurance carriers that IAA can consistently service all their needs.","Increasing construction activity could lead equipment owners to buy new machines and sell their used equipment through RB Global's auctions, substantially boosting revenue growth. Equipment owners may feel more comfortable putting their machines up for sale as the economic environment improves, strengthening RB Globals auction liquidity. RB Globals success operating in a fully online environment during the pandemic might convince more buyers to leave other machinery-focused websites for its auctions, which could boost the companys profitability.","Equipment owners could continue to hold back on putting their assets up for sale, which would result in RB Globals auction liquidity being constrained. The new U.S. infrastructure deal may lead equipment owners to hang on to older equipment to meet increased demand for infrastructure projects. A shortage of used equipment would pressure sales growth for RB Global. Online competitors could improve the digital experience of their virtual auctions, providing customers little reason to seek out other alternatives. This may cap RB Globals revenue growth potential.",10/11/2023,"RB Global provides auction and marketplace services for used heavy equipment. The companys strong auction liquidity attracts both buyers and sellers to its network. We believe RB Global will continue to be the top player in the industrial asset disposition market. The network effects present in its business have consistently delivered higher average selling prices for consignors (or sellers) and provided buyers a wide range of equipment to choose from. For both parties, RB Global drives significant amount of value, which has allowed it to monetize its network effects and develop a strong competitive positioning.  RB Globals strategy going forward is to move its business from being primarily transaction based to more solutions based. It has developed digital solutions that range from inventory management solutions for buyers to market intelligence tools for sellers. The company is also pushing to provide more services to customers, such as financing, parts and services, and appraisal and inspection services. While these services have the potential to drive higher profitability, we think it will be challenging to drive adoption rates higher in the near term. Customers will need to be convinced of the value that add-on services can bring to their buying or selling experience. Furthermore, the company is extending into the auto salvage market with its acquisition of IAA. The new vertical has attractive tailwinds, but IAA has struggled in recent years, losing market share to its largest competitor, Copart.  The company has exposure to attractive tailwinds in the near term. Construction equipment makes up 20% of the equipment sold through RB Global. In economic upturns, equipment owners often opt to sell their older equipment to buy new. RB Global also benefits when markets are pressured, and asset owners look to increase liquidity through asset disposals (such as bankruptcies). We believe used-equipment supply will continue to loosen in the near term and lead to greater auction liquidity for RB Global. ","We assign RB Global a narrow economic moat rating, primarily based on the network effects present in its industrial equipment auctions. In our view, network effects occur when the value of a good or service increases for both new and existing users as more customers use that good or service. We believe the value that RB Global provides users in its network is auction liquidity. We define auction liquidity as the number of users interacting with the network and the level of user activity (engagement). For decades, the company has been adept at attracting both buyers and sellers to its auctions and has steadily grown user activity (bidder registrations, lots sold, bids per lot). Together, these factors have led to RB Global becoming the market leader in auction liquidity. By all measures, the value of the companys services has increased as more customers have either bought or sold equipment on its auctions. RB Globals two-sided network effects have created a virtuous cycle, making it a prime example of the ""flywheel"" effect. On the supply side, there are two main benefits for sellers who elect to sell their assets on RB Global's auctions. First, the companys strong auction liquidity helps sellers realize higher selling prices. The higher volume of buyers on RB Globals network often leads to more bids per lot than on smaller auctions. As bids per lot increase, equipment prices typically march higher, which ultimately leads to sellers netting higher proceeds. Second, RB Global extends sellers reach beyond their home market. This gives sellers access to new markets globally, increasing their ability to reach more buyers than they could on regional auctions. On the demand side, RB Global provides buyers access to a wide range of equipment, in addition to high equipment availability. Equipment verticals include construction, agricultural, oilfield, and transportation assets. The high volume of sellers within RB Globals network provides ample opportunity for buyers to bid on equipment, reducing the risk of not winning a bid. These factors illustrate not only the value that both buyers and sellers realize by participating in RB Globals network, but it also shows that as more buyers and sellers enter the network, the value of RB Globals services increase for both existing and new users. We believe the high volume of buyers on RB Globals network draws more sellers to the marketplace. As more sellers join the network, that in turn attracts additional buyers to sign up, creating a flywheel effect.RB Global is highly effective at monetizing the value it provides to both buyers and sellers. In fact, the companys monetization rates have trended higher over time, showing users are increasingly finding value on RB Globals auctions. A key monetization rate for RB Global is its core auction rate (service revenue as a percent of gross transaction value), which stood over 17% in 2022, up from 11% in 2010. The components of the core auction rate are the commissions and fees earned on equipment transactions. The majority of commissions are negotiated at a fixed rate of the gross selling price. We believe the value provided on RB Globals network allows it to negotiate higher commission rates than competitors with weaker auction liquidity. The balance of commissions is categorized as underwritten contracts, where RB Global guarantees sellers a minimum level of return. With regards to fees, the company charges sellers for listing assets on its marketplace. For buyers, RB Global charges a fee when transactions are completed. RB Global controls about 20% of the $30 billion used heavy equipment auction market, with strong opportunities to gain more share. The auction market is highly fragmented and offers plenty of opportunities for RB Global to grow both organically and inorganically. As the largest player, the company provides its customers stronger auction liquidity than smaller players. We believe competitors will struggle to win market share as sellers will opt to sell their assets through RB Global, where theyll likely get the better selling prices. In our view, this will allow RB Global to not only maintain its strong market share position, but also expand it. M&A has also been a lever that has driven market share growth. In 2017, RB Global acquired IronPlanet, an online marketplace. This move expanded its reach into online auctions, which gives customers an option of where theyd like to buy or sell equipment. We believe this eases the concerns around online marketplaces competing away returns from RB Global live auction business. We do not think RB Global faces any substantial threats from ESG risks. As a service provider, it does not have direct exposure to the product safety issues, carbon emissions, and environmental regulation that original equipment manufacturers face. The company does, however, have relatively medium exposure to product governance issues, based on research from Morningstar Sustainalytics, a division that provides sustainability research. Its important for processes to be in place to prevent service quality from deteriorating and negatively affecting customers. We believe RB Global has the systems in place to not only deal with service issues as they arise, but also the ability to drive higher service quality through its sales team reorganization. Before, the company operated under a territory manager model, where one individual had multiple responsibilities. Today, management is actively transitioning the selling model into more isolated roles. These roles include an account manager, a business development manager, and an inside territory manager. We think this will help focus the sales team and drive greater efficiencies in the business, and ultimately better service quality for customers. Therefore, we do not view the product governance risk as material enough to include in our valuation.","We assign RB Global a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The company is susceptible to swings in the heavy equipment industry. While cycle upturns typically result in equipment owners selling off older equipment to buy newer, used-equipment supply can sometimes become constrained (the current supply crunch has strained equipment volumes). This was the case in 2017 and 2018, when RB Global saw extraordinary supply shortages of used equipment. The proliferation of infrastructure projects pushed construction activity higher, leading equipment owners to hang on to their machines longer to meet increased demand. Used-equipment supply shortages can also occur when original equipment manufacturers production levels lag end user demand. Each of these potential outcomes would likely result in RB Global losing some auction liquidity (a decline in consignor and buyer growth). A key question for RB Global going forward will be its strategy to fend off competition from online players. Today, there are numerous machinery-focused websites that both buyers and sellers can utilize, serving as an alternative to RB Globals live, unreserved auctions. As buyers become more comfortable inspecting and evaluating equipment online, the live auction format may start to see decreasing auction liquidity. Having said that, we think RB Global's 2017 move to acquire IronPlanet, an online auction player, put it in a good position to respond to changing buyer preferences. Even then, we think the online threat is low given online buyers made up nearly 60% of live auctions in 2019 (prepandemic), showing a majority of customers are comfortable evaluating equipment online. For example, buyers on RB Globals auctions can participate in virtual yard walks to evaluate equipment quality. We also think its unreserved auction format can net sellers higher average selling prices, thanks to its strong auction liquidity.","We assign RB Global a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is fair and supports its competitive positioning. We also think RB Globals shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think RB Global has a sound balance sheet. The companys low balance sheet risk is largely due to its manageable debt levels and access to credit lines. In the longer term, we expect its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio to be low with manageable near-term debt maturities. The company has taken on debt (over $3 billion) to partially fund its acquisition of IAA (a vehicle auction player).RB Globals investment strategy is fair, in our view. We think future investments will mostly be focused on improving its hybrid go-to market strategy. Management is committed to growing its online business, a complement to its traditional business, live auctions. Regardless of how and where customers would like to interact with RB Global, theyll have an avenue to do so. We think management will take its experience operating satellite sites in Australia to other regions, helping increase its global footprint. The challenge for prospective sellers is the transportation costs they need to incur to sell their assets through RB Global. This isnt an issue in areas where RB Global is well penetrated such as North America. Sellers assets travel short distances, making it worthwhile for them to take on the transportation costs in the hopes of realizing a high selling price for their assets. Satellite sites can attract new sellers to RB Globals auctions. As new sellers join the network, this in turn could draw new buyers in those regions to the platform. Ultimately, the addition of international buyers and sellers can potentially grow online traffic on RB Globals network, increasing the value of its auction services for all users. With regards to acquisitions, we think the company will be open to making future deals to boost its digital capabilities. Digital solutions can also be another lever of profit growth, but we think RB Global will need to invest significantly to deliver services that will drive material customer adoption. On Nov. 7, 2022, RB Global announced its acquisition of IAA for $6.9 billion. We revised the deal price down from $7.3 billion initially after accounting for IAAs 2022 financials to value IAAs enterprise value. The deal expands RB Globals reach into the salvage vehicle market. Recent deals have been focused on acquiring new capabilities, but the IAA deal looks to be a play to scale its services into an adjacent vertical. We think RB Global paid up a bit for the acquisition, based on our analysis of FactSet consensus EBITDA expectation. The purchase price represents an 12.2 EV/2023 EBITDA multiple (excluding synergies). Our estimate of the multiple was revised down from 13.4 times initially after accounting for IAAs 2022 financials to value IAAs enterprise value. RB Global is targeting run-rate cost synergies (mostly SG&A cost reductions) to reach between $100 million-$120 million by 2025. On Jan. 23, 2023, RB Global revised the deal, adding an additional $2.80 per share in cash considerations for IAA shareholders. In addition, management brought in a strategic partner, Starboard Value LP, which is investing $500 million ($485 million in preferred shares (nonvoting) and $15 million in common stock). RB Global recently declared a special dividend of $1.08 per share upon the closing of the IAA deal. In 2017, RB Global bought IronPlanet for $776 million, representing a transaction multiple of 13 times enterprise value/2017 adjusted EBITDA. Management believed the deal could bring RB Global approximately $100 million in tax synergies and roughly $20 million in cost synergies. The company has realized most of these synergies since. We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. Historically, RB Global has allocated more capital toward dividends than share repurchases, but we think management will look to buy back more shares in the future as free cash continues to grow, in addition to increasing its regular dividend. In the years when the company repurchased shares, nearly $45 million was returned to shareholders on average. We think RB Global will surpass that level in future years, averaging over $58 million in share repurchases over our explicit forecast.","RB Global operates the worlds largest auction for heavy equipment. The company started as a live auctioneer of industrial equipment, since then it has greatly expanded its operations to include the sale of construction, agricultural, oilfield, and transportation equipment. RB Global operates over 40 live auction sites in more than 12 countries, along with online marketplaces, including IronPlanet, Marketplace-E, and GovPlanet. Its agricultural auctions are frequently much smaller venues and can include liquidations of single farms. The company holds over 300 auctions yearly and sells $6 billion worth of equipment.","RB Global's total debt at the end of its fiscal third quarter stood at $3.1 billion. The company issued over $3 billion in debt to fund its acquisition of IAA. Management signaled initially that net leverage would rise to about 3 times pro-forma-adjusted EBITDA. Today, net leverage sits at 2.4 times. In the past, the company has shown the ability to deleverage quickly, thanks to the cash generative nature of its business. We think management can get leverage down to roughly 2 times in the next couple of years. In our cash flow model, were expecting the company to generate nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in our midcycle year, supporting its ability to bring debt levels down.RB Global also provides financial services to its customers by matching them with lenders (it receives a fee for acting as broker). Management has expressed interest in expanding its financial services to get access to assets that will likely be sold through bankruptcies. We think RB Global will work to leverage its partnership with Gordon Brothers, an investment firm focused on working with businesses dealing with insolvency issues. By using its excess capital, RB Global can potentially bring additional assets to its auctions to be sold off, but we think this is more of a long-term opportunity rather than an immediate value driver. In terms of liquidity, we believe the company can meet its near-term debt obligations given its strong cash balance. The companys cash position as of the third quarter stood at $428 million on its balance sheet. We also find comfort in its ability to tap into available lines of credit to meet any short-term needs. The company has access to $709 million in credit facilities. In our view, it maintains a strong financial position with a clean balance sheet.",RBA.TO,Industrials,16357092352.0,TOR,287544.0,CAD,85.16999816894531,True,0,85.3149998982738,91.21390254323049,1
24/11/2023,Zebras Sticky Solutions Enable Logistics Digital Transformation and Merit a Narrow Moat,Zebra Technologies Corp,ZBRA,4,31/10/2023,William Kerwin,225.86,USD,23/11/2023,345.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,31/10/2023,"We maintain our $345 fair value estimate for shares of narrow-moat Zebra Technologies after third-quarter results were expectedly weak. Zebra is dealing with soft demand across its served markets, as customers push out new orders and refresh amid budget tightening. We see these dynamics affecting the firm through the next few quarters, but we continue to view this as pushed-out, not cancelled, demand. We believe Zebra's solutions are critical to customers and embed deeply in their organizations, making order refreshes a matter of when, not if. We see shares as materially undervalued. Third-quarter sales dropped 31% year over year and 21% sequentially to $960 million. All of Zebra's served markets, geographies, and segments declined both year over year and sequentially. The firm's weakness is most pronounced in its mobile computers for larger retail and transportation customers, especially e-commerce providers like Amazon. Customers are opting to extend the useful lives of Zebra's equipment in order to reduce expenses against softer end-consumer demand. Elsewhere, Zebra's distribution partners are slowing their own orders to clear inventory built up during pandemic-era demand. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 100 basis points year over year and 320 basis points sequentially to 44.8%, primarily due to weak volume. Positively, Zebra is no longer dealing with elevated supply chain costs that have weighed on gross margin the past two years, and we believe pricing should be a tailwind to gross margin over the next year. Fourth-quarter guidance was weak and within our expectations. Zebra expects sales to drop more than 30% year over year, which still implies sequential improvement from the third quarter. We expect results through the income statement to improve sequentially now through 2024, but for an overall recovery to be gradual. Zebra isn't expecting meaningful recovery in the first half of 2024 but did see distributor destocking peak in the third quarter.","Zebra derives 80% of its sales from a robust ecosystem of channel partners, which can customize its technology to specific subverticals. Zebra has the largest share of the AIDC market with over 40%, per VDC Research. Zebras pivot into software should enable it to pursue higher-growth opportunities, expand margins, and heighten switching costs at end customers.","One third of Zebras revenue comes from its legacy printing segment, which faces greater risk of commoditization. Despite pivoting into software, Zebra classifies only 25% of its revenue as recurring, meaning it still relies on continuously competing for customer contracts. Zebra is pursuing numerous expansion markets outside of its core competencies, like machine vision, and could face risk related to mission creep and spreading its investments too thin.",01/08/2023,"We see Zebra Technologies as a crucial partner for supply chain, logistics, and operational efficiency for customers across industry verticals. Zebra has acquired and maintained a dominant share position in the automatic identification and data capture, or AIDC, market (inclusive of printing, scanning, and mobile computing) by pivoting into higher-growth technologies over its life. We agree with the firms ongoing pivot into software, developing platforms internally and through acquisitions to augment and complement its existing portfolio.  We think Zebras pivot into software will give it access to higher-growth markets, help expand gross margins, and create a stickier overall solution with customers. In our view, the firm already has the most comprehensive AIDC portfolio in the world, which allows it to provide customers with deeply specialized and customized offerings to optimize their workflows. Layering prescriptive software with machine learning and artificial intelligence on top of these solutions allows customers to focus on activities with higher return on investment and creates a stickier solution by further embedding Zebras technology in customer processes. We think Zebras custom solutions give rise to steep customer switching costs, which underpin our narrow economic moat rating.  We expect Zebra to benefit from ongoing secular trends toward digitization and automation, notably in omnichannel retail and e-commerce, which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and is a tailwind for the firm. We think the firms highest-growth opportunities will come from further building out its software portfolio and growing its base of recurring revenue, as well as from expanding its footprint in the healthcare market as health records and hospital workflows become digitized. The firms balance sheet looks strong to us, and management is now committing capital to bolt-on acquisitions and its heady research and development budget.","We award Zebra Technologies a narrow economic moat rating. We think its customers bear steep switching costs as Zebras solutions are deeply embedded in workflows and processes. With its end-to-end portfolio of specialized products and integration of software, we think Zebras customers would face monetary cost and significant time investment to switch AIDC vendors, in addition to risking efficiency losses. As such, we think Zebra will be able to earn excess returns on invested capital for the better part of the next decade. The AIDC market comprises a family of technologies that identify, verify, record, communicate, and store information. Well-known examples of AIDC technology include bar codes, QR codes, RFID, and biometric scanning; the value that AIDC adds comes from integrating these technologies into workflows to optimize efficiency. AIDC technology is crucial to implementing efficient supply chains and in-store operations, and Zebra primarily serves the retail, transportation logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare markets. It is our view that switching costs in enterprise hardware systems typically result from deeply integrated solutions that spread across several touch points of an organization. Zebra has an end-to-end portfolio of specialized AIDC solutions that enables it to achieve a wide footprint within its customers. In fact, among the leading 20 global AIDC providers, Zebra is the only one to offer solutions in each of the five main product categories, per VDC Research: barcode printing, handheld scanners, stationary scanners, RFID, and mobile computers. Zebra solutions typically comprise a combination of these capabilities, all integrated together with proprietary software. In each bucket of Zebras portfolio, its products are highly specialized. For example, the firm sells several dozen different mobile computers, among them handheld devices, wearables, tablets, and vehicle-mounted units. Even within each form factor, different computers are designed for different use cases: inventory management, communication, price checking, route optimization, proof of delivery, and self checkout, to name a few. Each customers solution set is uniquely tailored by Zebra or a channel partner to fit its business, and having the largest set of specialized tools allows Zebra to provide its customers with the highest degree of customization. In collaborating with its customers to build customized systems, Zebra embeds itself deeply in their workflows. If a customer were using a single Zebra barcode printer, it wouldnt be very difficult to switch vendors. However, when a customer is using a Zebra solution, adopting printers, scanners, and differently customized mobile computers for different parts of the organization to all work seamlessly together, a customer would have to at least partially redesign its system and workflow, and the task becomes much more arduous. Because Zebra has the broadest solution set in the industry, it can plug into more parts of an organization, and create an even more entrenched system--all while increasing customer productivity. A customer looking to switch away from Zebra would incur significant time investment from retraining employees, financial costs from running two systems simultaneously during the transition, and the opportunity cost of halted or slowed productivity as the new systems kinks are slowly worked out. Additionally, if a customer wanted to replace Zebra, it may have to find multiple vendors to accomplish the same tasks or face limits to its future capabilities. A Zebra replacement might be lacking in printing or RFID ability, for example, which would mean finding multiple vendors to accomplish what Zebra could do by itself. Zebra creates an even more integrated--and thus entrenched--system for its customers by layering software on top of its solutions. While Zebras hardware forms the arms and legs of a customers system--printing and scanning tags--the software, or brain, is what drives the bulk of the efficiency. Zebra has numerous software offerings that integrate into its products, both organically generated or acquired through M&A, that range from mobile device management and security to artificial intelligence and machine learning for prescriptive analytics. The firms internally developed Savanna platform stores and organizes the massive amounts of data brought in from a customers mobile computers, scanners, and printers, which can then all be fed into Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze and provide real-time recommendations. For example, in a retail store, an associate could scan an out-of-stock items barcode, and ZPA could instantly assign the task of restocking to the closest idle employee to the items back-of-store location. While this is a simple example, Zebras solutions allow employees to focus uniquely on the highest-ROI activity at any given time. Zebra also has myriad other specialized software solutions to improve efficiency, whether its reducing empty space in a delivery truck with Zebra SmartPack or improving in-store communication with Workforce Connect, an internal unified communications solution on Zebra mobile computers. When tailoring a Zebra system to a customers needs, the software allows all the hardware to integrate into one cohesive system. Zebra or its channel partners will help orient Zebra software to customers exact business needs, and in some cases will help customers write new applications on top of Zebras modified Android OS.In integrating practical software into its hardware solutions, Zebra creates a compelling use case with customers, all while creating a much stickier product. A customer wanting to switch away from Zebra would not only need to redesign workflows around new hardware with different capabilities, but also need to either redesign applications or programs on top of a new vendors software, design an in-house solution, or forgo software altogether. All of these alternatives would lead to financial costs, significant time investment in training employees, and steep risks of lower efficiency than was experienced with Zebra.While competing firms have AIDC software for device management and ad hoc applications, Zebra has shown a commitment to building out advanced machine learning and AI capabilities to extract further efficiency gains at its customers. In our view, Zebra is as of yet unmatched in its software depth in the industry, and we think it will be difficult for competitors to catch up. Zebra consistently outspends its competitors on R&D--both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue--and the majority of this budget goes into software, as more than 70% of Zebras engineers are software engineers. By our estimates, Honeywell is the only competitor that comes within sniffing distance of Zebras hefty R&D budget, and we estimate Zebra outspends Honeywell on AIDC R&D by over $100 million per year. The firm is also pursuing software enhancements externally, with its recent acquisitions being angled toward pure-play software firmslike Reflexis in 2020 for $575 million. As one example of Zebras value proposition and switching costs, Ford Motor adopted Zebra to reduce excess or obsolete inventory as well as downtime at a manufacturing plant. In lieu of the auto industrys ubiquitous but paper-based Kanban system, Zebra and Ford codeveloped a new system using Zebras real-time locating system to locate parts and bring them to the manufacturing line at the appropriate time. The new system applied wireless tags to each part, as well as fixed-position antennas around the plant, and implemented a central software dashboard to locate any part in a 250,000-square-foot facility within 10 feet of precision. When a line workers inventory runs below a certain threshold, he or she simply has to press a button and the system will locate another employee best suited to refresh the inventory based on part location, employee location, and status of the employees current workload. The system even works across Ford facilities, with tags tracking parts moving from one facility to the next. Ford credits the new system for saving $500,000 per facility by making it easier to find parts and reducing downtime.In the case of Ford and other Zebra customers, the value that Zebra adds is in becoming an integrated portion of their internal processes. For Ford, its entire manufacturing plant process is underpinned by Zebra technology, meaning that ripping out Zebra means redesigning the entire process top to bottom. If a customer wanted to switch away from Zebra into another AIDC provider, it would face significant switching costs, including the financial cost of installing a new system, the time spent getting employees up to speed, and the risk of delays or halts in production as a result of fine-tuning a new system. Finally (and perhaps most significantly), a customer would face the risk of a less efficient solution than the incumbent Zebra system.","We assign Zebra a High Uncertainty Rating. Zebras top line ultimately depends on capital expenditures at customers as they build out or refresh their back-end workflows. In a macroeconomic downturn that depresses GDP growth and causes customer capital investment to decline, Zebras ability to generate revenue growth would slow. Zebra has also relied on hefty R&D investment and add-on acquisitions to fuel top-line growth and stave off competition; any slowdown in these activities could open the firm up to a greater competitive threat.Zebra faces significant risk from digital transformation in the AIDC industry, notably with its pivot into software. At the end of 2020, the market began pricing Zebra stock at multiples more in line with software firms, despite the company's low base of recurring revenue (25% of sales). If Zebra isnt able to realize its ambitions to expand its proportion of recurring revenue, the market could price in a substantially lower multiple. We also think the AIDC markets transition to software will expose Zebra to the threats of open-source software and of a well-capitalized software giant entering the market, though wed point to Zebras expansive patches to Android for enterprise use as a hedge against the open-source threat.Zebra has a global manufacturing and selling footprint and previously faced risk from its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. However, Zebra has alleviated this pressure in recent years and now has full manufacturing redundancy for every product line, which will mitigate the risk of international tariffs or trade disputes with China.We foresee little to no environmental, social, or governance risk for Zebra. The firm even has a device buyback and recycling program to reduce downstream landfill waste from old devices.","We assign Zebra a Standard capital allocation rating, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and mixed shareholder distributions. We think pursuing growth opportunities by investing in new technologies, both organically and inorganically, will be the driving force behind shareholder returns in our forecast. We think Zebras balance sheet is sound, based on low net debt relative to both EBITDA and our assessment of enterprise value. We think free cash flow will more than cover debt maturities through 2024 and expect the firm to remain in its target debt/EBITDA range of 1.5-2.5 as it uses leverage to fund growth. We think the firms investments are fair. Zebra has done a good job of identifying acquisitions that bolster its competitive position, namely its recent history of software M&A. We are wary of the firms ability to succeed in adjacent markets outside of its core competencies it entered via acquisitions, like machine vision and automated robots. We dont see any underinvestment risk in the organic business, however, and see these as helping Zebra create ever more comprehensive solutions.We think the firms record of shareholder distributions is mixed. Historically, Zebra hasnt paid a dividend or conducted share repurchases. Since its large Motorola deal in 2014, we think management rightly focused on using cash to pay down its debt. We like managements new focus on share repurchases alongside managing its debt load.","Zebra Technologies is a leading provider of automatic identification and data capture technology to enterprises. Its solutions include barcode printers and scanners, mobile computers, and workflow optimization software. The firm primarily serves the retail, transportation logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare markets, designing custom solutions to improve efficiency at its customers.","We expect Zebra to focus on its working capital efficiency and generating free cash flow, though we expect it may take on additional leverage to fund future acquisitions. The firm was highly leveraged following its 2014 acquisition of Motorola Solutions enterprise division, but in the years following it has steadily paid down its debt. As of Dec. 31, 2022, the firm carried $2 billion in debt and $105 million in cash. We dont foresee liquidity challenges for the firm, with about $1.4 billion available through its revolving credit facility and long-dated debt not due until 2027. We also note its ratio of net debt/trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of 1.6 times, well below the top of its target range of 2.5 times. We forecast Zebra to generate well over $1 billion in free cash flow each year through 2027, excluding a challenging 2023. We expect the firms strong cash generation to allow it to easily service its obligations. With the remainder, we expect the firm to pursue additional bolt-on acquisitions and conduct opportunistic share repurchases. However, we dont anticipate a transformative deal (like Motorola) in the short term and anticipate Zebra to remain in its target debt/EBITDA range. We make a final note that Zebra engages in receivables factoring, mostly in its operations in Europe, to help fund working capital.",ZBRA,Technology,12392556544.0,NMS,419616.0,USD,225.8600006103516,True,1,238.9482351864141,260.84629558045435,1
25/11/2023,Teslas Technological Advantage Will Remain in Place as EV Adoption Grows,Tesla Inc,TSLA,3,19/10/2023,Seth Goldstein,234.21,USD,23/11/2023,210.0,Very High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,19/10/2023,"Tesla's earnings showed the effect of the company's price cuts as operating income fell more than 50% from the prior-year quarter despite 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our annual forecast had already included the profit decline as we expected price cuts would continue to weigh on profits and margins. However, we have trimmed our near-term forecast to account for further price cuts in the fourth quarter and lower margins in 2024 as Tesla ramps up Cybertruck production. Our long-term outlook remains intact that Tesla will be able to fully restore automotive gross profit margins as the company is able to reduce its unit production costs and ramp up sales of its autonomous driving subscription software. Having updated our model to reflect our lower near-term outlook, we have trimmed our Tesla fair value estimate to $210 per share from $215 per share. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. Tesla's stock was down over 4% in afterhours trading as the market reacted negatively to the profit decline and management's commentary that suggests lower automotive gross profit margins next year. However, at current prices, shares trade roughly 10% above our updated fair value estimate. Accordingly, we suggest investors wait for a larger pullback in the stock and for shares to offer a solid margin of safety before we recommend an entry point. Tesla plans to begin Cybertruck deliveries at the end of November while ramping up production of the light-duty truck. Similar to the Model 3 ramp-up, we think automotive profit margins will likely be temporarily affected by higher initial unit production costs in the remainder of 2023 and in 2024. However, as production scales, the truck should become profitable and help drive margin expansion in the following years.","Tesla has the potential to disrupt the automotive and power generation industries with its technology for EVs, AVs, batteries, and solar generation systems. Tesla will see higher profit margins as it reduces unit production costs over the next several years. Through the combination of Teslas industry-leading technology and its unique supercharger network, the companys EVs offer the best function of any on the market, which should help Tesla maintain its market-leader status as EV adoption increases.","Traditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily in EV development, which will result in Tesla seeing a deceleration in sales growth and being forced to cut prices due to increased competition, eroding profit margins. Tesla's reliance on batteries made in China for its lower-price Model 3 vehicles will hurt sales as these autos will not qualify for U.S. subsidies. Solar panel and battery prices will decline faster than Tesla can reduce costs, resulting in little to no profits for the energy generation and storage business.",19/10/2023,"Tesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world. In less than a decade, the company went from a startup to a globally recognized luxury automaker with its Model S and Model X vehicles. The company also competes in the entry-level luxury car and midsize crossover SUV markets with its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Tesla also plans to sell new vehicles over the next several years, including a light truck, a semi truck, a sports car, and an affordable sedan and SUV. Tesla aims to maintain its market leader status as EVs grow from a niche market to reaching mass consumer adoption. We forecast EVs will reach 40% of global auto sales by 2030. To meet growing demand, Tesla opened two new factories in 2022, which increased its production capacity. Tesla also invests around 4% of its sales in research and development, focusing on improving its market-leading technology and reducing its manufacturing costs. For EVs to see mass adoption, they need to reach cost and function parity with internal combustion engines. To reduce costs, Tesla focuses on automation and efficiency in its manufacturing process, such as reducing the total number of parts that need to be assembled in a vehicle. The company also began designing its own batteries. Tesla's goal is to reduce costs by over 50%. To reach functional parity, EVs will need to have adequate range, reduced charging times, and availability of charging infrastructure. Teslas extended-range EVs are already at range parity with ICE vehicles. The company also continues to expand its supercharging network, which consists of fast chargers built along highways and in cities throughout the U.S., EU, and China. The range and supercharger network help eliminate road trip anxiety, or the functional barrier to mass market EV adoption. Tesla is also attempting to take a larger share of its customers auto-related spending, which includes selling insurance and offering paid services such as autonomous driving software. Tesla also sells solar panels and batteries used for energy storage to consumers and utilities. As the solar generation and battery storage market expands, Tesla is well positioned to grow accordingly.","We award Tesla a narrow moat rating. Teslas moat stems from two of our five moat sources: intangible assets and cost advantage. The companys strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise allows the company to make its vehicles cheaper than its competitors.Intangible AssetsTeslas brand cachet is not likely to be impaired anytime soon as other automakers move into the battery electric vehicle space because we expect the company to keep innovating to stay ahead of startup and established competitors. The Model S Plaid, the most upgraded version of Teslas luxury sedan, offers 390 miles of range, which is at the high end for electric vehicles. It does 0-60 mph in under 2 seconds and has 1,020 horsepower, putting the Model S Plaid in a rare class of performance among all autos, regardless of powertrain. By focusing on the luxury auto market first, Tesla was able to create tremendous media publicity for the company that reaches beyond its customers. This generated strong consumer demand for its subsequent vehicles at lower price points, such as the Model 3 and Model Y. As other new vehicles are launched, such as the Cybertruck or the platform that will produce the affordable sedan and SUV (known as the $25,000 vehicle), we expect the companys strong brand will continue to generate consumer demand.Tesla has a more high-tech vehicle with the ability to do drivetrain updates and other updates via Wi-Fi or a cellular connection, and customers do not have to visit a store for many service needs. Tesla will instead pick up the vehicle from home and often return it the same day, while providing a fully loaded loaner for no charge, or visit the customer's home or work and service the car there. This experience is much easier than many other automakers' service, which helps Tesla's brand equity. Further, this has been accomplished with little to no spending on advertising, which is rare for a consumer brand. This strong brand equity has carried over to Teslas energy generation and storage business, where the company can charge a premium for its fully integrated solar panel, inverter, and home battery storage systems sold to consumers.Teslas proprietary technology contributes to its intangible asset-driven competitive advantage. This form of intangible assets applies to EVs due to their innovative, highly engineered nature and because patents for EV technologies hold somewhat less value due to the ability of competitors to create alternatively designed, but ultimately similar, products. Since launching the Model S in 2012, Tesla has been the industry leader in electric vehicles, producing the best EVs on the market. The company invests nearly 6% of sales in R&D to maintain its best-in-class range, which is well ahead of the competition on a miles per kilowatt-hour basis and continues to improve other vehicle specs such as power. Tesla is also investing heavily in its proprietary autonomous vehicle technology and building one of the worlds largest supercomputers to train self-driving artificial intelligence. With R&D spending in line with its peers, we think Tesla will be able to maintain its proprietary technological advantage.Tesla will face increasing competition in the coming years. Automakers plan to electrify their fleets by adding EV versions of existing vehicles and creating new platforms. However, we see EVs becoming a greater proportion of auto sales, growing to 30% by 2030, up from 3% in 2020, which will expand the market as EVs rapidly take share from internal combustion engine vehicles. As new models are introduced, Teslas technological advantage and the strength of its brand will remain intact, which will allow the company to continue to charge a premium price for its EVs.Cost AdvantageWe think Tesla benefits from a cost advantage in electric vehicles production thanks to its manufacturing scale. Teslas total vehicle volume has grown from just over 100,000 in 2017 to over 1.3 million deliveries in 2022. During the same period, the companys average cost of goods sold per vehicle has fallen over 50%, from $84,000 to under $39,000, and gross profit margins have expanded from 20% to 26% excluding the sale of regulatory credits. While some of this is due to manufacturing a greater proportion of midsize cars and SUVs versus luxury autos, the majority of the COGS decline has come from the companys focus on reducing manufacturing costs due to scale. Legacy automakers are gradually transitioning to BEV production from internal combustion engines, but we expect they will be saddled with legacy ICE costs for a long time. Even as legacy automakers begin to produce more EVs, we expect Tesla will continue to have lower costs as it has outlined a plan to further reduce battery cell costs by 56% over the next several years. With Teslas cost per vehicle set to fall, incumbent automakers may take years to catch up to Tesla, if ever, as they wont want to build many new factories from scratch like Tesla is doing.We think Teslas combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist in the future and allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital. We see the potential for Tesla to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years, which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating. However, the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry, given the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies that could transform how consumers use vehicles. As such, we view a narrow moat rating, which assumes a 10-year excess return duration, as more appropriate.","We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company.The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As the EV market leader, Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants. As new lower-priced EVs enter the market, Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing the firm's industry-leading profits. With more EV choices, consumers may view Tesla less favorably. The firm is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns. The company is also investing in R&D in an attempt to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. Teslas CEO owns a little over 20% of the company's stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt.Tesla faces environmental, social, and governance risks. As an automaker, Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in recalls, including its autonomous driving software. We see a moderate impact should this occur. Another risk involves employee retention. If Tesla is unable to retain key employees, such as CEO Elon Musk, its favorable brand image could decline. Should the company not be able to retain production line employees, it could see delays. We see a low probability but moderate materiality for both risks.Additional ESG risks include potential patent litigation as the company relies on new technology to improve its EVs and energy storage systems. We see a low probability but moderate materiality should this occur. Tesla may also face regulatory issues in some U.S. states due to laws that require automakers and dealers to be separate. We see a moderate probability but low materiality.","We award Tesla an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on our framework that assesses its balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We rate the balance sheet as sound. Teslas revenue is subject to high cyclicality, and the majority of the companys debt and financial lease obligations are due within the next three years. However, with a healthy balance sheet and cash exceeding total debt, Tesla should be able to easily meet its financial obligations.We view management's investments as exceptional. Teslas aspiration is to increase its EV volume from a little over 1.3 million vehicles in 2022 to 20 million by 2030. To do so, the company built new factories around the world, including in China, the EU, and U.S. Given strong consumer demand, we think the capacity expansion plans make sense. We are also in favor of the companys focus on reducing its manufacturing costs on a per unit basis while investing to maintain its technological advantage. To reduce costs, Tesla makes its own batteries, with plans to increase its own battery cell production from an annual capacity of 100 gigawatt-hours in 2022 to 3 terawatt-hours by 2030. The battery will also be incorporated into the structural design of the EV. Teslas battery improvements aim to enable a 56% reduction in the cost per kWh, a 54% range increase, and a 69% reduction in investment per GWh. We are in favor of the focus on reducing costs, as this should enable Tesla to keep its cost advantage intact as large legacy automakers electrify further this decade. Reduced manufacturing costs should enable Tesla to increase profit margins for its existing vehicles and produce an affordable sedan and SUV in the future at a profitable level. We also think management is smart to look at adding ancillary revenue streams such as selling insurance, autonomous driving software, and charging, all of which can increase total customer spending.We see shareholder distributions as appropriate. Tesla does not pay a dividend and to date has not repurchased shares. Instead, it has used the capital markets to issue stock, most recently at value-accretive levels. Given that Tesla is investing heavily in expanding its vehicle and battery production capacity, we think the best use of capital is internal reinvestment to fund organic growth rather than shareholder distribution. However, with solid free cash flow generation and little debt, management said it is considering beginning to repurchase shares. Given that Tesla is able to fully fund its growth plans through operating cash flor generation, we think share repurchases make sense with excess cash flow.Elon Musk has been Teslas CEO since 2008. Before cofounding Tesla, he cofounded and sold the internet payment system PayPal. Musk has also cofounded SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Co. Further, Musk purchased Twitter in late 2022 and is currently the CEO. For Tesla, Musks compensation comes entirely from stock awards. Under the plan created in 2018, Musk can earn up to 101.3 million stock option awards (split adjusted, at a price of $70.01 per share) in 12 tranches based on meeting revenue, EBITDA, and market capitalization targets, which Musk has largely completed. For future compensation awards, while we understand the revenue and EBITDA targets for a growing company, we would prefer a return on invested capital metric be added.Tom Zhu, Tesla's vice president of greater China, was recently appointed to also oversee the company's U.S. vehicle assembly operations as well as overseeing sales operations in the U.S. and Europe. With Zhu's expanded role, he is now the second-highest ranking executive at Tesla after CEO Elon Musk. Given's Musk's large responsibilities outside of Tesla, we think the move makes sense as Zhu can be the key decision-maker for most of Tesla's operations. Additionally, the move may set up Zhu to ultimately move into the CEO role at Tesla if Elon Musk were to retire.","Founded in 2003 and based in Palo Alto, California, Tesla is a vertically integrated sustainable energy company that also aims to transition the world to electric mobility by making electric vehicles. The company sells solar panels and solar roofs for energy generation plus batteries for stationary storage for residential and commercial properties including utilities. Tesla has multiple vehicles in its fleet, which include luxury and midsize sedans and crossover SUVs. The company also plans to begin selling more affordable sedans and small SUVs, a light truck, a semi truck, and a sports car. Global deliveries in 2022 were a little over 1.3 million vehicles.","Tesla is in excellent financial health. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments stood at $26.1 billion and exceeded total debt as of Sept. 30, 2023. Total debt was around $4.4 billion; however, total debt excluding vehicle and energy product financing (nonrecourse debt) was less than $50 million.To fund its growth plans, Tesla has historically used credit lines, convertible debt financing, and equity offerings to raise capital. In 2020, the company raised $12.3 billion in three equity issuances. We think this makes sense as funding massive growth solely through debt adds additional risk in a cyclical industry.Management has stated a preference to pay down all debt over time and has essentially achieved its goal. Regardless, with positive free cash flow generation and a clean balance sheet, we think Tesla should easily have the ability to fund its growth plans with cash from operations and have remaining free cash flow to return to shareholders through share repurchases if the company chooses to do so in the future.",TSLA,Consumer Cyclical,759221452800.0,NMS,121331709.0,USD,234.2100067138672,True,0,242.28352930406,212.17703699182343,0
24/11/2023,Maintaining Our $15 Fair Value Estimate for Huntington After First-Quarter Earnings,Huntington Bancshares Inc,HBAN,4,21/11/2023,Eric Compton,10.87,USD,23/11/2023,15.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,21/11/2023,"We will discontinue analyst coverage of Huntington Bancshares on or about Dec. 13, 2023. We provide analyst research and ratings on over 1,500 companies globally and periodically adjust our coverage according to investor interest and staffing.","A strong economy and higher rates are all positives for the banking sector and should propel revenue and profitability even higher. Recent acquisitions have improved Huntington's scale and share, and more revenue growth could be right around the corner. Huntington has taken advantage of new markets and product sets from its acquisitions, growing fee income and taking some share along the way. This could continue, potentially allowing Huntington to increase revenue faster than peers.","There are few positive catalysts left for the banks. Funding costs are running higher, net interest income has likely peaked, higher regulatory scrutiny is likely, and a recession may be around the corner. It is hard to tell when deposit flight and funding cost risks will abate. Will it require regulatory action? Will more banks fail? Will profitability be further eroded? In a more normalized credit environment, initial numbers suggest Huntington may not consistently reach its ROTCE target of 17%-plus, which raises the question of how much value the acquisition will add.",19/05/2023,"Huntington Bancshares is a midsize U.S. regional bank concentrated in the Midwest. It did not fare well in the aftermath of the financial crisis, largely because of the poorly timed acquisition of Sky Financial in 2007. Although it seemed like a reasonable combination at the time with significant footprint overlap, the potential for considerable synergies turned into massive losses due to the subprime mortgage business and bad commercial loans, which nearly broke the bank. Stephen Steinour joined as CEO in 2009, and Huntington embarked on a strategy shift in 2010 that focused on delivering strong customer service to middle-market businesses and retail clients. The bank also took steps to improve its internal credit procedures and shore up its balance sheet. This strategy has been successful. Commercial and consumer relationships have grown, Huntington has been successful at expanding relationships across multiple product lines, and overall fee income has improved. Huntington returned to the acquisition front in a big way in 2016 with the purchase of FirstMerit. This added much-needed scale and efficiency while improving market share. After cutting over 40% of FirstMerits original cost base, Huntington sold its more expansive product set in new markets. Growth in home lending in Chicago and from the RV/boat financing unit has been very strong ever since. Meanwhile, Huntington's auto financing franchise remains strong as ever. Since FirstMerit, Huntington has completed several bolt-on acquisitions, including HSE in 2018 and Capstone Partners in 2022 to help further build out its capital markets unit. Huntington also completed another sizable banking acquisition in 2021, TCF Financial, in a classic cost-saving, market-overlap play. While this acquisition may not be as transformative as the FirstMerit deal, it increased Huntington's size and market share nonetheless. Amid the current banking industry turmoil, we expect Huntington will face increased funding costs, but nothing that poses any existential risks to the bank. In fact, the overall stability of the deposit base coming out of the first quarter was encouraging to us.","We believe Huntington Bancshares has a narrow moat because it possesses cost advantages and switching costs that are consistent with our bank moat framework. Huntingtons business model is balanced between commercial and retail operations and features a unique auto financing business as well as drastically improving scale and operating efficiency after the acquisitions of FirstMerit and TCF. These items should support competitive core deposit costs, above-average operating efficiency, higher fee income levels, and pricing advantages for the auto business, all of which should enable the bank to consistently earn returns that exceed its 9% cost of equity through the cycle.We argue that bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. Cost advantages stem from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting, with regulatory costs a final factor to consider. Huntington Bancshares was hit hard during the most recent recession, with its exposure to Rust Belt economies in Ohio and Michigan, outsize exposure to the auto industry, exposure to commercial real estate, and the particularly poorly timed acquisition of Sky Financial all leading to disastrous results. With combined provisioning for 2008 and 2009 exceeding total net interest income for the same period, the bank has not historically had a credit cost advantage. However, it has done a good job of derisking its loan portfolios, setting exposure limits, and correcting many of its mistakes. Further, we believe the bank, with its ability to source superprime auto loan business at attractive rates, has a credit advantage in this segment of the business. We also believe Huntingtons embedded relationships with more than 300 fully vetted franchise auto dealers throughout its 24-state footprint, as well as its complete product set specifically designed for this market segment, also support a pricing advantage in this market. The bank seems to earn extra yield in this area compared with peers, and credit quality is generally pristine. Huntington has not had a loss on its floor-plan book for more than a decade, for example. The banks operating efficiency ratios have been pressured over the years as low interest rates pressured yields and fixing credit issues was the top priority. The bank also lacked the scale of some of its larger competitors. This has changed with the acquisition of FirstMerit, with over 40% of FirstMerits original cost base eliminated, and more recently the acquisition of TCF. We see a likely path toward solid operating efficiency for Huntington Bancshares as a whole. In addition to this extra operating scale, Huntington now has better deposit market share stats. The bank is the number-one deposit taker in four of its top nine metro areas, including Akron, Ohio, and its home of Columbus, Ohio (where it controls over 30% of all deposits). These areas account for over 70% of the banks deposits. The bank has several sources of noninterest income, including a mortgage banking group, capital markets, payment processing, wealth management, and even a small trust service unit. This has led to noninterest income making up more than 30% of revenue. We believe having these additional offerings leads to an improved breadth of products, enabling more cross-selling, higher margins, lower distribution costs, and higher switching costs.From a systemic standpoint, we believe the United States offers a fair but improving banking environment. Regulation has become considerably stronger since the crisis, and capital levels have never been higher, though the country still uses a complex and somewhat archaic system of regulation. Furthermore, the U.S. banking market remains relatively fragmented; Huntington must compete with a variety of regional and community banks as well as large money center institutions. Our outlook is positive from a macroeconomic and political standpoint. The U.S. is still the world's leading democracy, has increased GDP at a steady pace for years, and maintains the world's reserve currency, all of which contribute to banking stability.Huntington is not large enough to be considered a global systemically important bank and therefore avoids some of the more onerous regulatory capital requirements. Huntington is large enough to be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests because it has more than $100 billion in assets, but it has to go through the full process only every two years. It also avoids extra liquidity coverage and funding ratio requirements. Overall, the bank avoids much of the extra regulation that larger peers are subject to, although it is on the lower end of the size bucket for its current regulatory category. While we do think Huntington could benefit from some additional scale, it is also small enough to avoid some of the extra costs faced by its largest peers. Further requirements will be triggered if the bank surpasses $250 billion in assets.","We view the macroeconomic backdrop as the primary risk for regional banks. Huntingtons profitability will largely be determined by the interest-rate cycle as well as the effects of credit and debt cycles, none of which are under managements control.Huntington maintains relatively high exposure to the Midwest, which has a history of being harder hit during a recession. Should these markets return to economic troubles, Huntingtons loan losses could rise and earnings would suffer. Additionally, Huntington benefits from strong results in the automobile sales industry, and a significant downturn in sales could negatively affect the banks revenue growth as well as credit losses, although the bank does target superprime car buyers exclusively within its indirect auto portfolio.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, which can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare headline-grabbing scandal, we dont expect social risks to have a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors that can come under more scrutiny at times, like gun manufacturers or energy firms. Commercial banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint, and governance practices are in line with most companies.We typically assign our U.S. regional banks a Medium Uncertainty Rating, but given heightened deposit base, funding cost, and regulatory uncertainty, we have raised the Uncertainty Rating for Huntington to High.","We give Huntington a Standard capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are standard, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. Huntington is within management's targeted common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9%-10%, and we view the current goals as appropriate. We view the company's capital investments as standard. The bank invested capital poorly heading into the 2008 crisis, but it has improved since, improving risk management and credit underwriting while making several acquisitions along the way. Overall, we view the largest acquisitions the bank has made, notably FirstMerit, as value-additive, although we are not as sure that the TCF Financial acquisition will have as large of an impact on the bank's profitability profile. Over the last decade, Huntington has turned into a solid regional bank franchise with respectable operating metrics.We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. Huntington, like most banks, returns more capital through share repurchases than dividends, which makes sense for a company whose earnings can be volatile and where capital adequacy is paramount. CEO Stephen Steinour has been at the helm since 2009 and previously spent more than a decade with Citizens Financial Group. He came in after the crisis and helped turn around a bank that was at the brink of considering seeking a buyer and no longer remaining independent. Under his leadership, the bank significantly improved its credit underwriting practices, refocused the business model, and quickly returned to generating healthy returns. We applaud management for these efforts over the years. We like that Steinour has allocated these profits in a controlled and diversified manner across dividend increases, share buybacks, and disciplined acquisitions that have been well integrated. We think the banks purchase of 24 branches in Michigan from Bank of America in 2014 is one example of an acquisition that made strategic sense, giving a sensible extension to both the banks auto industry focus and its Midwest footprint. We also believe the FirstMerit acquisition has been particularly transformative, providing additional scale, share, and growth opportunities, and has strengthened the banks moat. The bank's efforts to expand capital markets capabilities also appear to be paying dividends. We like the additional, focused acquisitions the bank has done in capital markets and equipment finance, such as with HSE and Capstone Partners.Regarding the TCF Financial acquisition, while we think there were a lot of strategic and cost overlaps, we're not as convinced that it will have as much of an impact on the bank's profitability profile. ","Huntington Bancshares is a regional bank holding company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The bank has a network of branches and ATMs across eight Midwestern states. Founded in 1866, Huntington National Bank and its affiliates provide consumer, small-business, commercial, treasury management, wealth management, brokerage, trust, and insurance services. Huntington also provides auto dealer, equipment finance, national settlement, and capital market services that extend beyond its core states.","We believe Huntington remains in solid financial health. While capital adequacy has been an area of increased debate recently, we do not have concerns about capital for Huntington. The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.5% as of the first quarter, in line with management's target. While there is some uncertainty around future regulatory changes, we would expect the bank to have a CET 1 ratio, even including accumulated other comprehensive income, that exceeds its 7.8% minimum as soon as the second quarter of 2023. Further, we would expect any material regulatory changes to be gradually phased in, with nothing material likely be required until the end of 2024 at the earliest. We expect the bank's dividend payout ratio will creep up into the mid-50s for several quarters as funding pressure increases. While this is higher than normal, the bank can still easily cover its dividend while also building capital. We expect dividend hikes and share buybacks to be limited for the next year or two as the bank prepares for any potential regulatory changes.",HBAN,Financial Services,17000459264.0,NMS,21443047.0,USD,10.869999885559082,True,1,10.731999958261177,12.643086398090123,1
25/11/2023,Relaunching Telia Coverage; FVE of SEK 29; Downgrade to Poor Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating,Telia Company AB,TELIA,4,19/10/2023,Javier Correonero,24.68,SEK,24/11/2023,29.0,Medium,Narrow,Poor,C,19/10/2023,"Shares of narrow-moat Telia are up 9% at the time of the writing due to a strong EBITDA development in the third quarter and a slight increase in 2023 guidance. Service revenue grew by 2.6% organically, which translated into 7.6% organic growth in EBITDA thanks to operating leverage and lower energy expenses. All geographies contributed to EBITDA growth and the standouts Finland, Norway, and the Baltics had double-digit growth. Price increases coupled with lower energy expenses were the main drivers of profit growth. In Sweden, which represents 40% of the groups revenue, EBITDA grew by 4% due to service revenue growth of 2.2% and mix improvements. We maintain our SEK 29 fair value estimate, with shares trading at around SEK 26 after the 9% increase. The increase in 2023 guidance was modest, from ""flat- to low-single-digit growth"" in EBITDA to ""low-single-digit growth."" We anticipate a strong fourth quarter given easy comparable figures and healthy developments recently. However, we dont anticipate Telia's performance this quarter will extend into the long term given the competitive nature of telecommunications markets. Telias net debt/EBITDA ratio went back to 2.5 times (guided range of 2.0 to 2.5 times) and it is expected to decrease by around 0.2 times after the divestment of Telia Denmark. Telias TV and media division (10% of revenue) continues to lag with an 8.6% decline in revenue and big shifts in quarterly EBITDA.","Telia is very strong in Sweden and Norway, where it has high market share. These regions represent around 60% of profits and revenue. Management has reduced business complexity in recent years, getting out of most Eurasian operations. We expect the Baltics will keep growing at high- to mid-single-digits, acting as a growth engine for Telia ","Telia is a poor capital allocator. It has extended its operations too much and its balance sheet is weak, with relatively high leverage and exposure to interest-rate changes. Telias current dividend is not covered by free cash flow generation. There is risk of a dividend cut in the medium term. The acquisition of Bonnier Broadcasting in 2018 was done at a high multiple, especially considering it is a business in structural decline.",15/02/2023,"During the early 2000s Telia overextended its operations, owning majority or minority  stakes in telecommunication companies in places like Nepal, Turkey, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Georgia, among many others. We believe Telias management realized the lack of competitive advantages far away from home and began to shrink its operations, divesting most of these businesses in the past five years. Although now Telia remains focused on the Nordics and Baltics, it is still present in seven countries, something we believe creates inefficiencies. Telecom operators that remain narrow and focused on their home markets tend to performer better. Telias strategic decisions have therefore been mixed. Some good decisions include acquiring Tele2s Norwegian mobile business in 2014 and cable operator Get in 2018, as it now enjoys very high margins and market share in this geography. Divesting all the Eurasian operations was also positive in our view. On the contrary, acquiring media group Bonnier Broadcasting in 2018 was a bad decision, as linear TV is in structural decline. Telia is Swedens most expensive telecom provider, with prices being 15% to 30% higher than peers in mobile and broadband. It executes annual price increases, which peers like Tele2 also follow, although at a softer pace, so we dont expect this gap to be closed any time soon. We believe Swedish operators are in favor of market stability as highlighted by stable prices for many years, a dynamic we also see in Norway and Finland. In the Baltics, Telia is the number-one player in Latvia and second-largest in Lithuania. For the past decade, sales in the Baltics have been growing at double-digit rates, with price increases being the main growth driver, giving consumers more for more. Baltic countries have relatively high gross domestic product per capita, but still have cheap mobile prices compared with other European countries, so we believe these markets can keep growing at mid-single-digit rates in future. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are all three-player markets, which normally favor stability and growth. ","We give Telia a narrow moat due to its competitively advantaged position in Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the Baltics supported by efficient scale. Telia is the incumbent in Sweden where it has a strategy of being the highest-priced provider, executing annual price increases. It also enjoys strong competitive positions in Norway, Finland, and some Baltic countries, acquired through the early establishment in these markets and acquisitions.In general, mobile and fixed-line telecom services in developed countries are commodity products with little differentiation, so it is unlikely that new entrants will be willing to deal with the massive upfront investments and regulatory requirements required to join a commoditized market. Developed telecom markets are mature markets with almost zero growth, which also keeps new entrants at the bay, as the profit pool is stable or declining. New entrants also know incumbents have high barriers to exit (network access is considered an essential service in many countries) so even if they are able to disrupt the market for some time, they know competitors will not easily leave. Old national champions usually have advantageous positions compared with alternative operators as they already have extensive infrastructure in place and have long-standing relationships with governments.Although fixed and wireless markets present moaty characteristics, we believe the moat source is stronger in fixed networks. Also, it is important to realize that both types of networks are interconnected. One of the main features of wireless networks is that they require spectrum to be operated, a unique and scarce resource that is granted periodically and for which bidders need to meet certain requirements. Mobile Network Operators, which own spectrum, can serve their mobile customers directly or can also rent out their networks to other competitors (mobile virtual network operators). Mobile networks rely on spectrum, towers, antennas, and other equipment to operate, but they also need a backbone of fixed infrastructure. If an operator does not own the fixed infrastructure it will have to rent it from another competitor. In addition, fixed infrastructure is not only used to support mobile communication, but also its own for broadband internet. We believe the efficient scale moat source is stronger in fixed-line networks as developing underground channels for cables is more costly and complicated, as new lines may affect entire neighborhoods, traffic flows, or coincide with other underground infrastructure, so the rationale for duplicating capacities is low.We believe the characteristics of Nordic countries like Sweden, Norway, or Finland also contribute to market stability. The area of these countries is larger than that of Germany or Italy but with a population that is six to eight times less. The complicated geography and weather conditions, especially in the far north, make it more challenging to deploy networks, so it is more complicated to win the necessary market share and scale to compete effectively, something that we believe reduces its market attractiveness, preventing the entrance of new players and helping to maintain stability.Sweden has four mobile network operators: Telia (incumbent), Tele2, Telenor, and Three. Telia has always been the leader (with slightly more than 30% market share compared with Tele2's slightly less than 30%) thanks to establishing itself early in the market as the incumbent. While markets with four mobile operators are less supportive of moats, Swedish players seem to understand that price stability is needed to support acceptable returns on capital, as highlighted by stable average-revenue-per-user trends for many years. The small presence of MVNOs and resellers, which have less than 5% market share, also promotes price stability in the Swedish market. Telias strategy is to be the highest priced in the market where it has high market share, executing annual prices increases, something that will encourage stability. Tele2 follows Telia price increases, though with a smoother and softer approach.In the fixed-line market, Sweden counts several networks: 1) Telias DSL network, which is gradually being converted from copper to fiber (fiber-to-the-building is the most common technology) 2) Tele2s hybrid fiber coaxial network, which is mainly focused on urban areas and 3) more than 100 small regional fiber networks, which belong to municipalities, usually in areas where Telia has not deployed fiber. These municipal networks operate as wholesale-only networks where service providers rent the lines. Market share and network ownership can vary wildly by municipality (Sweden has 290 municipalities). Telia, as the incumbent, is the owner of Swedens farthest-reaching fixed-line network and has the highest broadband market share at around 29%. Sweden has developed the wholesale network model properly. When an operator like Telia lays a cable to a new building, it passes the upfront costs to the households by charging them an amount between EUR 1,000 and EUR 3,000, and then gives wholesale access to other service providers to that household. Although this means some customers wont remain captive to Telias service and will switch to other providers, it also reduces the business capital intensity. Some service providers might only be available in certain geographical areas. Since 2016, Telia has lost around 600 basis points in broadband market share (from 35% to 29%), but we believe it will remain the market leader given its incumbent position, good network, and established brand. The firm is also the only available network or provider in some areas. In Nordic countries like Germany, telecom operators work with housing associations to become the exclusive network providers in certain areas. In Norway, we believe Telia has played its cards well. In 2014 it acquired the mobile operations of Tele2 in Norway, a transaction that almost doubled its size, moving Telia from around 20% market share to 35% and converting the mobile market into a de facto duopoly (Telenor and Telia control more than 90% of the mobile market). Since then Telia has even managed to slightly grow its market share while increasing prices steadily, in line with Telenor. In 2018 Telia continued its mergers and acquisitions, acquiring Get, the Norwegian cable provider. Although Gets cable network only passes 30% of Norwegian homes, it is focused in key urban areas like Oslo and Bergen where the company has a very high penetration rate of 60%, which is reflected in strong EBITDA (before leases) margins of around 45% in this geography. We believe Telia enjoys a competitively advantaged position in Norway thanks to the duopoly in the mobile market and its strong cable operations. In Finland, Elisa Oyj is the mobile market leader with more than 40% market share, followed by Telenor and Telia with slightly less than 30% each. We believe the Finnish market is supportive of competitive advantages given its three-player structure with steadily increasing mobile prices and a light regulatory environment. Finlands telecom market cannot be analyzed under the same lens as other markets, as here the relevance of fixed-line networks is less. Network investment has traditionally been focused on mobile rather than fixed-line networks, and today Finland has one of the most developed and dense mobile networks in the world, which in many cases acts as a substitute for broadband networks. According to the regulator Traficom, 60% of Finnish consumers are not interested in upgrading their broadband speeds at home, something we believe shows the quality of the mobile network. Elisa implemented a billing system that is different from other countries, where operators provide unlimited data allowances, but charge for incremental speed, rather than the traditional method of charging for more data allowance. Other operators like Telia followed this approach.In Denmark Telia lacks the necessary scale to achieve superior returns, being half the size of the incumbent TDC with significantly inferior margins. In 2015 Telia and Telenor tried to merge their Danish operations to achieve the necessary scale for better returns, but the deal was blocked by the European Union. In the Baltics Telia is present in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, having a similar positioning to Tele2. While Tele2 is the largest player in Lithuania, Telia is the largest in Latvia, and Elisa Oyj is the largest in Estonia. Although we normally require ownership of fixed-line networks to grant moats to European telecommunication companies given they are more difficult to replicate, the market structure in the Baltics is different. Penetration and usage of fixed-line networks in these countries are way lower than in Western Europe given the late development, and many users rely on wireless services not only for their smartphones, but also for the internet at home. We believe Telias high market share and maintained EBITDA margins of around 35%-40% reflect its scale in these countries. This, together with a three-player market structure in every market, reflects a narrow moat in this division. ","We give Telia a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Telias main risk is that its dividend is not covered by free cash flow generation. Telias recent dividends have been partially financed by debt, and we believe there is a risk of dividend cuts if financial performance deteriorates in any country. The margin of error is small. Telia also carries interest-rate risk, with almost 70% of its debt instruments carrying variable rates.Despite having four mobile operators, Swedens competitive environment has remained stable for many years. Telia and Tele2 compete in the higher-end of the market while Telenor and HiG3 are more focused on value customers. In Norway, Telenor and Telia have 90% market share in the mobile market, while Finland remains a stable, three-player market with slight price growth. All these countries have few MVNOs and resellers, which favors market stability.In the Baltics Telia also enjoys a comfortable position, being exposed to three markets (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) with only three mobile operators each. Most Baltic operators are Nordic companies (Telia, Tele2, and Elisa), so we believe they understand the rules of telecom markets well, where price wars are a lose-lose scenario for everyone. Telias main environmental, social, and governance risk is that telecommunication services are often considered public goods, which can lead regulators to scrutinize a firms network quality and pricing for maximum customer welfare. Regulators are also generally concerned about concentrated market share, so they may introduce measures to curb market power or encourage competition that can harm incumbents. Regulators also often block mergers or acquisitions, which can increase competition or limit a companys reinvestment or divestment opportunities.","We give Telia a Poor Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating.For many years, Telia overextended its operations, owning majority or minority stakes in telecommunication companies in places like Nepal, Turkey, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, or Georgia. Telia even owned a debt collection business until 2017, when it sold it for SEK 1.2 billion in 2017. Around 2015 management realized there was no point in operating so far away from home and began to divest most of these businesses. We believe Telias adventures out of home have destroyed value for shareholders. In 2018 Telia acquired Bonnier Broadcasting, a Swedish media company, at an enterprise value of 8.4 times EBITA. We believe this was a bad capital allocation decision, as this sector is in structural decline and Bonnier has been a poor performer since then.However, we support some of the expansion decisions Telia has taken in the past decade. Entering Norway by acquiring the Tele2 mobile business in 2014 and the Get cable network in 2018 was a good move. Telenor and Telia hold 90% of mobile market share in Norway, while Get is a local operator with very high margins and broadband penetration rates.On the balance sheet front, we believe Telias stewardship has also been poor. Net debt/EBITDA is expected to reach 2.5 times by 2023, the higher limit of managements guided range. We see no room for organic debt reductions if it wants to maintain its dividend, so leverage can only be reduced by cutting the dividend or divesting businesses or assets. Telia also carries interest-rate risk, with almost 70% of its debt instruments carrying variable rates. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate of debt increases Telias interest payments by almost SEK 500 million.We believe a dividend cut is feasible in the medium term, as Telias dividend is not covered by free cash flow generation and has been partially financed by debt during recent years. We believe it is likely that Telia will have to either: 1) increase its leverage above 2.5 times net debt/EBITDA (its guided range), or 2) cut its dividend. Any of these measures would be detrimental to shareholders. ","Telia is the incumbent telecommunications operator in Sweden but is also present in Norway, Finland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries. In the past five years, Telia has been narrowing its business focus, divesting businesses in Asia and focusing on its core markets. In 2022 Telia had revenue of more than SEK 90 billion, with the majority of it coming from the Nordic markets. ","As of December 2022, Telia had a net debt/EBITDA ratio (after leases) of 2.3 times, slightly higher than other European peers. This ratio is expected to grow closer to 2.5 times in 2023. Telia has almost no room for organic debt reductions if it wants to maintain its dividend, so leverage can only be reduced by cutting the dividend or divesting businesses or assets. Telia also carries interest-rate risk, with almost 70% of its debt instruments carrying variable rates.

24/11/2023,Smartphone Demand Rebound Is a Plus but Cautious on MLCC Price Erosion,Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd,6981,4,07/11/2023,Kazunori Ito,2924.5,JPY,24/11/2023,3300.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,C,07/11/2023,"One of the few positive factors for the earnings of the three passive component suppliers was the solid demand for flagship smartphones such as the iPhone, and the recovery of component demand from Chinese smartphone manufacturers as they completed the inventory adjustments. On the other hand, demand for PCs and servers remained weak, and the stagnation in sales for industrials is expected to continue. As a result, the impact on each companys business was slightly different due to their business portfolios. Murata Manufacturing, which is more exposed to the smartphone industry, has revised its operating income guidance to JPY 270 billion from JPY 220 billion, while TDK has maintained it at JPY 150 billion, and Kyocera has lowered it to JPY 120 billion from JPY 147 billion. While demand for electronic components has bottomed out and is expected to gradually improve, we are cautious that suppliers tend to offer aggressive component pricing during the recovery phase to attract more orders. We believe Muratas shares are undervalued, while TDKs and Kyoceras shares are fairly valued. Muratas September-quarter operating income was JPY 88.9 billion, exceeding our expectation of JPY 80 billion. Although inventory adjustment weighed on profitability, operating margin for the quarter improved significantly to 20.1% from 13.6% in the June quarter. This was largely due to the recovery of the devices and modules segment from around breakeven to 13.6%, driven by the high seasonality of iPhone demand and improved product mix due to the recovery of RF filter sales from Chinese smartphone manufacturers. The company raised its full-year operating income guidance to JPY 270 billion from JPY 220 billion, which is in line with our forecast, based on upbeat first-half results and changes in currency exchange assumptions. Our new fair value estimate is set at JPY 3,300, reflecting the impact of the 1-to-3 stock split implemented in early October.","Murata will benefit from increasing passive components demand per phone, as a result of advancing technology in telecommunications. In particular, diffusion of LTE and LTE-advanced networks will be the driver. LTE-advanced networks require module structures, and Murata may expand its share especially in Chinese smartphones, benefiting from its cost advantage of collecting all key components for RF solutions. While shipment of smartphones and tablets may remain flat, other devices will be connected to the internet, and Murata will remain one of the key players in the telecom industry.","The average pricing of smartphones has been gradually decreasing since 2012 and the profitability of handset makers is declining as a result. Consequently, the price-cut pressure for components will strengthen. The shipment of smartphones and tablets remains flat, so demand for RF components will slowdown. Muratas module business will be exposed to intense competition with power amplifier manufacturers such as Skyworks, Avago, and Quovo, and will be unable to obtain sufficient market share to generate enough profitability.",07/11/2023,"Murata Manufacturing is a top supplier of passive components, such as the multilayer ceramic capacitor, or MLCC (40% global share), and surface acoustic wave, or SAW, filters (40%-45% global share). While we acknowledge that shipments of digital devices are slowing down, we believe progress in telecommunications technology will be the driver to increase content per device. Passive components are necessary for all electronic circuits. They are used to store electricity, to control electric flow, to enable wireless communication, and to remove electromagnetic noise. While we acknowledge that shipments of digital appliances are slowing down, we think progress in telecommunication standardssuch as 3G, LTE, LTE advanced, and 5Gand increased electronic devices in automobiles will drive the continued expansion of the component market. Handset manufacturers need to enable both faster communication speed and longer battery life, and while increasing the communication speed requires more passive components, larger rechargeable batteries and thinner housing force circuit boards to become even smaller, which eventually makes the boards extremely crowded. We think Muratas expertise in manufacturing smaller components will help maintain its market position and stabilize its profitability. In the longer term, we identify another growth opportunity in the automotive industry. Various regulations for safety and environment require automobiles to adopt more electronic devices and controlling units; thus, the growth of passive components per car is exceeding the auto production. Murata Manufacturings market share of auto MLCCs is approximately 50%, and revenue from auto is 19% of entire sales.","We assign a narrow economic moat rating to Murata Manufacturing, based on intangible assets for passive components, especially for handsets. Muratas market share and operating margins on major products, such as MLCC and SAW filters, are at least double those of competitors. The combination of processors and passive components is important for enabling better speed and quality in telecommunication, and as Murata has been the top player in passive components for more than 20 years, the company works closely with major chipmakers in the industrybaseband processor manufacturers such as Qualcomm and MediaTek, and power amplifier manufacturers such as Skyworks, Avago, and Quovo. This close relationship helps chipmakers design a better telecommunication circuit, and benefits Murata by securing its position, especially for its SAW filter business. In addition, although the cost of passive components is cheaper than that of other devices (such as displays, DRAMs, and processors), the quality of passive components is crucial for telecommunication. Therefore, we see no incentive for handset makers or device makers to switch from Murata to other vendors to save a little money.We also believe Muratas expertise in ceramics is an important factor constituting an economic moat, providing both an intangible benefit and leading to a current cost advantage. Murata was one of the first companies to apply ceramics to passive components (in the 1940s-50s). The company has integrated the material manufacturing process internally, and holds various patents about materials for ceramic capacitors. The advantage on materials not only leads to a higher operating margin for Murata, but also works as a strong entry barrier, because Murata is leading the industry to produce smaller components with larger capacity. Enabling longer battery life is a crucial factor for devices, such as smartphones and wearable devices. While devices become thinner and smaller, handset makers need to secure enough space for rechargeable batteries. In fact, battery capacity has been gradually increasing in recent times. As a result, smartphone circuit boards are becoming smaller and smaller, and consequently more crowded. Therefore, smaller size and larger capacity are required qualities for electronic components. In 2000, 1608 size (1.6mm x 0.8mm x 0.8mm) had the largest share in the MLCC market. A flagship product moved to 1005 size (1.0mm x 0.5mm x 0.5mm) around 2010, and moved to 0603 size (0.6mm x 0.3mm x 0.3mm) in 2016. In addition, 0402 (0.4mm x 0.2mm x 0.2mm) and 0201 (0.25mm x 0.125mm x 0.125mm) sizes are already in mass production, and we expect the proportion of smaller components will increase in the near future. We believe this trend of miniaturization would be an entry barrier against new entrants. For instance, while there are many manufacturers of MLCCs, we estimate that only three companies (Murata, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, and Taiyo Yuden) have enough capacity to produce 0402 size, and only two companies (Murata and Taiyo Yuden) are currently able to mass-produce 0201 size. Muratas advantage in manufacturing better products in smaller sizes enables premium pricing on its components. Therefore, we regard this advantage as a source of an economic moat, and believe Murata could generate maintainable excess returns on capital as a result. While we expect robust growth for passive components, which is driven by evolving telecommunications technology, we believe Murata will maintain its position as a top supplier of key components, such as MLCC and SAW filters, on which Murata achieves high profitability.In fiscal 2022, approximately 44% of Muratas sales were MLCCs, 4% were piezoelectric components including SAW filters, 10% were other passive components, and 20% were modules. Murata is achieving high profitability on the components business (MLCCs, SAW filters, and other passive components), compared with that on the modules business (30.6% margin for components versus 2.7% for modules in fiscal 2022), and we believe Muratas strength in components will deliver maintainable excess returns on capital. MLCCs store electricity and stabilize electric flow, and are used to remove electromagnetic noise from the electronic circuits. Thus, MLCCs are indispensable to electronic circuits and used on various applications. The largest demand for MLCCs comes from handsets, and as there is limited area on circuit boards, smaller size with higher capacity is required. Murata Manufacturing is the top supplier of MLCCs, with around 40% of global share in 2020. We estimate that the second supplier is Samsung Electro-Mechanics (18% market share), while the third is Taiyo Yuden (12% market share) and the fourth is TDK (8% market share). While we assume the midterm operating margin of other companies is around the 20%-25% level, the operating margin of Murata is above 40%. Surface Acoustic Wave, or SAW, filters, which extract only the required portion of radio signal, constitute the key device in wireless communication circuits. We assume the top three suppliers of SAW filters are Murata (45% market share in 2021), TDK (15%-20% market share), and Taiyo Yuden (15% market share). Power Amplifier manufacturers, such as Skyworks, Avago, and Qorvo, possess limited internal sources of filters, and therefore purchase majority of SAW filters from these three suppliers. We assume Muratas midterm operating margin on the SAW filter is approximately 25%-30%, while that of other two companies are about 10%. Currently, 85% of global filters demand is covered by the SAW filter, and 15% is covered by Bulk Acoustic Wave, or BAW, filters. While the SAW filter has a cost advantage against the BAW filter, the BAW filter is regarded as more appropriate for capturing higher frequency bands (above 2GHz) than SAW filters. Recently, however, as a result of improvements, Murata has successfully expanded the coverage of the SAW filter up to 2.5GHz. We expect more demand on filters covering higher frequency bands, such as 2-2.5GHz, in future, as a result of introducing Carrier Aggregation technology, and we believe SAW filters will benefit from this demand, as SAW filters retain their cost advantage.Muratas other passive components, which help remove noise from electronic circuits, have advantages in achieving sufficient quality at a smaller size. For instance, we assume Murata has 35% market share on EMI filters and 40% market share on chip coils for handsets. The larger part of the module business is Wi-Fi modules for handsets, which has 60% market share, but as Murata needs to purchase chips from Broadcom, profitability is lower than that of passive components. Murata purchased a power amplifier business from Renesas in 2012, in order to expand its radio frequency module business. However, we do not expect strong revenue contribution on this area, as existing players Skyworks, Avago, and Qorvo are quite competitive. Power amplifier manufacturers are clients of Muratas component business, but are competitors on the module business.","We have assigned Murata Manufacturing a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. While smartphone demand remains bumpy, demand for high-end components from autos, servers, and high-end smartphones contributes to mitigating the cyclicality and maintaining high blended average pricing.As a net exporter from Japan, Murata Manufacturing is vulnerable to movements in foreign-exchange rates. In order to protect production know-how, approximately 60% of Muratas production line is located in Japan. As a consequence, Muratas profitability is affected by changes in the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Muratas return on invested capital was low from fiscal 2009 (financial year ending March 2009) to fiscal 2013. We understand this was caused not only by the foreign-exchange rate, but also by the poor product mix. However, we believe Muratas product portfolio has improved significantly. Previously, diffusion of digital devices such as PCs, TVs, and digital cameras was the driver of Muratas revenue, but auto digitalization and adoption of new telecommunication technologies will be the biggest drivers of Muratas revenue in future. We therefore believe Murata will maintain its competitive edge in this environment. We do not think Murata faces any material, company-specific risks, which may have an impact on our economic moat rating and Uncertainty Rating. The company pays particular attention to emission and energy consumption as the production of passive components consumes a large amount of electricity. Despite its increasing revenue over the past few years, the company has been managing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption very well, based on disclosed numbers. Over the past decade, the company has not incurred any losses associated with environmental, social, and governance issues.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Murata Manufacturing is Standard.Muratas mainstay product, multilayer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs, require heavy investment due to the process of stacking hundreds to thousands of layers of ceramic sheets and sintering them at temperatures of 1,000 degrees or higher. In fact, driven by robust MLCC demand, Murata invested 17% of revenue on average for capital expenditure over the past five years. That said, MLCC suppliers must find a good balance between heavy capital expenditure, strategic acquisition, shareholders' return, and financial health. From this point of view, we believe Muratas capital allocation is reasonable.Murata has a strong interest in acquiring key RF technologies through M&As. For instance, Murata purchased Renesas power amplifier business in 2012, Peregrines RF switch business in 2014, and Primatecs materials technology in 2016, and all of these acquisitions have helped Murata establish itself as one of the top players in the RF module business, in our view.Although Murata needs to invest aggressively to meet the requirements of the rapidly changing RF technology, the company recently added the target to constantly achieve 4% dividend on equity, or DOE, in addition to the traditional target of a 30% dividend payout ratio, so Murata can maintain its dividends in the downturn. We believe the company intends to deliver stable dividends amid economic fluctuations, which should be favorable for shareholders.","Murata Manufacturing produces passive components for electronic devices. Passive components are necessary for all electronic circuits, used to enable wireless communication, store electricity and handle electric flow, remove electromagnetic noise from circuits, and so on. Thus, passive components are imperative for electronic circuits. For instance, one high-end smartphone contains more than 1,000 passive components. Murata Manufacturing is the global top passive components supplier with 40% market share on MLCC and SAW filters.","Muratas capital structure is composed of equity, with net cash of JPY 3,242 billion. Considering the high cyclicality of the industry and nature of the passive components business, which requires heavy capital expenditure, tech companies tend to keep certain amounts of cash as a safety margin. In addition, Murata aims to maintain a high new-products ratio, and therefore spends 7%-8% of revenue as research and development expense each year, in order to retain its technological advantage. Therefore, even though we expect Murata could earn a high level of free cash flow in the near future, its dividend payout ratio would remain around 30%. We are comfortable with this figure, as Murata needs to strike a good balance between financial safety, future growth including its merger and acquisition strategy, and shareholder return.",6981.T,Technology,5401337135104.0,JPX,4721300.0,JPY,2924.5,True,1,2735.5426829268295,2939.6645569620255,0
24/11/2023,Weaker 2024 Guidance Leads Us to Moderate Our Near-Term Expectations for Deere,Deere & Co,DE,3,22/11/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,370.76,USD,23/11/2023,360.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,B,22/11/2023,"The key takeaway from earnings was managements weaker 2024 guidance. The company called out moderating commodity prices and higher interest rates as key drivers to weakening ag fundamentals. That said, management continues to point to the replacement cycle as a near-term driver. However, this isnt enough to drive sales and margin growth in 2024. As a result, weve lowered our 2024 sales and margin estimates. We now expect equipment sales to decline by 12%, while operating margins decrease over 300 basis points to 19.7%. These changes led to a 5% decrease in our fair value estimate, which now sits at $360 per share (from $379 previously). Deere shared similar sentiment to its peers regarding the South American ag market. The region has continued to weaken, as declining crop prices and high interest rates have slowed demand for ag equipment in the region. That said, ag fundamentals in North America remain constructive, largely due to resilient demand for cash crops. Key data points like the stocks-to-use ratio are still below previous cycle peaks. Corn stockpiles are higher than the past few years but have yet to reach peaks. Soybean supplies remain relatively low to previous cycles, which we think may lead to stable soybean prices in the near term. We view Deeres shares as slightly overvalued. The companys stock has experienced downward pressure over the past handful of months as investors have grappled with the question of moderating ag demand. Deeres fourth-quarter earnings print confirmed those concerns. However, we think its important to note that Deere can still benefit from the replacement cycle. Management highlighted during the earnings call that inventories in some product categories remain below previous cycle peaks and that fleet ages are still relatively high. We believe this shows theres some protection from a protracted downturn. Nonetheless, wed like to see a greater margin of safety in shares before getting excited about valuation. ","Higher crop prices encourage farmers to grow more crops and will lead to more farming equipment purchases, substantially boosting Deere's revenue growth. Deere will benefit from strong replacement demand, as uncertainty around trade, weather, and agriculture commodity demand has eased, encouraging farmers to refresh their machine fleet. Increased infrastructure spending in the U.S. and emerging markets will lead to more construction equipment purchases, benefiting Deere.","China could pull back on agriculture imports, weakening global demand for crops. The fallout would lead to lower crop prices, largely due to higher supply, pushing farmers to delay equipment purchases. Trade tensions between developed economies could escalate to punitive tariffs on agricultural commodity imports, reducing the demand for farmers crops in certain countries. Deere faces stiff competition from global competitors across end markets. Growing competition could pressure Deere's market share.",22/11/2023,"Deere offers customers an extensive portfolio of agriculture and construction products. We think it will continue to be the leader in the agriculture industry and one of the top players in construction. For over a century, the company has been the pre-eminent manufacturer of mission-critical agricultural equipment, which has led to its place as one of the worlds most valuable brands. Deeres strong brand is underpinned by its high-quality, extremely durable, and efficient products. Customers in developed markets also value Deeres ability to reduce the total cost of ownership.  The companys strategy focuses on delivering a comprehensive solution for farmers. Deeres innovative products target each phase of the production process, which includes field preparation, planting and seeding, applying chemicals, and harvesting. The company also embeds technology in its products, from guidance systems to seed placement and customized spraying applications. Over the past decade, the company has continually released new products and upgraded existing product models to drive greater machine efficiency. Customers also rely on the services that Deere and its dealers provide, for example, machine maintenance and access to its proprietary aftermarket parts. Furthermore, its digital applications help customers interact with dealers, manage their fleet, and track machine performance to determine when maintenance is needed.  Deere has exposure to end markets with attractive tailwinds. In agriculture, we think demand for corn and soybeans will be strong in the near term, largely due to robust demand from China and tight global supplies. On the construction side, we believe the company will benefit from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal in the U.S. The countrys roads are in poor condition, which has led to pent-up road construction demand. Looking further out, we believe precision ag will be an incremental value driver for Deere. The company recently closed the precision ag loop (in terms of capabilities) with the introduction of its autonomous 8R tractor. We estimate precision ag presents an over-$7 billion sales opportunity for the ag leader this decade.","We assign Deere a wide economic moat rating, underpinned by intangible assets and switching costs. Deere has built one of the worlds most recognizable brands, which has led to strong brand loyalty among farmers. The company has consistently provided customers with reliable, high-quality products, while working to reduce the total cost of ownership. These factors have led to Deere becoming one of the worlds most valuable brands. The strength of its brand and extensive dealer network has solidified Deere as the market leader for agricultural equipment. Deere delivers world-class products, in addition to value-added services to customers through its global dealer network. We believe smaller local and regional competitors will struggle to win market share in agriculture and construction end markets globally, allowing Deere to maintain its strong market share positions.Deeres intense brand loyalty among farmers and strong competitive positioning leads to pricing power. For decades, the company has consistently produced best-in-class agricultural equipment, leading to the largest installed base in the industry. Deere has been at the forefront of innovation in farming, mechanizing crop production, allowing farmers to do more with less. Today, the companys equipment can help farmers save on operation costs (use less fuel, chemicals, and labor), while also increasing crop yields (without having to materially increase farm acreage). Farmers value premium products (high specifications and features) that can withstand high utilization and operate outside of daylight hours. We believe Deere benefits from pricing power, manifested from its brand familiarity of more than a century and ability to continually provide innovative products. Notably, the companys large agricultural equipment command premium pricing due to the value added from its product features and technological capabilities (boosts farmer productivity). Customers come to Deere not only for the best products in the industry, but also for its ability to provide aftermarket parts on-demand and services to keep their machines running, reducing machine down-time.Additionally, the company has been committed to improving machine efficiency. Deeres precision agriculture solutions aid farmers in field preparation, planting, chemical spraying, and harvesting. Tillage equipment used in field preparation can utilize guidance systems to reduce overlap in each machine pass, collect data on field conditions (satellite mapping), and be flexible enough to adjust depth and down pressure maneuvers. In planting, Deeres machines can precisely place and space seeds in the field, all while moving up to 10 miles per hour faster than previous models (without losing accuracy). Farmers can also apply chemicals (herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides) to weeds through customized spray solutions (machines can control individual nozzles to dispense a spray). When plants are ready to be picked, Deeres products can harvest more capacity, without reducing crop quality or losing crops, in addition to saving on fuel costs. We believe Deeres superior product performance supports the firms brand equity and pricing power.Deeres products help farmers save on farming input costs, limit machine maintenance and repair costs, ultimately leading to a lower total cost of ownership. We believe this dynamic exists for a few reasons. First, the companys focus on improving machine efficiency through product innovation has boosted productivity for farmers through the reduction in input costs (less chemicals, fuel, and labor needed to produce crops compared with years past). Deeres precision solutions allow farmers to become more informed on whats driving higher crop yield, from optimal seed placement to targeted chemical spraying. Second, the companys higher-margin aftermarket business provides farmers priority on proprietary parts and services through its extensive dealer network, limiting service intervals and machine down-time. Additionally, machine connectivity helps both customers and dealers track data (machine utilization rates and productivity) to inform future service needs, allowing farmers to plan maintenance versus having to service machinery when they fail (can be disruptive in farming given finite windows to carry out farming operations).The total cost of ownership is a focus for customers in developed markets, who look for machines that help minimize on future costs (labor, maintenance and repair, spare parts, fuel, and insurance costs) and are not necessarily looking for the cheapest up-front equipment (primarily a focus for customers in developing markets). Cheaper equipment can increase the likelihood of machine failure during operation, leading to lost productivity that cuts into an operators profitability (mission-critical equipment). Fuel consumption costs are another lever that operators can focus on to drive down total ownership costs. Deere offers a wide range of products that enhance fuel efficiency, specifically through its electric drivetrain offerings. These products also help the company address carbon emissions concerns; which is increasingly becoming a point of focus for regulators. We think Deeres risk to increased emissions regulation is moderate given its continued focus on producing next-generation products that reduce machine emissions.We believe Deere is a leader in the agriculture industry when it comes to helping customers reduce the total cost of ownership. Its products employ better efficiency and output for farmers compared with competitors, allowing them to spread costs over the lifetime of equipment (operating leverage as crop yields increase). We believe this dynamic supports its brand value in the eyes of customers looking to optimize their operations.We also think Deeres construction business is strong, thanks to its Wirtgen acquisition in 2017. Prior to the acquisition, the companys product portfolio was focused on earthmoving equipment, such as, bulldozers, graders, wheel loaders, and excavators. That quickly changed as Wirtgen expanded the product portfolio to include both road construction (milling, paving, and compacting) and mineral equipment (surface miners, crushers, and asphalt plants). Today, the move has taken Deeres construction business from being a top 10 global player to a top three player behind Caterpillar and Komatsu. Customers value Wirtgens premium brands given its ability to consistently deliver strong product performance. We believe this has led to the construction business developing pricing power. The segments profitability has improved since the acquisition, showing the near term looks bright. Additionally, we think Wirtgens strong position in the road construction business globally gives Deere access to new customers in emerging markets.Deeres extensive dealer network distributes products and provides access to proprietary aftermarket parts and services across multiple geographies. The breadth of Deeres dealer network is unmatched, with over 2,000 dealer locations in North America and approximately 3,700 globally (has a significant presence on every continent). These dealers are often very large organizations that exclusively sell Deere products. We think its very difficult for existing competitors and new entrants to replicate the size and coverage of Deeres dealers. Fully stocking a branch is challenging without similar product breadth to Deere, hence, why many competitors products are sold at dealerships that carry multiple product lines. Deeres value proposition not only consists of its high-quality products, but it also includes the reliable product support provided by dealers. When customers need parts or machine servicing, they can rely on the dealer network to reduce their machine down-time.Deeres mission-critical equipment and increased focus on its installed base through aftermarket and service offerings keep customers from switching. The companys machines perform mission-critical functions for farmers, who work during a finite window during the year. For customers, switching to an alternative product poses significant risk to their operations, with the potential for disruptions from machine failures and long lead times to service equipment. The high cost of failure associated with switching away from Deeres products increases the likelihood of missing valuable time to plant and harvest crops, ultimately cutting into a farmers profitability. Deeres service agreements give customers priority on proprietary aftermarket parts and services from dealers, making it easy to understand what the total cost of a machine will be throughout its operating life.Furthermore, customers invest a significant amount of time and money into machinery, creating additional friction to switch products. The purchase price of heavy machinery can run up into the hundreds of thousands (and can get into the low-million-dollar range for combines), in addition to the time it takes machine operators to fully train on a machine to reach optimal productivity. The companys parts distribution and extensive dealer network provide customers with aftermarket parts and reliable services to ensure their equipment operate efficiently, saving them from the headache of machine down-time and from having to search for parts independently (parts are not easy to replace). Customers also find value in Deeres strong secondary market, where sellers of used equipment benefit from high resale values, helping reduce the total cost of ownership.We do not think Deeres wide economic moat faces any substantial threats from environmental, social, and governance risks. Deere has exposure to product safety issues, carbon emissions and environmental regulation, but we do not view them as material enough to include in our valuation. Product safety issues include both customer injuries while operating Deere machinery and injuries suffered by Deere employees in the production of products. Carbon emissions regulation is increasingly a topic of discussion, but we think Deere is already hedging against this risk through the development of next-generation products that reduce the carbon emissions of its products, namely its electric drivetrains.Additionally, we think the effect from climate change and regulation by government authorities will likely be incremental rather than immediate. Both the agriculture industry and academic institutions are studying how the effect of changing weather patterns will impact farmer growing operations. For example, academic institutions are focusing on the effects of growing crops in warmer climates. Technology is being used as a critical input to understand what factors drive successful crop generation under this scenario. Deere is also exposed to environmental regulation, largely stemming from the environmental impact that agricultural machines have on soil and water quality. We believe Deere faces little risk on this front, as the company continues to invest in next-generation products that will aim to reduce emissions.Another important topic in the agriculture space is the focus on gasoline blending mandates for internal combustion engine vehicles by government authorities around the world (corn is a major input to the ethanol used in gasoline blending). We think biofuel targets will lead to modest ethanol gasoline adoption, acting as a support to corn demand. However, this positive factor could be offset over the next two decades, as governments start to push for electric vehicle adoption, moving away from ICE vehicles.","We assign Deere a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. We continue to think that the most substantial risk to Deere is a declining commodity environment, given the firm's exposure to crops, such as corn, soybeans, and grains to name a few. The middle part of the last decade was an example of what can happen to corn and soybean prices when global supplies are high. A few years earlier, the reverse was true when prices spiked due to the U.S. drought. The lack of rainfall decreased crop yields and ultimately global supply. Over the past couple of years, prices have increased significantly, reaching relatively close to the level seen last decade. The rise in corn and soybean prices is attributed to strong demand from China and constrained global supply.In construction, we think the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal in the U.S. will be the main growth driver. Globally, we expect infrastructure spending in emerging markets to be relatively strong, as there is ample demand to build new roads and infrastructure to increase urbanization. However, an economic slowdown can quickly reverse investment in construction spending.We think the impact from climate change will be incremental, as the industry and academic institutions are studying ways to grow crops in warmer climates. Additionally, the potential for increased electric vehicle adoption could reduce demand for ethanol (corn is an input) used in internal combustion engine vehicles.Deere faces competition from global rivals, mainly CNH and to a lesser extent Agco. CNH is a viable threat, as its products have garnered strong brand loyalty among farmers. We think its unlikely that these firms can materially improve product quality to rival Deere, but we believe Deere will need to continually improve the efficiency of its products.","We assign Deere an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is exceptional and supports its competitive positioning. We also think Deeres shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think Deere has a sound balance sheet. The companys low balance sheet risk is largely due to its manageable debt levels and access to credit lines. We expect its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio and the number of debt maturities coming due in the near term to be relatively low. The captive finance arm does carry more debt, but we think this is reasonable given the nature of its operations. The business provides financing for both customers and dealers to support the sale of Deere products.Deeres investment strategy is exceptional, in our view. The companys acquisition strategy has been focused on expanding its product portfolio and digital capabilities. On the product side, Deere acquired Wirtgen, a road construction business in Germany. Deere bought the company for $5.2 billion in 2017 at a transaction multiple of 9.5 times enterprise value/2017 EBITDA, which we think was a fair price, with annual synergies of approximately EUR 100 million by 2022. We like the fact that Wirtgen expanded Deeres product portfolio from earth-moving equipment to include road construction and mineral equipment. The companys premium brands helped Deere move from a top-10 construction player globally to a top-three player. Also in 2017, Deere made a smaller purchase (about $300 million), acquiring Blue River Technology, an ag tech startup. This move illustrates Deeres commitment to investing in next-generation products that utilize computer vision and machine learning to make machines more efficient. Deere gained See & Spray, a sense and act technology that enables plant-level crop management. In 2021, Deere acquired Bear Flag (for about $300 million), the first to market with autonomous tractors. Deere was drawn to Bear Flags retrofit-first focus, meaning its autonomous technology is designed to be installed on existing equipment. The move sped up Deeres development efforts, culminating in the launch of its autonomous 8R tractor at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. Looking ahead, we expect Deere to strategically make acquisitions to boost its competitive positioning. We believe Deere will likely favor organic growth, propelled by investments in internal projects to improve product efficiency and performance. Deere has projected the incremental addressable market is over $150 billion (including small ag and construction markets). By comparison, our estimate of the incremental market opportunity comes in slightly above Deeres expectations, at about $161 billion. We define the market opportunity as the value precision ag creates for farmers, including input cost savings and increased crop yields. This contrasts with the traditional definition of TAM, which measures the total revenue opportunity. In our view, most of the value created will flow to farmers, while ag manufacturers capture the balance through hardware and software sales. In terms of revenue, we estimate Deere pulling in over $7 billion. For Deere, the goal is to get to 10% recurring revenue by 2030 from less than 1% today. We think the company can get there by connecting more machines and driving higher engagement in the John Deere Operations Center. We think this new operating model has the potential to drive higher profitability for the company, but wed like to see Deere gain some additional traction with customer adoption before baking in material sales growth into our forecast. Deere's precision ag prospects pushed management to raise its midcycle operating margin target to 20% by 2030 from 15% previously. We'd like to see the company achieve a few more milestones before materially raising our midcycle margin target. In our cash flow model, we assume operating margins will land at 17.4% by our midcycle year. Our forecast gives Deere additional credit for its precision ag efforts, but we're still taking a measured approach to midcycle margins.We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. Deere is committed to dividend payouts, increasing the dividend year over year and holding it steady during agricultural downturns. We expect a continued commitment to dividend payouts well into the future. Historically, share repurchases have fluctuated based on agricultural demand globally. We think management will be committed to consistently repurchasing shares, returning nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders throughout the economic cycle. In a midcycle environment, we expect free cash flow to be $8 billion.","Deere is the worlds leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, producing some of the most recognizable machines in the heavy machinery industry. The company is divided into four reportable segments: production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and John Deere Capital. Its products are available through an extensive dealer network, which includes over 2,000 dealer locations in North America and approximately 3,700 locations globally. John Deere Capital provides retail financing for machinery to its customers, in addition to wholesale financing for dealers, which increases the likelihood of Deere product sales.","Deere maintains a sound balance sheet. On the industrial side, the net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio was relatively low at the end of fiscal 2023, coming in below 1. Total outstanding debt, including both short- and long-term debt, was $8.4 billion. Deeres strong balance sheet gives management the financial flexibility to run a balanced capital allocation strategy going forward that mostly favors organic growth and also returns cash to shareholders. In terms of liquidity, we believe the company can meet its near-term debt obligations given its strong cash balance. The companys cash position as of fiscal year-end 2023 stood at $5.7 billion on its industrial balance sheet. We also find comfort in Deeres ability to tap into available lines of credit to meet any short-term needs. Deere has access to $3.3 billion in credit facilities.We think Deere can generate solid free cash flow throughout the economic cycle. We believe the company can generate $8 billion in free cash flow in our midcycle year, supporting its ability to return nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we think management is determined to rationalize its footprint by reducing the number of facilities in mature markets. If successful, this will put Deere on much better footing from a cost perspective, further supporting its ability to return cash to shareholders. The captive finance arm holds considerably more debt than the industrial business, but this is reasonable, given its status as a lender to both customers and dealers. Total debt stood at $48 billion in fiscal 2023, along with $51 billion in finance receivables and $1.7 billion in cash. In our view, Deere enjoys a strong financial position supported by a clean balance sheet and strong free cash flow prospects.",DE,Industrials,106217644032.0,NYQ,1758426.0,USD,370.760009765625,True,0,394.9588231703824,380.27642181772717,1
24/11/2023,Lowe's Judicious Investments Stand To Buoy Its Brand Cachet and Competitive Position,Lowe's Companies Inc,LOW,3,21/11/2023,Jaime Katz,198.48,USD,23/11/2023,213.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,B,21/11/2023,"Wide-moat Lowes third-quarter results included $20.5 billion in net sales and $3.06 in diluted earnings per share, edging our respective $20.2 billion and $2.97 estimates. More critically, gross and adjusted operating margins expanded 36 and 46 basis points to 33.7% and 13.2%, respectively, despite a 7.4% decline in comparable sales. We think these marks show the firms focus on expense management and ability to pull diverse levers to blunt sales deleverage. However, management's tempered full-year outlook for $86 billion in net sales (from $87 billion-$89 billion) and $13 in adjusted EPS (from $13.20-$13.60) suggests that comparable sales will decelerate further in the fourth quarter. As we incorporate these results, the weaker full-year guidance, and time value, we plan to trim our $213 fair value estimate by a low-single-digit percentage, in line with the markets reaction, rendering the shares a tad undervalued. The key narrative was analogous to wide-moat Home Depots recent report, as soft do-it-yourself discretionary spending was the major drag on comparable sales. Comp transactions and comp average ticket dropped 6.9% and 0.5%, respectively, with big tickets (purchases above $500) falling 9.8%, softening from the 4.6% decline a quarter ago. While we dont anticipate a turnaround in sales momentum until mid-2024, we see no reason to change our long-term view. On top of Lowe's low-cost position (thanks to its robust scale, which underpins our wide moat rating), we believe efforts to expand higher-margin private-label offerings, leverage strategic pricing tactics, and unlock store productivity and greater wallet share through a localization strategy in rural areasroughly 17% of its store baseshould bear fruit. We believe Lowes can reach nearly 15% operating margin longer term, from 13% in fiscal 2022, and is poised to take incremental share in the fragmented North American home improvement market.","We forecast Lowe's to reach a 13.3% operating margin in 2023, after divesting the dilutive Canadian business and investing in productivity efforts. Higher home prices and aging housing stock support demand, generating an estimated cumulative free cash flow to the firm of $48 billion over the next five years, which should help finance nearly $30 billion in repurchases. Perpetual productivity initiatives, which could improve the supply chain and inventory management could boost inventory turnover and working capital generation above levels that we currently anticipate.","The closure of smaller peers may intermittently lead to competitive pricing pressures at Lowe's, constraining ROIC expansion and limiting sales growth. Higher interest rates, flat housing price growth, or tighter lending standards could slow inventory turnover, postponing home improvement projects and hindering Lowe's sales. Lower sales could pressure profitability if lower-margin acquired businesseslike those that compose the Lowe's Pro Supply lineoperate less than optimally. Further margin pressure could ensue if growing pro and MRO demand become difficult.",29/08/2023,"Lowe's is the second-largest home improvement retailer globally, set to capture around $90 billion in sales in 2023. With continued focus on retail fundamentals (merchandising excellence, operational efficiency, supply chain improvements, omnichannel shopping experience, and customer engagement), Lowe's has been able to better leverage costs while maintaining its low-cost position. The firm retains some of the cost savings and passes the rest on to its customers through everyday low prices. These competitive advantages support our wide economic moat rating. Since Marvin Ellison took the helm in 2018, a full overhaul of Lowe's C-suite, board, and merchandising team has ensued. With an perpetual productivity plan now bearing fruit, incremental profit margin gains should continue. Thanks to the institutionalization of processes that were inefficient (including labor management, reset efforts, and inventory controls), and the divestiture of underperforming lines, the operating margin is now forecast to reach 13.3% in 2023, up from 9.1% in 2019. Additionally, demand in home improvements stemming from an aging housing market, along with still robust home prices supporting a positive wealth effect (despite higher interest rates), positions the firm for further cost leverage. With structural changes that have included the closure of the Orchard Supply brand and the sale of its Mexican and Canadian assets, capital expenditures (estimated at $2 billion in 2023) are likely to focus on efforts that should lead to working capital efficiency gains ahead. Lowe's updated its long-term financial goals in December 2022, which target a long-term operating margin of 14.5% and returns on invested capital of 45%. With the firm expected to reach a 13.3% operating margin and 34% ROICs in 2023 (by our math), we think a progression toward both operating margin and ROICs goals is reasonable given structural changes that have occurred. Lowe's still has opportunities in underserved domestic markets (city, rural) and via wider professional penetration, bolstered by past tie-ups of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and Central Wholesalers (now Lowe's Pro Supply, or LPS).","We assign Lowes a wide economic moat. As the second-largest global home improvement retailer, we believe Lowes will continue to gain incremental share in the North American home improvement retail segment (which Lowe's has estimated at around a $1 trillion market), given its extensive distribution network and economies of scale as well as the brand awareness it has built with consumers and professionals. Dissecting the components of its competitive prowess, Lowe's has been able to capture economic rents from its brand, offering an important intangible asset. This is evidenced in consistent same-store sales growth, which has averaged 7.7% over the past five years (just 90 basis points below its peer Home Depot). Furthermore, continued improvements in merchandising strategy, the supply chain, and a focus on meeting pro consumer demands should support the brand, driving both additional same-store sales growth (3% on average beyond fiscal 2023) and operating margin expansion over the next decade (to 14.5%, near wide-moat Home Depot and up roughly 500 basis points relative to the average margin chalked up in the five years preceding the pandemic). Historically, the business was built on topnotch customer service, knowledge, and innovation, which has let the firm amass around 10% share of the highly fragmented $1 trillion home improvement market (with around $90 billion in 2023 expected sales). The reliability of information that consumers can draw upon from associates is unlikely to be replicated easily; Home Depot is the sole competitor that offers a similar level of knowledge, although Tractor Supply offers consistent service levels in its respective categories. In addition, Lowes has worked hard to ensure that the appropriate staff is on hand to solve any problems that its customers may encounter. Labor has been a core focus of the management team in recent years, with efforts to reallocate 60% of workers to service (40% prior to the change in 2018) rather than stocking hours as a means to increase productivity, which the prior management team had struggled to execute successfully. Leveraging technology has allowed Lowe's to reduce duplicative tasks, perform faster cross-functional training across departments, and strategically deploy its team to eliminate non-productive hours and extract productivity in its stores. The companys strategies have helped it deliver average adjusted returns on invested capital, including goodwill, of 28% over the past five years, significantly higher than our 8% weighted average cost of capital estimate. In our view, ROICs should remain north of our cost of capital over the next 20 years (with ROICs ultimately reaching 42% in 2032), supporting our wide-moat rating. From the brand portfolio perspective, Lowes continues to find new ways to innovate through product launches, private-label and exclusive offerings, and services. Apart from approximately 30 trusted national brands (including Whirlpool, Samsung, GE, DeWalt, and more), Lowes houses 12 private-label brands (including allen+roth, Kobalt, Origin21, among others) that foster consumer loyalty, brand positioning, and margin gain opportunities. This is a particularly lucrative opportunity as we estimate private-label sales boast higher gross margins for Lowes that are a few hundred basis points above national brands (in line with other consumer retail industries). Lowes is pursuing a balanced growth approach, targeting national brand expansion for professional customers (as this cohort tends to rely on national brands for projects), while primarily extending private brands for do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me customers, who tend to be brand agnostic. We contend the familiarity and quality of the brands offered as well as the robust knowledge of the employee base keep the business in the forefront of consumers' minds as the premier choice for home improvement needs, and we believe the specialized nature of Lowe's offerings provides some protection from mass merchants and large online retailers (which could find it difficult to capture better pricing). Evidence of recent brand strength stems from outstanding average ticket growth of 7% on average over the past five fiscal years. Apart from its brand intangible asset, we think the company's size (operating more than 1,700 stores throughout the United States) has allowed for significant bargaining power with vendors when sourcing products, crafting advertisements, and arranging logistics (among other things). As a low cost one-stop shop for any home improvement need, Lowe's provides value and instills customer loyalty by passing along a portion of these savings in the form of everyday low pricing, EDLP. The ability to apply EDLP tactics is a result of negotiating clout due to scale as savings from bulk purchases allow for this pricing mechanism. And we think EDLP drives a positive flywheel effect, keeping customers more likely to return as they understand the value proposition offered by the company driving further scale gains. As evidence, Lowes recorded total transactions of 937 million in 2022, from 878 million in 2015 (up 6.7%) and average ticket has risen to $103.64 from $67.26 over the same time frame (up 54%). Additionally, we assess the pricing strategy as successful given the stability of gross margins, which have clocked in the 33% range since 2018a level we believe should persist as any scale benefits gained are likely to pass directly to consumers given the EDLP strategy. Furthermore, we think the company can build on its cost advantage through increasing speed in the supply chain, leveraging payroll, lowering operating expenses by improving inventory management (turns), and consolidating the procurement of some goods and services across the corporate and store channels. These efforts should compress selling, general, and administrative, SG&A, spend to 17.1% of sales by the end of our forecast, from 18.4% in 2022. All in, these factors should lead to an operating margin of 14.5% in 2032 (up from 13% in 2022). With consumers increasingly favoring retailers with a robust omnichannel presence, manufacturers without such capabilities to offer a seamless multichannel shopping experience could struggle to attract customers. We surmise around half of e-commerce transactions (which represented a low-double-digit percentage of 2022 sales) at Lowes were ordered online and picked up in store, implying more than $10 billion worth of goods stemmed from an omnichannel transaction over the year. For perspective, online penetration was just around 5% in 2018, but we expect it can continue to expand to a low- to midteens rate in the near term as buy online pickup in store and other omnichannel efforts are adopted more widely by the professional consumer base. From our vantage point, this offering should prompt further market share gains, with our forecast calling for the firm to garner a 13%-14% market share over the next decade.In our opinion, it would be difficult for another retailer to enter the market and threaten Lowes position, as smaller retailers would have a hard time building vendor relationships strong enough to undermine the companys pricing prowess. While the threat of manufacturers creating their own retail network could jeopardize the availability of product in Lowes retail channel, we doubt such an endeavor would be successful in the longer term. In our opinion, manufacturers would be poised to move more product by maintaining a beneficial relationship with a wholesale network like Lowes, rather than on their own; additionally, we expect that consumers would still prefer to save time and effort by visiting one shop for all of a projects needs, rather than purchasing products separately from each manufacturer.","We assign Lowe's a Medium Uncertainty Rating due to its strong brand recognition, which has helped stabilize sales through the cycle. Lowe's operates in a cyclical retail environment in which sales are driven in large part by homeowners' spending. With the heightened level of existing-home prices (and thus elevated home equity), we don't see imminent concern around a significant slowdown in repair and remodel spend, per se; however, with interest rates that could continue to move higher, uncertainty around the direction of the economic environment could temper discretionary spend broadly (recently displayed by consumers trading down to smaller ticket projects). Turnover of homes is a key factor driving home improvement spend. Existing home sales growth had stabilized at the beginning of 2020 until COVID-19 struck, sending existing-home sales tumbling at a double-digit pace between April and June 2020, before achieving a consistent recovery. However, existing home sales have contracted meaningfully in recent months, and any additional economic headwinds, like spike in unemployment, predatory pricing tactics, or slowdown in consumer confidence could reduce revenue and profitability. Additionally, in our opinion, Lowe's has only minimal environmental, social, and governance risk. While there is some risk associated with product sourcing and potential data theft, the biggest issue we foresee on the horizon is in consumer's shifting preferences to maintainable product offerings. We expect Lowe's to adapt, and as such, do not see any material financial impact from such exposure.","Our capital allocation rating for Lowe's is Exemplary. Forecast adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill (36% on average over the next five years) are set to handily outpace our weighted cost of capital estimate (at 8%) over our entire outlook. Additionally, the balance sheet remains sound, given the company's medium revenue cyclicality and decent operating leverage. A manageable level of debt is coming due over the next few years, and as such, we aren't concerned with capital demands. With net debt/EBITDA that should average around 2 times over the next decade, there is some financial flexibility on the balance sheet.From a leadership perspective, significant management changes had occurred on the heels of D.E. Shaw taking a position in Lowe's (2017), with three new board members initially appointed to the business. Since the beginning of 2018, Lowes hired a new CEO, new chief digital officer (from Amazon), as well as heads of merchandising (Chevron), stores (J.C. Penney, Home Depot), and supply chain (Walmart), and a new CFO (internal succession). Marvin Ellison took the reins from longtime CEO Robert Niblock in July 2018 and brought a tremendous amount of retail knowledge to the business, having previously held the role of CEO of J.C. Penney and acting as a longtime executive at wide-moat peer Home Depot.We hold a positive view on Lowe's investment strategy, as we think it is spending strategically to maintain its competitive advantages and respond rapidly to evolving consumer demand patterns. Quantitatively, we believe this is supported by robust ROIC and improving operating margin performance (reaches 14.5% over our forecast).Furthermore, we deem cash distributions as appropriate, with the management team returning capital to shareholders when optimal. As such, it suspended share repurchases early in the COVID-19 cycle but restarted opportunistic purchases in the final quarter of 2020) thanks to the strong demand that has persisted during the pandemic. Lowe's has consistently raised its dividend in recent years, and we expect it will continue to do so ahead, further returning excess capital to shareholders.","Lowe's is the second-largest home improvement retailer in the world, operating more than 1,700 stores in the United States, after the 2023 divestiture of its Canadian locations (RONA, Lowes Canada, Rno-Dpt, and Dicks Lumber). The firms stores offer products and services for home decorating, maintenance, repair, and remodeling, with maintenance and repair accounting for two thirds of products sold. Lowe's targets retail do-it-yourself (around 75% of sales) and do-it-for-me customers as well as commercial and professional business clients (around 25% of sales). We estimate Lowe's captures a low-double-digit share of the domestic home improvement market, based on U.S. Census data and managements market size estimates.","Despite increasing leverage in recent years, with the debt/total capital ratio rising from 32% in 2011 to 172% in 2022, we believe the company is in decent financial health thanks to the robust free cash flow it generates. Debt maturities are spread out evenly, and we do not believe they will present any cash flow issues. The firm easily covers net interest expense around 11 times with its earnings before interest and tax (2022). The firm raised nearly $10 billion in 2022 for general corporate purposes (it expects to increase net debt by $7 billion between 2023 and 2025). Management's net debt/EBITDAR target remains at 2.75 times, a level metric Lowe's should easily remain within over the next five years. For reference, Home Depot's net debt/EBITDAR target is 2 times.Lowe's generated average annual free cash flow to the firm of $8.3 billion over the past five years as the housing market remained healthy. We believe this level of robust free cash flow helps to support the company's $36 billion long-term debt load along with $3.65 billion in noncurrent operating lease liabilities. Lowe's resumed share repurchases in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 (after halting payment earlier in 2020 in response to COVID-19 uncertainty), allowing the firm to buy back $5 billion in shares during 2020. Lowe's followed up with another $13 billion in repurchases in 2021 and $14 billion in 2022. We model nearly $20 billion in share repurchases between 2023 and 2025 as free cash flow remains robust. Lowe's owns most of its stores, and the balance sheet has $17.4 billion in net property, plant, and equipment, providing an asset base to secure debt if necessary.",LOW,Consumer Cyclical,117277048832.0,NYQ,2927406.0,USD,198.47999572753903,True,1,211.15388273351644,223.23037003881728,1
24/11/2023,Aon Should Enjoy Stable But Modest Growth Over Time,Aon PLC,AON,2,27/10/2023,Brett Horn,328.98,USD,23/11/2023,291.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,27/10/2023,"Aon reported solid third-quarter results that reflect a favorable industry backdrop, but its results continue to lag its closest peer. Overall revenue grew 10% year over year, or 6% on an organic basis. Organic growth is still a bit above what we expect long-term. We will maintain our $291 fair value estimate for the narrow-moat company and see shares as slightly overvalued. Year-over-year growth in the Commercial Risk and Reinsurance segments was 4% and 11%, respectively, on an organic basis. We think the tailwind from better primary insurance pricing may be starting to ebb, but a stronger reinsurance market is picking up the slack to some extent. This area of the business is also benefiting from higher interest rates and better fiduciary income, which boosted overall growth by 2 percentage points. The Health and Wealth segment followed recent trends with 10% and 4% year-over-year growth, respectively, on an organic basis. We think the Health segment has much better long-term growth prospects longer-term. Adjusted operating margins improved to 24.3% from 23.1% last year. The increase appears to be entirely because of better fiduciary income, which falls almost completely to the bottom line. Excluding this factor, we believe margins would have compressed modestly. Management announced a cost savings plan that will include a $900 million charge but should result in $350 million in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2026. Aon, in this respect, seems to be following the lead of Marsh McLennan, which recently announced a similar plan. We think the failed Willis Towers Watson merger might take large-scale M&A off the table for Aon, and a greater focus on efficiency would be an appropriate pivot.","The tollbooth nature of its brokerage operations makes Aon a relatively stable producer of free cash flow. Aons established corporate relationships provide an opportunity to enter and cross-sell new services and move into a larger risk-management role over time. Management estimates that the top four global brokers have only about 30% market share, leaving plenty of space to expand without intense head-to-head competition.","Aon's established position in relatively mature markets lowers its long-term growth prospects. Aon has historically shown a willingness to expand into new areas, and this could potentially dilute its moat. Aon has aggressively repurchased stock in recent years, implying that management sees little opportunity for value-creative reinvestment.",10/10/2023,"Aon historically has demonstrated modest growth and strong and stable free cash flow, and we expect much of the same going forward, although swings in the insurance market and the pandemic have created some recent ups and downs. In our view, Aon is a fundamentally attractive business, with a variety of operations that share the commonality of sticky customer relationships, limited capital requirements, and flexible cost structures.  In recent years, Aon saw a modest headwind turn into a tailwind. Because Aon generally takes a percentage of premiums as commission, it is exposed to the direction of the insurance pricing cycle. In 2019, pricing momentum picked up, and this positive trend accelerated in 2020. as the coronavirus appears to have acted as an additional spur to pricing. Pricing increases haven't been this strong in almost 20 years. This has boosted Aon's growth a bit in the near term and has helped offset any negative impacts the coronavirus has on the more discretionary areas of the business. With discretionary services now bouncing back as the pandemic recedes, Aon saw unusually strong growth over the past couple of years. But these tailwinds should dissipate over time. Aon has been busy in recent years, taking bold steps to reshape its business and improve its efficiency. Before the pandemic, Aon announced its intention to merge with Willis Towers Watson in a $30 billion all-stock deal. This deal was called off in July after resistance from U.S. regulators, and Aon paid a $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. While management will have to take a step back and reassess following the failure to complete the Willis Towers Watson merger, we think management has a good record when it comes to balancing expansion opportunities and maintaining the companys competitive position, which gives us confidence. We also like that Aon has been focusing on improving cost efficiency.","Aon's relatively sticky client base and its global presence are the main sources for its narrow economic moat. Through its risk solutions segment, Aon acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients to manage their risk by negotiating and placing their insurance risks with insurance carriers through its global distribution network. Insurance brokers such as Aon are uniquely positioned to serve a necessary risk management function. Brokers can search the insurance market more efficiently and effectively than individual buyers, helping clients to compare insurers' skills, financial strengths, and reputation. During the matching process, brokers also help insurers solve problems related to asymmetric information, such as adverse selection and moral hazard. The complexity of these services creates switching costs, as we believe the value of changing providers is not clear to customers and there is perceived value for the client in continuing to work with a broker that has experience in managing their risk. As a result, Aons client retention rates are typically over 90%. While 80% of Aons clients are middle-market companies, Aons global presence limits potential competition at the top end of the corporate market as it allows Aon to effectively serve multinational customers that smaller brokers cannot. Additionally, the scale and breadth of its operations allows the company to build out a wider set of data and experience, which we believe improves the value of its services even at the middle-market level.Aon's human resources business is more diffuse and operates in several markets with differing levels of competition. Operating margins, excluding purchase amortization expenses and one-time charges, have been lower than on the brokerage side historically, suggesting this side of the business is not as advantaged as brokerage operations but still benefits from relatively sticky customer relationships. The sale of its benefits administration and human resources BPO business eliminated the lowest-margin business on this side, however.Ultimately, we see Aon as a relatively stable business that benefits from minimal capital requirements and enduring relationships. Returns on invested capital excluding goodwill have been trending in a positive direction and are multiples above any reasonable estimate of the cost of capital.","On the brokerage side, Aons primary exposure is to the insurance pricing cycle, as commissions are often calculated as a percentage of premium. However, insurance is also a heavily regulated industry, which can affect Aon as well. The brokerage industry has historically had some material issues on the regulatory front. On the human resources side, Aons exposure is primarily to the health of the employment market and general macroeconomic conditions, as any headwinds in these areas could limit clients' willingness to pay for Aons services. Aons largest cost component by far is employee compensation, which could lead to pressure on margins if labor conditions grew tight and any large-scale employee defections could damage the business. Aons international footprint creates currency and operational risks.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we view the largest risk for Aon and other brokers as business ethics and managing potential conflicts of interest. Historically, the industry has had issues with contract structures such as contingent commissions. However, we see no major flags at the moment for Aon.","Our capital allocation rating for Aon is Exemplary. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.Greg Case has served as CEO since 2005 and has made major changes to the organization during his tenure that we believe have been mostly value-creative. Under his watch, the companys business has shifted from an insurance-focused organization into a provider of a wider set of risk management tools. We believe Case deserves credit for embarking on a fairly aggressive path to reposition the business, and more importantly for doing so in a manner that did not dilute the moat surrounding its legacy operations.In 2008, Aon made two major moves. First, it sold its insurance underwriting operations. In our view, this move away from capital-intensive operations was a material positive. Also in 2008, Aon acquired Benfield Group, a leading reinsurance broker, in a move that expanded its reinsurance brokerage capabilities and global reach. We believe Aons global footprint is a key factor in its competitive positioning at the top end of the brokerage market and therefore view this move positively from a moat perspective.Aon acquired Hewitt Associates, a leading HR consulting and outsourcing firm, in 2010 for $4.3 billion. This deal nearly tripled the size of the company's consulting business, making it far less reliant on its insurance brokerage operations. Small bolt-on acquisitions further expanded its noninsurance operations and created some balance to the firms operations. While this expansion moved Aons away from its core business and synergies between the two sides of the business are limited, we see a reasonable strategic connection and do not believe the expansion has meaningfully diluted Aons overall competitive position. After years of contenting itself with relatively small deals, Aon announced in 2020 that it would merge with Willis Towers Watson in an all-stock deal. Management suggested that the strategic rationale for the deal primarily hinged on building a larger entity that is more capable of improving data and analytic capabilities in order to better adjust to the new types of risks clients are facing. This didnt strike us as a deeply compelling rationale, and the deal was ultimately called off due to regulatory concerns. While this ended up being a poor use of management's time and Aon was forced to pay a $1 billion termination fee, we don't see the failure to complete this deal as a significant blow to the company's competitive position.In recent years, the majority of Aon's free cash flow has been used to buy back shares, supporting the idea that the aggressive moves earlier in Cases tenure were not simply empire building but part of a thoughtful plan to reposition the business. The sale of a substantial portion of the human resources business, while it marked something of a reversal of course by offloading some of the assets acquired in the Hewitt deal, supports this point. The history of the industry suggests M&A will always be part of the company's strategy, but the failure to complete the Willis Towers Watson deal suggests transformative acquisitions might be off the table.","Aon is a leading global provider of insurance and reinsurance brokerage and human resource solutions. Its operations are tilted toward its brokerage operations. Headquartered in London, Aon has about 50,000 employees and operations in over 120 countries around the world.","We believe Aons capital structure is appropriate, given its level of business risk. Aon has increased leverage a bit over the past few years to finance a relatively high level of stock repurchases, and debt/EBITDA was 2.7 times at the end of 2022. Barring any major acquisition activity, the company has significant capital structure flexibility given its ample and fairly steady free cash flow, and we would expect leverage to stay in the 2-3 times range for the foreseeable future. However, we would not view a move to leverage above that level favorably.",AON,Financial Services,65424580608.0,NYQ,850792.0,USD,328.9800109863281,True,0,326.41094180836234,310.1025906786556,0
24/11/2023,Amazon Is an E-Commerce Juggernaut and Enjoys a Wide Moat,Amazon.com Inc,AMZN,3,27/10/2023,Dan Romanoff,146.71,USD,23/11/2023,155.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,B,27/10/2023,"Wide-moat Amazon reported good third-quarter results and provided better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter. Profitability was strong and is expected to remain healthy in the near term. While e-commerce was solid and continues to rebound, Amazon Web Services optimization has stabilized, although growth fell slightly shy of our expectations. Still, commentary was encouraging about AWS improving further over the next several quarters. Continued operational improvements brought on by the move to regional hubs have resulted in better operating leverage than anticipated. We still envision healthy long-term growth driven by e-commerce proliferation, AWS, and advertising, and believe the biggest near-term issue remains the health of the consumer rather than business spending on the cloud. After increasing our profitability assumptions modestly based on results and guidance, we are increasing our fair value estimate to $155 per share, from $150 previously, and see shares as attractive. We continue to see positive developments on the demand front. Third-quarter revenue grew 13% year over year as reported and 11% in constant currency, to $143.1 billion, compared with the high end of guidance at $143 billion. The two key segments, AWS and advertising, grew 12% and 26% as reported, respectively, over the year-ago period. Amazons advertising growth continues to outpace that of its large internet peers. Relative to our model, online stores, third-party seller services, or 3P, and advertising drove the vast majority of upside. AWS, physical stores, and other were each slightly shy of our expectations. Profitability was impressive, with operating profit coming in at $11.2 billion, compared with the high end of guidance at $8.5 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 7.8%, compared with 2.0% a year ago. This is the second-highest margin level in at least the last five years. North America, International, and the AWS segment all saw margins expanding sequentially.","Amazon is the clear leader in e-commerce and enjoys unrivaled scale to continue to invest in growth opportunities and drive the very best customer experience.

 High-margin advertising and AWS are growing faster than the corporate average, which should continue to boost profitability over the next several years. Amazon Prime memberships help attract and retain customers who spend more with Amazon; this reinforces a powerful network effect while bringing in recurring and high-margin revenue.","Regulatory concerns are rising for large technology firms, including Amazon. Further, the firm may face increasing regulatory and compliance issues as it expands internationally. New investments, notably in fulfillment, delivery, and AWS, should damp free cash flow growth. Also, Amazons penetration into some countries might be harder than in the U.S. due to inferior logistic networks. Amazon may not be as successful in penetrating new retail categories, such as luxury goods, due to consumer preferences and an improved e-commerce experience from larger retailers.",27/10/2023,"Amazon dominates its served markets, notably e-commerce and cloud services. It benefits from numerous competitive advantages and has emerged as the clear e-commerce leader thanks to its size and scale, which yield an unmatched selection of low-priced goods for consumers. The secular drift toward e-commerce continues unabated with the company continuing to grind out market share gains despite its size. Prime ties Amazons e-commerce efforts together and provides a steady stream of high-margin recurring revenue from customers who purchase more frequently from Amazons properties. In return, consumers get one-day shipping on millions of items, exclusive video content, and other services; this results in a powerful virtuous circle where customers and sellers attract one another. Kindle and other devices further bolster the ecosystem by helping attract new customers while making the value proposition irresistible in retaining existing customers. Through Amazon Web Services, Amazon is also a clear leader in public cloud services. Additionally, the firms advertising business is already large and continues to scale, thus offering an attractive option for marketers looking to access a vast audience with a variety of proprietary data points about those very consumers. AWS and advertising growth should continue to outpace e-commerce growth. We expect these areas to be the main growth drivers over the next five years. This is critical, as each of these segments drives higher margins than the corporate average, which in turn should allow both operating profit and EPS to outgrow revenue as margins continue to expand. From a retail perspective, we expect continued innovation to help drive further share gains in a post-lockdown world. We also look for continued penetration into categories such as groceries and luxury goods that have not previously translated into the same level of success as other retail categories. We also see technology advancements in AWS and a bigger push to service enterprise customers as helping to maintain the companys lead there. Overall, we see strong revenue and free cash flow growth for years to come. ","We assign a wide moat rating to Amazon based on network effects, cost advantages, intangible assets, and switching costs. Amazon has been disrupting the traditional retail industry for more than two decades while also emerging as the leading infrastructure-as-a-service provider via Amazon Web Services. This disruption has been embraced by consumers and has driven change across the entire industry as traditional retailers have invested heavily in technology in order to keep pace. COVID-19 has accelerated change, and given the company's technological prowess, massive scale, and relationship with consumers, we think Amazon has widened its lead, which we believe will result in economic returns well in excess of its cost of capital for years to come.We believe Amazons retail business has a wide moat stemming from network effects associated with its marketplace, where more buyers and sellers continually attract more buyers and sellers; a cost advantage tied to purchasing power, logistics, vertical integration (proprietary brands, owned delivery, and so on), and a negative cash conversion cycle; and intangible assets associated with technology and branding. We also believe AWS is a wide-moat business, thanks to high customer switching costs; a cost advantage associated with economies of scale where few competitors can keep up with Amazons investment pace; intangible assets arising from semiconductor and facility development; and a network effect associated with a marketplace for software created to make AWS work better. We also would assign Amazons burgeoning advertising business a narrow moat based on intangible assets from its proprietary data on hundreds of millions of users and a network effect again focusing on buyers and sellers meeting in the largest available venues. We believe that the wide moat for Amazons entire business is greater than the sum of its parts; we prefer to analyze Amazons moat on the whole, as the company's segments reinforce one another and returns result in an unrivaled consumer experience.Together, we believe Amazons retail business enjoys a wide moat supported by cost advantages, intangible assets, and network effects. We assess the moat around Amazons retail business based on a combination of online stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, and physical stores, as we find it challenging to think about durable competitive advantages for each of these segments in isolation. Given its massive scale, Amazon has created cost advantages including buying power, economies of scope, route density, and research and development. From a total gross merchandise value perspective, with approximately $580 billion in 2021, it finally surpassed Walmart. Similarly, Amazon is the largest online retailer and is an order of magnitude larger than Walmart and 4 times larger than Shopify, assuming we classify Shopify as a demand aggregator. Additionally, the company has become more vertically integrated over time and most recently has built out its own transportation network. Size dictates certain scales of efficiency, but we think Amazon is the definition of operational excellence. These advantages are related and reinforce one another in a virtuous circle. Low prices and an unmatched selection have come to define the company in consumers minds, giving rise to intangible assets from branding and technology (search capabilities and recommendation engine). Product searches are more likely to begin on Amazon at this point than they are Google. Amazon has become the only demand aggregator at scale in the U.S. because of its wide selection, intelligent recommendation algorithms, low prices, and convenience, which combine into a powerful business model.We also believe Amazons retail business benefits from network effects. The sheer number of consumers shopping on Amazon makes it attractive to third party sellers, while the marketplace expands the selection available to shoppers and makes Amazon a more attractive online destination for consumers. In fact, 50%-55% of total goods sold by Amazon are through its third-party marketplace. At the heart of third-party seller services is the commission Amazon collects from the independent seller. However, these services also include Fulfillment by Amazon, distribution facility storage, shipping, payment processing, and other related items.To improve the consumer experience and more tightly tie users to Amazon, the company has moved increasingly into content. Consumers can now have Prime Video, Music Unlimited, Kindle Unlimited, Prime Gaming, and other similar subscription services. The company even produces original content for Prime Video to help reinforce the notion that consumers can get anything they need from Amazon. We view the Kindle, Echo, Fire, and other Amazon original devices as interesting on their own merits, but think the underlying point is to once again draw in more consumers to Amazons retail properties and engage those customers that are already within the ecosystem. Amazons hardware helps to enable Amazons services. The Kindle, for example, dovetails perfectly with Kindle Unlimited, which for a $9.99 monthly subscription, allows users to read from a selection of more than one million book titles. The company even offers a direct-to-Kindle book publishing service. The common thread that weaves throughout Amazons retail business is Amazon Prime, which for $139 per year allows users unlimited free shipping on millions of stock-keeping units, including same-day or one-day shipping on many items, access to Prime Video and Prime Music, and a variety of other benefits. We view Prime subscriptions and the differentiated user experience they offer as critical to attracting and retaining customers. Prime memberships generate high cash flow that can be reinvested in further improving the user experience on the technology, content, and delivery fronts. Prime customers are very sticky and tend to purchase from Amazon more frequently and across more retail categories. We think content combined with Prime subscriptions actually build a switching cost that consumers would need to overcome, although these switching costs might not last for decades in order to warrant it as a moat source.Advertising is tangentially related to Amazons retail operations in that it takes place on Amazons own online properties. Advertising is growing rapidly and is likely the segment with the highest operating margins in Amazons portfolio, likely in excess of 30%, which is would be directionally comparable to margins earned by Facebook when it was a similarly sized business (other was $21 billion in revenue in 2020, compared with $18 billion in revenue for Facebook in 2015). We believe advertising dollars flow to where the eyeballs are and where information is known about the online user, which fits in very well with Amazons strengths. We therefore expect advertising to grow rapidly over the next several years and continue to boost the companys overall profitability. Looking at advertising in isolation, we would likely give it a narrow moat rating based on intangible assets arising from proprietary technology (data), and network effects, although assigning a moat rating here is difficult because Amazon doesnt disclose much about this business. That said, we can see Amazons advertising becoming a wide-moat business as it becomes more established and more details are disclosed. We think Amazons advertising business is attractive to advertisers because there is proprietary information about the consumers and real-time data about when they are searching for a particular product, and Amazon already enjoys substantial traffic. We expect this business to continue to grow rapidly and offer an attractive alternative to platforms from social network and internet search providers.Amazon Web Services enjoys a wide moat supported by switching costs, network effects, intangible assets, and cost advantages. Amazon was a pioneer in public cloud infrastructure as a service and platform as a service and retains a substantial lead over its closest rival, Microsoft. AWS has driven profitability for the entire company; although it represents 10%-15% of revenue, it generates 60%-65% of total operating profit dollars for Amazon. We also expect AWS to remain a key growth driver for the company over the next decade.AWS differs from the companys e-commerce operations in that it is enterprise-facing rather than consumer-facing. Enterprise customers rely on AWS for core IT infrastructure, which represents significant switching costs in terms of the time and expense of integrating applications with core software elements, such as the database, and dedicates a user to a specific set of software development tools. Ultimately, the operational risks to changing mission-critical technology infrastructure is high, which is why core elements such as ERP systems and cloud providers are rarely changed.Further, we believe it is cheaper initially for companies to move workloads to the cloud, as there are fewer up-front costs and a lower bar to clear for maintenance and administration. Additionally, Amazon has devoted significant R&D resources to adding advanced features to the platform. Along those lines, AWS offers scale advantages to clients in that it is cheaper and faster to set up IT infrastructure in the cloud compared with undertaking the same effort independently. Customers also benefit from the ability to scale up compute power for burst requirements, paying for only what they need and having it available effectively on-demand. We have seen some of the largest technology companies in the world simply fail to keep pace with Amazons massive investments in IaaS over the years, and AWS cost advantage over its rivals is obvious. Those firms struggle to compete in a meaningful way against AWS.Amazon has amassed significant technology and process knowledge, which we believe is an intangible asset for the firm as a whole and also for AWS. These assets could also apply to the logistics aspect of the retail business. The company expanded its distribution network by roughly 50% in 2020 while managing through a global pandemic. Given the size of its footprint, this is a monumental achievement and speaks to the companys ability to quickly plan, construct, and expand facilities based on specific needs. The knowledge base to quickly and efficiently bring massive server farms online for AWS is similarly impressive and only comes from the experience of previously building hyperscale data centers. Additionally, the firm designs its own semiconductors, which are used to power its server arrays, and also developed proprietary robotic automation technology used in its fulfillment centers.As with other large software companies, we see a network effect within AWS ecosystem for third-party software, although we view this as more of secondary moat source. The large ecosystem of AWS users has benefited from the software development efforts of those same users, as they turn around and offer applications written on AWS for AWS users. Thus, users help attract other users to AWS. We see Microsoft and Salesforce in particular as the best comparable examples in software of creating network effects. We think network effects, intangible assets, cost advantages, and switching combine to form a powerful moat for all of Amazon. We think many of these areas reinforce one another and see little difficulty in Amazon continuing to deliver returns on invested capital well in excess of its cost of capital over the long term.","We believe that the uncertainty for Amazon is high and that despite being an e-commerce leader, the company faces a variety of risks.Amazon must protect its leading online retailing position, which can be challenging as consumer preferences change, especially post-COVID-19 (as consumers may revert to prior behaviors), and traditional retailers bolster their online presence. Maintaining an e-commerce edge has pushed the company to make investments in nontraditional areas, such as producing content for Prime Video and building out its own transportation network. Similarly, the company must also maintain an attractive value proposition for its third-party sellers. Some of these investment areas have raised investor questions in the past, and we expect management to continue to invest according to its strategy, despite periodic margin pressure from increased spending.The company must also continue to invest in new offerings. AWS, transportation, and physical stores (both Amazon branded and Whole Foods) are three notable areas of investment. These decisions require capital allocation and management focus and may play out over a period of years rather than quarters.Continued international expansion will likely require similar investment and management attention but will also increase exposure to different regulatory environments. Some countries have instituted or may institute protectionist policies. Even domestically over the last several years, lawmakers from both parties have increasingly focused on the amount of market power large technology companies have accrued. Antitrust, data privacy, and section 230 have been repeatedly invoked.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, data breaches and service outages are a concern for any type of cloud service provider. As a retailer, Amazon has personal information for hundreds of millions of consumers around the world, while AWS hosts proprietary mission-critical data for enterprises.","We assign Amazon an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is most likely to be the key driver of total shareholder returns and is therefore appropriately prioritized over other capital returns such as dividends and buybacks, which Amazon does not offer.The balance sheet is sound with a net cash position. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound as the company has typically maintained a conservative position and has historically generated substantial free cash flow from AWS and advertising to fund growth throughout the business.Managements record of investing in areas that investors were initially skeptical of but were ultimately vindicated has been remarkable. Jeff Bezos founded the company in 1994 and led it until he stepped down as CEO in 2021. He was succeeded by Andy Jassy, former CEO of AWS. Bezos remains actively involved with the company as executive chair of the board, and Jassy has been at the company for 23 years and was a driving force behind the foundation and growth of AWS. We think Jassy will carry on Bezos' focus on the customer and continue to explore areas that were ignored or not yet defined. Thus far, the results have been breathtaking. From humble beginnings, Bezos built Amazon into one of the largest companies in the world. On the e-commerce side, the company has evolved from selling books to selling everything, including groceries, delivering purchases the same day they are ordered, and moving into retail categories that were long thought to be beyond the reach of online shopping. The stickiness of Prime members, the financial stability of subscriptions, the tech world shakeup via AWS, the Kindlethe innovation has been dramatic, and shareholders have been rewarded along the way. Ultimately, we assess investment as exceptional. Amazons capital deployment strategy centers around reinvesting in the business and making generally small tuck-in acquisitions. The company does not pay a dividend or repurchase shares, nor do we expect it to over the next several years.","Amazon is a leading online retailer and one of the highest-grossing e-commerce aggregators, with $386 billion in net sales and approximately $578 billion in estimated physical/digital online gross merchandise volume in 2021. Retail-related revenue represents approximately 80% of the total, followed by Amazon Web Services' cloud computing, storage, database, and other offerings (10%-15%), advertising services (5%), and other. International segments constitute 25%-30% of Amazon's non-AWS sales, led by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.","We believe Amazon is financially sound. Revenue is growing rapidly, margins are expanding, the company has unrivaled scale, and the balance sheet is in great shape. In our view, the marketplace will remain attractive to third-party sellers, as Prime continues to tightly weave consumers to Amazon. We also see AWS and advertising driving overall corporate growth and continued margin expansion.As of Dec. 31, 2022, Amazon had $70.0 billion in cash and marketable securities, offset by $67.2 billion in debt. We also expect free cash flow generation, which suffered during COVID-19 as the company invested heavily in facility expansion, content creation, and its transportation network, to return to more normal levels over the next couple of years.Given that the company is still in a rapid growth and heavy investment phase, we do not expect it to pay dividends or repurchase shares. The company is acquisitive, but given its size, we characterize all acquisitions throughout its history as tuck-in, including the largest deal of $14 billion for Whole Foods in 2017 and the $8 billion MGM deal in 2022. We expect the focus to remain on growth, including heavy investment for AWS and delivery.",AMZN,Consumer Cyclical,1519510880256.0,NMS,39951833.0,USD,146.7100067138672,True,0,134.68788308536236,160.6881472740605,1
24/11/2023,Cisco Is Still the Pre-Eminent Force in Enterprise Networking and It Holds a Wide Moat,Cisco Systems Inc,CSCO,3,16/11/2023,William Kerwin,48.08,USD,23/11/2023,53.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,A,16/11/2023,"We trimmed our fair value estimate for wide-moat Cisco Systems to $53 per share, from $56 after the firm reported impressive fiscal first-quarter results but provided poor guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. Ciscos January-quarter guidance implies a 13% sequential sales decline, and management lowered their outlook for fiscal 2024 sales by roughly 5%. Management attributed the lowered expectations to large enterprises working to implement Cisco equipment previously delivered before resuming orders. We now see fiscal 2024 as more of a correction year. Tremendous fiscal 2023 results were driven by backlog reductions buoying sales above end demand that looks like it was weaker than wed previously believed. Zooming out, we continue to see a 3% medium-term growth rate as reasonable for Cisco and note that the midpoint of revised fiscal 2024 sales guidance still implies 3% compound annual growth from fiscal 2021, inclusive of a supernormal fiscal 2023 followed by the current correction. With shares down roughly 10% afterhours in reaction to guidance, we now see Cisco trading at a modest discount to our updated fair value estimate. We continue to like the companys moat, profitability, and shareholder returns for long-term investors, in spite of current weakness. Fiscal first-quarter sales rose 8% year over year to meet our expectations, and every profit metric exceeded our expectations. Networking sales drove top-line strength, rising 10% year over year. Impressive non-GAAP gross margin of 67% was helped by continued backlog reduction of high-margin products and filtered down through to the bottom line. January-quarter guidance includes $12.7 billion in sales at the midpoint, down 7% year over year and 13% sequentially. Cisco is also calling for more than 400 basis points of sequential non-GAAP operating margin compression to 32%, primarily behind weaker volumes.","Cisco holds dominant market shares across networking, and leading shares in areas like switching software and software-defined wide-area networking, or SD-WAN, bode well for its position in the next era. We view Ciscos shift toward a higher mix of software and subscription-based consumption models as positive. Ciscos balance sheet is strong and it generates impressive free cash flow. It is shareholder-friendly and sends most of its free cash flow back to shareholders.","Ciscos core markets of networking dont offer robust growth opportunities, and it has to seek top-line upside from nascent corners or other markets where it is less competitively advantaged. Cisco has been losing market share across networking and security over the last decade and will need to redouble its efforts against the likes of Arista Networks or cybersecurity platform providers. In high-speed, public cloud applications, Cisco lags Arista Networks in market share, which could hamper its growth as these applications grow in mix in the market.",16/11/2023,"We view Cisco Systems as the dominant force in enterprise networking and expect it to retain its strength in both legacy and future networks. Cisco holds leading market shares across switching, routing, and wireless access, with strong complementary positions in security and collaboration. We believe Ciscos portfolio is appropriately positioned to benefit from trends toward hybrid work and hybrid cloud environments. It offers the most comprehensive suite of capabilities across converging networking and security markets, and we deem its intertwined products as sticky and worthy of a wide economic moat. For years, the emergence of the public cloud has been interpreted as the demise of Cisco. Nevertheless, we credit Cisco for appropriately evolving its networking products from a campus focus to include strong software and high-speed public cloud capabilities. Though Cisco faces greater competition in new models of networking, we expect it to retain its leadership as enterprises adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments with new technologies like software-defined wide-area networking, or SD-WAN. We also positively view its shift toward a greater mix of software and subscription sales, which should increase its customer switching costs. We believe Ciscos core markets offer slow, but steady, growth with upside from newer software and cloud-centric businesses. We expect Cisco to continue investing both organically and inorganically to push the cutting edge of its markets and maintain growth. We also anticipate it to continue modestly raising its profit margins as it retains hefty pricing power in networking and pushes deeper into a software- and subscription-based model. In our view, Ciscos shareholder return policies are superb. The firm has a resolute balance sheet and generates immense cash flow. It dedicates well over half of this cash flow to its dividend and repurchases, which we view favorably. Ciscos dividend yield and total shareholder return, inclusive of buybacks, should be attractive to long-term investors. ","We assign Cisco Systems a wide economic moat rating stemming from customer switching costs. We think Ciscos offerings for networking and cybersecurity are comprehensive and intertwined, with integrated software, hardware, and services creating a sticky overall solution and leading to pricing power. These competitive advantages give us confidence in Cisco earning economic profits, more likely than not, over the next 20 years.Cisco is the dominant force in enterprise networking and the only provider we see with a complete end-to-end portfolio for both on-premises and the cloud. Ciscos switches, wireless access points, routers, and networking software allow enterprises to create local networks and give those local networks access to private clouds, public clouds, and the internet. Cisco holds the top market share position in nearly every subsection of the enterprise networking market, including campus and data center switching, networking software, routing, software-defined wide-area networking, or SD-WAN, and wireless access.Once Cisco is embedded in a business, we believe it becomes increasingly hard to rip Cisco out. Data center hardware refresh cycles happen a couple of times a decade. Campus refreshes can be even more spaced out. Upon each refresh, we believe that enterprises are more likely to stay with a well-performing incumbent networking vendor. Refreshing networking hardware is a headache regardless, but it is even more fraught when switching vendors. Refreshing hardware can lead to partial network and application downtime, and costs time, money, and effort on part of an IT department to ensure new hardware and software fit in seamlessly. When a business switches vendors, it has to transfer the whole network to a new architecture, including differently specified hardware and completely new software. This leads to longer and more costly implementation, at best. At worst, it risks losing critical data or functionality of portions of the network and applications.Cisco is building upon the existing stickiness of its networking equipment by integrating its software and hardware. In our view, software is just as critical as hardware to an enterprises networking needs, if not more so. Ciscos software gives IT departments a broad dashboard with visibility throughout the network. This can show malfunctioning hardware, show traffic between all endpoints, and even provide artificial-intelligence-powered suggestions to solve problems. Highly integrated software augments switching costs, given IT departments take time to develop workflows specific to their vendor. We believe Cisco solidifies its switching costs with an expansive ecosystem of technologist certifications and a large training pipeline. It offers close to 20 specialized certifications across four levels of expertise (novice to expert), with tens of thousands of learning partners globally. Cisco certifications are a bellwether for competence in the IT industry, and provide an added switching cost for firms using Cisco hardware. With Cisco being the large incumbent in networking, aspiring IT professionals seek out Cisco certifications to bolster a resume. For a hiring manager, IT professionals with Cisco certifications reduce onboarding friction, and switching vendors would require certifying the whole IT department on new standards.Cisco's switching costs provide it with pricing power for its networking products. Cisco customers readily pay a premium for its equipment, resulting in steady gross margins in the mid-60% range that are matched only by high-speed networking provider Arista Networks. As one example, China-based competitor Huawei actually ships the most 10-gigabit and 25-gigabit switches globally, but Ciscos revenue triples that of Huawei for these products. Cisco also offers a comprehensive platform for cybersecurity. Cisco is a strong incumbent vendor for network firewalls but has a rounded portfolio, including identity access management, cloud security, endpoint security, zero trust, and threat intelligence. We see cybersecurity software as eliciting switching costs, resulting from the depth by which it is embedded in enterprise networks. To change a cybersecurity vendor, a customer incurs the time and expense of getting up to speed on a new system, along with the expense of running both systems concurrently during the transition. Finally, the customer risks breaches during the vulnerable transition.Though we dont view Cisco as offering best-of-breed capabilities in any point solution for security (though it comes closest for firewalls), we view the ability to offer robust capabilities across the spectrum of security as a competitive advantage. We believe IT departments want to consolidate their cybersecurity vendor listssome reports estimate enterprises averaging close to 50 vendors. A high quantity of vendors can lead to overlapping capabilities and inundated IT departments that are less familiar with each individual vendor and less effective at resolving individual threats. We dont foresee any IT department locking itself into a single vendor, but the ability to consolidate a few functions with one strong vendor is attractive. This not only drives demand for Ciscos security platform but leads to stickier customers. The more points of Ciscos platform a customer uses, the more integrated it becomes in the organization, and it becomes even harder to replace. We see its budding observability portfolios (though not moaty in isolation) integration with its security platform as a further adhesive for customers.We believe that security and networking are converging, especially as multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments become the norm. Every network and connection needs to be secure. Cisco, as a pre-eminent provider of both, is in an advantaged position to win new customers and cross-sell within existing customers. Many of Ciscos sales feature a combination of networking hardware, networking software, and security software. We view a direct relationship between the number of products a customer adopts and Ciscos stickiness within that customer. It may be easier, more cost-efficient, and less risky for an existing Cisco customer pursuing a new security product to up its subscription rather than sourcing from a whole new vendor. It would also be difficult to replace a point offering from Cisco, given its integration with networking software and other security offerings.Finally, we see Ciscos services providing an additional layer of stickiness. Ciscos services range from basic troubleshooting to high-level optimization. Professional services can help to optimize the way an IT department builds and operates a network and offer improvements over the lifecycle of the equipment. Cisco also has a renowned cyber threat intelligence team, Talos, that feeds information on new and emerging threats into customer security products. These help to further embed Ciscos products into the workflows of a customer and make them harder to rip out.We think concerns over the public cloud for Cisco are overestimated. We do see Ciscos position in public cloud providers as weaker than in the rest of the market. Cisco trails Arista Networks in high-speed switching market share, and we believe hyperscalers offer lower switching costs to providers by consuming hardware, software, and chips in a disaggregated model. Still, we expect hybrid cloud environments to be the long-term favored option for enterprises, which should maintain demand for Ciscos campus and data center offerings. An average enterprise uses more than two public and two private clouds in its network, per Faction. Furthermore, we see these environments as being a boon for Ciscos SD-WAN and networking software offerings. We also note Cisco maintains a strong second-place market share in high-speed switching and sells its software and chips  la carte to public cloud providers.In our view, Ciscos collaboration segment, composed of its Webex suite for meetings as well as a unified communications as a service, or UCaaS, solution, also exhibits switching costs. Though we see steep competition with Zoom and Microsoft Teams, we view these three leaders as technologically neck-and-neck. Ciscos ability to service a customers telephony along with feature-rich meeting software and a suite of peripheral hardware (phones, headsets, desk hubs, conference room equipment) embeds it in a customers workflows. A customer using Ciscos meeting or UCaaS solution may find it easier to adopt the complementary solution rather than sourcing from a new vendor. A customer would also find it difficult to rip out either solution, given employee familiarity with hardware and software interfaces and the requisite transition period of utilizing two solutions.Ciscos sticky products embed themselves in customers and give the firm pricing power that leads to strong margins and returns on invested capital. Even against robust competition and a rapidly evolving technological landscape, Cisco has done well to gently expand its margins with software. We see the push toward subscription-based offerings as solidifying the firms stickiness. Even as competitive threats persist, we are confident in Ciscos ability to generate excess returns above its cost of capital, more likely than not, over the next 20 years.","We assign Cisco Systems a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Cisco can experience some mild cyclicality in customer IT spending and is under constant competitive threat across its broad portfolio. Weve seen high, concentrated investment from more focused competitors like Arista Networks or Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet lead to market share gains at Ciscos expense. In the face of such competition, Cisco commits steady organic investment into research and development and sales and marketing in order to compete on the cutting edge and maintain its sticky foothold in existing customers. In addition, Ciscos service provider customer base can offer lumpy spending habits, which could lead to some swings in sales and profits.We believe Cisco can face risk from its outsourced manufacturing model, which can augment supply constraints like the firm saw in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. Supply constraints can lead to lower sales in the short term, and if Cisco built up excess inventory to insure against short supply, it may have to discount it or write it down, hampering margins. Cisco is also a serial acquirer, and its acquisition strategy could pose a risk if the firm began to reach for overvalued assets or poor strategic fits that began to destroy shareholder value. Finally, we foresee modest environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk for Cisco. ESG risk in our view would primarily come via the risk of cyber breaches to its security equipment and software, which could cause serious customer harm and tarnish Ciscos reputation. We also see high human capital demand as making it difficult for Cisco to attract and retain top engineers.","We rate Cisco Systems capital allocation as Exemplary, primarily based on its excellent shareholder return program. Ciscos strong balance sheet gives it the flexibility for these returns, and we rate managements investments overall as fair. Overall, we see Cisco as adequately defending its competitive position while being extremely shareholder-friendly.Ciscos capital allocation priorities, in order, are organic investment, inorganic investment, maintaining its dividend, and buying back stock. Cisco maintains a large cash position and relatively low debt, with consistently robust annual free cash flow. It targets more than 50% of free cash flow to go back to shareholders. Even after significant organic investment, Cisco maintains a growing dividend at a high payout ratio and sends extra cash toward repurchases. Cisco has well exceeded its 50% target in the past, and we expect this to continue.We think Cisco has been prudent to keep its recent acquisitions on the smaller end, and they have gone toward adjacent markets or capabilities to help it defend against competition. We also see Ciscos balance sheet as accommodating for a larger deal if it were to prove attractive. We think Ciscos primary organic investments in research and development and sales and marketing help fortress its large existing install base and allow it to renew at customers with new, cutting-edge equipment.","Cisco Systems is the largest provider of networking equipment in the world and one of the largest software companies in the world. Its largest businesses are selling networking hardware and software (where it has leading market shares) and cybersecurity software like firewalls. It also has collaboration products, like its Webex suite, and observability tools. It primarily outsources its manufacturing to third parties and has a large sales and marketing staff25,000 strong across 90 countries. Overall, Cisco employees 80,000 employees and sells its products globally.","Cisco Systems has a strong balance sheet, in our view. We expect it to focus on free cash flow generation over the next five years, most of which we expect it to send back to shareholders. As of July 31, 2023, Cisco held a net cash position with $26.1 billion in cash and investments compared with $8.4 billion in gross debt. Cisco maintains its ample cash position with impressive free cash generationto the tune of $15 billion annually over the last five years. Cisco has converted more than 100% of its net income to free cash flow each of the past 10 years. We expect this to continue and forecast free cash flow to average $17 billion annually through fiscal 2028. After organic investment, Cisco focuses its cash on shareholder returns and M&A. We expect it to maintain and steadily grow its dividend, and achieve its target of more than 50% of free cash flow going back to shareholders using repurchases. Even after organic investment and shareholder returns, we view Ciscos balance sheet as being in a strong position to conduct strategic acquisitions. Though we expect it to maintain smaller deals going forward, we see room for a larger, more transformative deal if management found the right target. The firm could issue more debt and maintain an investment-grade rating, in our view. Finally, Cisco has a $3 billion revolving credit facility and $10 billion commercial paper program for short- and long-term liquidity needs.",CSCO,Technology,196956880896.0,NMS,18744694.0,USD,48.08000183105469,True,1,53.66294115851175,49.67370379412839,1
24/11/2023,Scotts Will Benefit From Strong Gardening Brands Driving Profit Restoration,The Scotts Miracle Gro Co,SMG,4,01/11/2023,Seth Goldstein,56.2,USD,23/11/2023,100.0,Very High,Narrow,Poor,C,01/11/2023,"Scotts Miracle Gros fiscal 2023 fourth quarter showed progress on the company's strategy to sell excess inventory and run its plants at lower capacity as a way to pay down debt. Having updated our model to incorporate the results, we maintain our $100 per share fair value estimate. Our narrow moat rating is also unchanged. Scotts' shares traded up nearly 21% at the time of writing on management's guidance for sales growth, double-digit operating margins, and further deleveraging. However, at current prices, we view Scotts shares as materially undervalued with the stock trading at a little less than half of our fair value estimate. Shares trade just below our downside scenario, which produces a fair value estimate of $55 per share. Our downside scenario assumes slow revenue growth and lower profit margins versus our base case, with profits remaining well below the peak in fiscal 2021. Accordingly, we think a lot of the bad news remains priced into the stock. The U.S. Consumer business declined nearly 3% year over year and 34% in the fourth quarter, in line with management guidance. We think the business should return to growth moving forward, as volumes grow after cost inflation likely led to some consumers reducing spending on gardening products. As prices and costs normalize, we expect U.S. consumer segment profits will rebound to the low- to mid-20% range, in line with prepandemic levels. In the Hawthorne segment, sales declined 35% and operating margins clocked in at negative 10% for the year. The oversupplied cannabis supplies segment continues to weigh on segment profitability. However, after Hawthorne cut costs, we expect the business to stabilize in fiscal 2024 and generate a small profit.","U.S. household formation growth will drive demand for gardening products. As the market leader in consumer gardening products, Scotts will benefit from the secular housing trend. Consumer behavior has changed following the COVID-19 pandemic, with more consumers engaging in gardening as an activity. As the largest player in the consumer gardening market, Scotts will benefit from this change through higher long-term volumes. The emerging cannabis industry represents a lucrative opportunity for Scotts, which is well positioned to capture this segment of the market.","While the recreational gardening industry is growing, consumers will increasingly prefer private label and generic products, reducing Scotts' market share over time. Scotts' Hawthorne segment will not be able to generate long-term operating margin expansion, as its cannabis-growing equipment will not command maintainable pricing power. Scotts' acquisition of hydroponics producers will be value-destructive if the cannabis industry does not expand as anticipated because of regulatory constraints.",01/11/2023,"Scotts Miracle-Gro is the largest and most recognizable name in the U.S. consumer lawn and gardening market. The firm sells a wide array of products used for lawncare and gardening. The U.S. consumer segment, which consists of lawn and gardening products, generated 80% of total revenue in fiscal 2023. Scotts has generated healthy margins on its products through effective branding, which allows it to maintain favorable product positioning and shelf space in the largest mass-market and home improvement retailers. Scotts has been able to charge a premium over competitors because of its strong brand equity. While actual product differentiation is limited, consumers have been willing to pay up for Scotts' products. Future demand for gardening products will depend on growth in the housing industry. We expect housing starts to average a little less than 1.5 million per year through 2030. While housing starts alone should increase demand for gardening products, we see some secular trends that will offset the growth. Living-preference shifts to smaller lots and urban centers should result in less need for gardening products. Additionally, a greater proportion of gardening products will be sold online. Currently, the vast majority of sales occur at brick-and-mortar retail. Even if Scotts increases its online sales presence, it may lose some pricing power as many products in the gardening industry shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers to online platforms, where Scotts will likely face more lower-priced competition. The Hawthorne segment, which includes indoor gardening, hydroponics, and lighting equipment, contributed a little under 15% of revenue in fiscal 2023. Its long-term growth is tied to the legalization of cannabis in the U.S., as its products are used by licensed growers. Scotts is conducting a review of the business and may ultimately pursue a divestiture. The remainder of revenue comes from lawn and gardening products sold outside the United States.  The majority of U.S. consumer sales come from Home Depot and Lowes, which combined to account for 43% of 2022 companywide revenue, which creates some customer concentration risk.","We assign a narrow economic moat rating to Scotts Miracle-Gro because of intangible assets from the company's portfolio of well-recognized brands. Based on our midcycle forecasts, the moaty U.S. consumer segment will account for around 90% of companywide profits, with the no-moat Hawthorne segment accounting for the balance. Regardless, we believe returns on invested capital for the Hawthorne segment will converge with the companys cost of capital over time while the U.S. consumer segment continues to deliver steady returns safely above Scotts cost of capital. As a result, we contend that Scotts will more likely than not generate economic profits on a companywide basis for at least the next 10 years.The companys flagship U.S. consumer segment operates as the largest player in the U.S. gardening industry with a market share greater than 50%. Key brands under the Scotts umbrella include Scotts, Miracle-Gro, Ortho, Tomcat, and Roundup. Scotts is able to charge materially higher prices than its competition because of brand recognition among customers. Additionally, Scotts branded products command considerable shelf space in the gardening sections of major retailers, including Home Depot, Lowes, and Walmart. These entrenched retail relationships further enhance the companys brand intangible asset. In support of its pricing power, Scotts has been able to raise prices 2%-3% nearly every year over the past decade. The company's strong pricing power allows it to pass along cost inflation, which has supported margin expansion, or margin recovery when costs rise. The ability to maintain premium pricing for its branded products has allowed Scotts to consistently generate healthy operating margins and earn returns on invested capital above its weighted average cost of capital.Although Scotts products are not highly differentiated from those of its competitors, the companys brand equity has created a perceived quality difference among consumers. For example, Scotts can charge an average of 50% more per pound for its Turf Builder grass fertilizer versus four of its competitors similar grass fertilizers. When comparing Miracle-Gros plant food with that of a competitor, the two have identical ingredients, yet Scotts charges a premium for its products. Scotts customer base skews toward affluent homeowners with larger lawns. Because lawncare and gardening are recreational activities, and the result (an attractive lawn) becomes a status symbol, many consumers are willing to pay a premium for a product they perceive to be more effective. Given the power of its brand equity, were confident that Scotts will continue to outearn its cost of capital over the next decade.The Hawthorne segment sells hydroponic growing equipment used primarily for cannabis cultivation to distributors in the U.S. or directly to cannabis growers in Canada. Through acquisitions, Scotts has established a first-mover advantage in this nascent industry and commands an estimated 40%-50% market share, depending on the product.However, we do not see a durable competitive advantage for this business, and we assign a no-moat rating to the segment. For companies in the cannabis equipment industry, intangible assets, cost advantage, and switching costs would be the most likely moat sources to apply. Although the intangible asset moat sources could be derived from product differentiation, patent protection, or brand strength, we essentially view cannabis cultivation equipment as commodities. Therefore, intangible assets do not apply to the Hawthorne segment. Further, we do not see brand recognition for Hawthorne's products supporting durable pricing power over competitors. Cost advantage could come from hard-to-replicate economies of scale. As the largest hydroponic equipment producer with the biggest distribution network, we see traces of scale-based cost advantage for Hawthorne. However, we have yet to see this result in higher profit margins, and we view the scale as replicable over the long run in this highly competitive market. Finally, switching costs could be achievable from a razor-and-blade model, whereby the company works with cannabis growers to set up an entire growing system that uses only Hawthorne products and, in turn, requires high-priced replacement parts that could be furnished only by Hawthorne. However, Hawthorne has yet to integrate all of its products in such a manner that would render a customer unable to easily switch to a competitor. Hawthorne's key products, such as light fixtures, tubes, and fans, come in standard sizes. This dynamic is unlikely to change as the company strives to capture additional market share. Therefore, although Hawthorne will drive healthy long-term profit growth for Scotts, a no-moat rating seems most appropriate for the segment.","We assign Scotts a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.Scotts faces customer concentration risk. Home Depot and Lowes constituted 43% of the companys total revenue in 2022, with Home Depot accounting for 28%. Scotts would be significantly affected if either of these retailers stopped carrying its products.Another risk for Scotts is regulatory uncertainty around cannabis legalization. The company has invested heavily in cannabis growing equipment used by licensed growers in U.S. states where the crop has been legalized. Currently, 23 states have legalized the use of high-THC cannabis for recreational use. Under U.S. federal law, cannabis is illegal. If the federal government decided to overrule state laws, the Hawthorne segments customer base of legal cannabis growers could disappear. If cannabis is legalized on a federal level, a greater proportion of cannabis could be grown outdoors, leaving little demand for Hawthorne's primarily-indoor growing equipment. Hawthorne may also face increased competition from traditional agricultural input producers.As an agriculture chemicals producer, Scotts faces environmental, social, and governance risks, mostly related to emissions and the environmental impact of its products. Emissions regulations would increase costs for Scotts, but it would likely be able to pass along cost increases. As such, we see a moderate probability but low materiality to the company. Regulations on its products, such as a ban on certain chemicals, represent a risk to Scotts, as it would have to reformulate products. We see a moderate probability and moderate impact from this risk.Further, the company faces risks related to Roundup, as Scotts markets it under an agreement with Bayer (Monsanto). Roundup is glyphosate-based and Bayer is facing numerous lawsuits over the commercial version of Roundup. While Scotts is indemnified from any legal liabilities, the headlines could turn consumers away from using the consumer version of Roundup.","We assign a Poor Morningstar capital allocation rating to Scotts Miracle-Gro based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.Scotts has a weak balance sheet. The company's leverage ratios are elevated and is likely to maintain elevated leverage over the next couple of years. However, Scotts' has few near-term debt maturities. The company also has moderate unleveraged business risk and cyclicality, which reduces the risk an economic downturn would materially affect results.We see management's investments as poor. We are in favor of management's investment in more environmentally friendly products, such as Ortho GroundClear and organic fertilizers, which should allow Scotts to maintain market share as consumers demand more environmentally friendly products.However, management's investment strategy in both the U.S. consumer business and Hawthorne has hurt shareholders. In general, we think management took a near-term focus, investing heavily at peak cyclical conditions instead of positioning the business for long-term success. As a result, we do not have confidence management's investment decisions will add long-term value to shareholders.The decision to invest in Hawthorne and enter the cannabis growing market largely through durables, such as growing equipment, has destroyed shareholder value. Hawthorne was built through a series of small acquisitions. We don't think management vastly overpaid for any single acquisition, which was a good move. However, the company did not have a clear consolidation strategy for its acquisitions. Scotts then invested heavily in building manufacturing and distribution capacity. As a result, the Hawthorne business is in the midst of seeing revenue decline nearly 70% from the peak and has become unprofitable when the cyclical durables business saw a downturn. Ultimately, this led management to shut down excess capacity and distribution facilities due to prolonged unprofitable conditions, leading to shareholder value destruction as Hawthorne is left with a smaller business, unwinding much of the previous growth investment.Instead, we would prefer management focus on consumables, as these products generally have higher profit margins. Additionally, consumables, such as specialty fertilizers, are more likely to see demand grow with the market as growers will need to purchases these products for every crop, leading to more stable results, similar to the consumables-focused U.S. consumer business.Additionally, we think management's decision to invest in the capacity expansion of its gardening business was shortsighted. In our view, the company responded to the near-term COVID-19-related demand growth for gardening that ultimately proved to be temporary. This investment combined with acquisitions in the Hawthorne business ultimately led to the company's strained balance sheet as debt rose just as profits peaked in fiscal 2021, leading Scotts to see sharp profit declines and negative free cash flow in fiscal 2022.Finally, we think distributions are appropriate. The company pays a stable dividend and uses excess cash flows to repay debt or for either share repurchases or special dividends. However, the additional shareholder distributions are typically prioritized after reinvesting in the business, which makes sense to us.Jim Hagedorn has been CEO since 2001. Before that, he was a senior vice president at Miracle-Gro and worked to integrate Miracle-Gro and Scotts when the two companies merged in 1995. Hagedorn is also board chair and the largest shareholder, owning over one fourth of total shares outstanding.Managements executive compensation is based on adjusted EBITA, adjusted free cash flow, and total investor return. While the total investor return metric aligns management with shareholders over a short-term period, we would prefer compensation metrics to include return on invested capital to encourage management to position the business for long-term success.","Scotts Miracle-Gro is the largest provider of gardening and lawncare products in the United States. The majority of the company's sales are to large retailers that include Home Depot, Lowe's, and Walmart. Scotts Miracle-Gro can sell its products at a higher price point than its competition because of a well-recognized portfolio of brands that include Miracle-Gro, Roundup, Ortho, Tomcat, and Scotts. Scotts is also the leading supplier of cannabis-growing equipment in North America through its Hawthorne business.","Scotts Miracle-Gro currently has elevated leverage. As of Sept. 30, the end of Scotts' 2023 fiscal year, management cited net debt/adjusted EBITDA of 6.57 times, well above management's long-term target leverage of 3.5 times. Additionally, management was forced to amend its existing credit agreements to allow for higher leverage ratios. The elevated leverage is a result of the company's decision to build up inventory and expand capacity in both the U.S. consumer and Hawthorne businesses in anticipation of higher volumes in fiscal 2022. However, both segments saw double-digit volume declines during the year, which sharply reduced EBITDA, straining the company's leverage ratios. As a result, Scotts has reduced overhead costs and is selling excess inventory. The company plans to use excess cash flow to repay debt. Further, as the U.S. consumer and Hawthorne businesses recover, we expect EBITDA growth will resume and leverage ratios will fall below 4.0 times by the end of fiscal 2024, in line with management's near-term goal.Over the last five years, dividends grew at an average mid-single-digit rate. Management has indicated that it intends to continue raising the dividend over time. Scotts plans to maintain the dividend while leverage ratios are high, but may need to temporarily cut it as a way to accelerate debt reduction. Additionally, if the company continues to face declining sales and elevated costs, Scotts may need to issue equity to restore its financial health.

24/11/2023,Pentair's Transformation Initiatives Continue to Drive Impressive Margin Expansion,Pentair PLC,PNR,4,25/10/2023,Krzysztof Smalec,63.22,USD,24/11/2023,70.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,25/10/2023,"We are maintaining our $70 fair value estimate for narrow-moat-rated Pentair after the company reported third-quarter results, as our slightly more muted near-term revenue growth projections were offset by the time value of money. Despite a 7% year-over-year core sales decline in the third quarter, we were encouraged by Pentairs 140-basis-point year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion, from 19.6% to 21%, driven by pricing, productivity, and margin accretion from the Manitowoc acquisition. Compared with the prior-year period, Pentairs third-quarter core sales were up 1% in industrial and flow technologies, flat in water solutions, and down 21% in pool. The latter had to contend with the ongoing inventory correction in the distribution channel and tough year-over-year comparisons, resulting in a 28% volume decline, partially offset by 7% higher pricing. We think that Pentairs transformation initiatives drove strong margin expansion across all three segments, especially given the revenue headwinds: 250 basis points in industrial and flow technologies, 510 basis points in water solutions, and 130 basis points in pool. Management raised the bottom end of its full-year guidance range by a nickel and now anticipates adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.75. Pentairs updated outlook now assumes in a high-teens sales decline in pool (slightly worse than the midteens decline baked into the previous outlook), but we continue to expect the segment to return to growth after channel inventory levels normalize by the end of 2023. We view the headwinds in pool as temporary, following strong growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the segments long-term prospects as we expect it to benefit from opportunities in pool automation and sustainable water solutions.","Pentair is a pure-play water company poised to benefit from demand for sustainable and energy-efficient water solutions. The pool business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, consistent market share gains, and lucrative operating margins. The acquisitions of Pelican Water and Aquion will bolster Pentairs portfolio of water solutions in the residential and commercial markets.",Growth has been relatively sluggish and may remain elusive in the industrial and flow technologies segment. Persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could make Pentair more susceptible to offshore competition. Cost inflation could be a headwind in the short run.,25/10/2023,"Pentair is a pure-play water company manufacturing a wide range of sustainable water solutions, including energy-efficient swimming pool pumps, filtration solutions, and commercial and industrial pumps. Pentairs business is organized into three segments: pool, water solutions, and industrial and flow technologies. The company benefits from a large installed base of equipment, and over 75% of its products are replacement.  In 2022, Pentair announced an agreement to acquire Manitowoc Ice from Welbilt for roughly $1.6 billion. Manitowoc Ice is a leading producer of commercial ice makers, with roughly 50% market share of cubed ice machines sold in the U.S. From a strategic perspective, we believe that the acquisition will complement Pentairs existing commercial water solutions portfolio and bolster its presence in the foodservice industry. For full-year 2023, management anticipates sales to be down 1% from the prior year. The guidance assumes a high-teens revenue decline in pool, a high-teens revenue increase in water solutions (driven by contribution from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition), and a mid-single-digit revenue increase in industrial and flow technologies. Although Pentairs 2023 pool volumes will be pressured by the inventory correction in the residential channel, we expect the company to return to more normalized growth in 2024. In the long run, we expect Pentair to grow its revenue at a mid-single-digit clip, fueled by opportunities in pool and water solutions. Furthermore, we are encouraged by Pentairs margin expansion since the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. The company has raised its long-term operating margin target by 100 basis points to 23% by 2025, driven by transformation initiatives, cost efficiencies, and the accretive Manitowoc Ice acquisition.","We believe that water treatment company Pentair has developed a narrow moat attributable to customer switching costs and intangible assets. Pentair derives roughly two thirds of its revenue from aftermarket service and replacement parts, which are largely tied to its large installed base. Because many of the companys products (including pumps, filters, and control valves) perform mission-critical functions, any product failures could lead to costly outages for customers. Thus, quality and reliability are paramount, and customers seldom pursue cost savings by switching to cheaper alternatives, which leads to a loyal customer base. We believe the company is well positioned to earn excess economic profits over the next decade thanks to its narrow moat.We believe the pool segment has carved a wide moat, which allows it to generate lucrative mid-20s operating margins. The segment benefits from a large installed base, as roughly 85% of sales come from aftermarket service and repairs. Customer switching costs and intangible assets help Pentair protect the moat surrounding its large installed base. Not only do robust aftermarket sales make revenue less cyclical, they also reduce Pentairs reliance on new construction starts, as the bulk of revenue is derived from the large existing market of over 5 million swimming pools in the U.S.The company revolutionized the swimming pool pump industry when it introduced its IntelliFlo variable-speed pump in 2006. Variable-speed pumps can cut electricity consumption by up to 90%, significantly reducing customers' utility bills. Adoption of variable-speed pumps has been accelerated by a Department of Energy regulation, effective July 19, 2021, establishing minimum energy efficiency of swimming pool pumps. Pentair has seen solid demand for its variable-speed pumps in recent quarters and said in a recent presentation that roughly 60% of pumps it currently sells are variable-speed. While some single-speed models will be compliant in certain applications (such as spas and smaller pools), Pentair's management believes that the variable-speed pump penetration rate could reach roughly 80%-85% by 2022, which leaves room for further growth from current levels. This is a tailwind for Pentair's revenue growth as variable-speed pumps can be 2-2.5 times more expensive than single-speed pumps.Another example of Pentairs innovation is IntelliConnect, a pool automation system that won the Best New Product award at the 2018 International Pool Spa Patio Expo. The system connects multiple pool devices (such as pumps and filters) and allows owners to remotely monitor and control their pools (including lighting, variable speed pumps, and so on) from a smartphone app. We think IntelliConnect has the potential to be another revolutionary product.We believe that Pentair is well positioned to continue increasing the value of its content per pool pad by offering automation solutions, energy-efficient products, and software-enabled devices. Furthermore, we think that connected solutions have the potential to reinforce switching costs in the pool business as we believe that offering an ecosystem that integrates multiple Pentair products and allows customers to remotely monitor and control their pools will enhance customer loyalty.We think water solutions garners a narrow moat primarily due to switching costs. This segment sells products that are critical for its customers operations. As such, a reputation for quality and reliability is decisive, especially in the commercial and industrial verticals, as any product failures could lead to costly outages or downtime. For example, filtration systems are critical for breweries, coffee shops, and commercial fish farms. Customers in these end markets are unlikely to aggressively pursue cost savings by switching to a cheaper alternative, as the cost of outages could outweigh any potential cost savings. As such, customers tend to be loyal, and roughly half of the segments revenue is aftermarket-based. Pentairs moat in water solutions is bolstered by intangible assets. For instance, one of its brands, Everpure, has strong brand equity as a leader in the food and beverage industry, serving well-known companies such as Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and United Airlines. Additionally, Pentair has a strong network of affiliated dealers, which we think will help drive demand in the long term.Finally, the industrial and flow technologies segment benefits from similar dynamics to those in the water solutions business, as reliability is important for customers. This segment also has a large installed base, as roughly 75% of sales are derived from aftermarket services and equipment replacement. While industrial and flow technologies is growing at a slower rate than pool and water solutions, the segment consistently earns operating margins in the midteens, which we think merits a narrow moat.","Pentair has a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium as the company exhibits an average degree of cyclicality. Pentairs risk is somewhat mitigated by its strong brand portfolio and large installed base. A significant portion of the companys revenue is driven by aftermarket sales and replacement parts. For example, the pool business derives roughly 80% of its sales from aftermarket service and replacement parts. As such, the bulk of the segments sales is attributable to over 5 million existing swimming pools in the U.S.; Pentair does not rely solely on new construction starts to increase its revenue in the segment.Significant cost inflation and persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could put a dent in Pentairs profitability. The company recently raised prices across all three business segments to help mitigate the impact of cost inflation. Nonetheless, rising commodity prices, coupled with a strong U.S. dollar, could erode Pentairs margins.Our Medium Uncertainty Rating is not materially affected by environmental, social, and governance risks. We think the largest and potentially most material ESG risks for the company include potential product quality and safety failures and failure to comply with various environmental as well as health and safety laws.","We assign Pentair a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment of the companys balance sheet, managements investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We think that Pentair has a sound balance sheet and that debt maturities are well spread out. We see management's investment history as fair, and we have no reason to expect future investments to be either materially value-accretive or -destructive. Lastly, we think that Pentair's shareholder distributions are appropriate.After serving as CFO for a decade, John Stauch took the helm in 2018, when the company spun off its electrical business as nVent and former CEO Randall Hogan retired. Stauch worked closely with Hogan during a period of heightened M&A activity and played a key role in rightsizing and restructuring acquired businesses. We believe that Pentair will continue to deliver solid margins under his leadership.Management indicated that it will focus on increasing revenue in pool, water solutions, and emerging markets. We expect Pentair to continue pursuing bolt-on and tuck-in M&A opportunities, primarily in the pool and water solutions segments.As far as capital allocation is concerned, management said it will prioritize investments that help expand its core business. Management has also committed to paying a competitive dividend, which we project to keep increasing roughly in line with earnings. In December 2022, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 5%, from $0.21 to $0.22, extending its dividend growth streak to 47 consecutive years. We also expect that management will continue to evaluate opportunistic share-buyback opportunities.","Pentair is a global leader in the water treatment industry, with 10,000 employees and a presence in 25 countries. Pentair's business is organized into two segments: consumer solutions and industrial and flow technologies. The company offers a wide range of water solutions, including energy-efficient swimming pool equipment, filtration solutions, and commercial and industrial pumps. Pentair generated approximately $4.1 billion in revenue and $768 million in adjusted operating income in 2022.","We think that Pentair is on solid financial footing. The company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $2.3 billion of long-term debt while holding $109 million in cash and equivalents. Debt maturities are reasonably well laddered, with no debt maturing in 2023 and only about $200 million maturing in 2024.The company is bound by a debt/EBITDA covenant that requires that the ratio not exceed 3.75 times. We believe that Pentair is in compliance with all relevant covenants, and we estimate it will have a debt/EBITDA ratio of roughly 2.7 times in 2023.",PNR,Industrials,10956017664.0,NYQ,1043144.0,USD,63.220001220703125,True,1,65.24647068697412,73.14951245377561,1

While Lyfts network effect has brought back some of those riders, we do not see this impacting the market share dynamics between the firm and the market leader, Uber. The path to quarterly profitability for Lyft improved during the quarter as prudent spending and reductions in R&D and general and administrative costs significantly lowered operating losses from last year. While we dont think the firm will hit GAAP profitability until 2027, continued expansion of the platforms network effect should help on the top and bottom lines going forward. We are maintaining our $25 fair value estimate. Net revenue came in at $1.16 billion, up 10% from last year, driven by 10% rider growth and stable revenue per rider (down only 0.40%) on an increase in rides taken (up 20%). Contribution margin declined over 2 percentage points year over year to 45% due to higher insurance costs. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $91 million (8% margin), compared with negative adjusted EBITDA of $27 million last year. In the fourth quarter, management expects gross bookings of $3.6 billion-$3.7 billion, a 14% increase at the midpoint as growth in rides taken continues to accelerate. Lyft also guided for fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA between $50 million and $60 million (1.5% margin as a percentage of gross bookings at the midpoint). On a net revenue basis, management forecast low- to mid-single-digit year-over-year growth that we estimate implies a 33% take rate compared with last years 37%.","Lyfts position in the autonomous vehicle race could equalize gross and net revenue, if it no longer needs to pay drivers. Lyft will profit from its do-good brand in comparison with competitor Uber. The company's aggregation of multimodal offerings will drive in-app stickiness, making Lyft a one-stop shop for all transport needs.","The development of autonomous vehicles, especially Googles Waymo, could eliminate the need for all existing ride-sharing platforms, driving Uber and Lyft out of business. Ride-sharing is still a relatively new industry, which leaves plenty of room for increasing regulations that could hurt Lyfts margins. Lyft may lose on pricing power if competitors with larger markets use profits from its monopolistic regions to drive down prices in the U.S. and Canada.",09/11/2023,"In the U.S. market, Lyft has quickly emerged as the number two ride-sharing player, a position we think the firm will keep for years to come. It has successfully gained share going head to head against the market leader, Uber, in pursuing riders in an addressable market (including taxis, ride-sharing, bikes, and scooters) that we value at over $670 billion (based on gross revenue) by 2027, from our estimate of over $430 billion in 2022. In our view, Lyft warrants a narrow economic moat and a stable moat trend rating, thanks to the network effect around its ride-sharing platform and intangible assets associated with riders, rides, and mapping data, which we think can drive Lyft to profitability and excess returns on invested capital. From a strategic standpoint, Lyft is well on its way to becoming a one-stop shop for on-demand transportation. It has tapped into the bike- and scooter-sharing markets, which we think will be worth over $12 billion by 2029, growing 7% annually. Lyft also appears to be aggressively pursuing the autonomous vehicle route as it understands that self-driving cars may help the firm to expand its margins; without drivers, it could recognize a bigger chunk of the fare as net revenue. In contrast to Uber, Lyft is not focused on food transportation or logistics. We like Lyft's relatively narrower focus on consumer transportation but note that Uber has an edge over Lyft in terms of an earlier start, higher market share, and a stronger network effect around its services. In addition, unlike Uber, Lyfts lack of revenue diversification wont soften the impact of exogenous shocks like COVID-19.  We believe Lyft may need to acquire riders more aggressively via lower pricing. However, we don't think this is a death knell for future profitability. Compared with Uber, Lyft has fewer riders on its platform and fewer rides taken because it is focusing mainly on the U.S. market; however, it may be able to avoid some bumps on the road toward GAAP profitability, including the international regulatory-related ones that may require additional costs. We foresee the firm becoming profitable in 2025. ","We believe Lyft warrants a narrow economic moat rating, stemming from two main moat sources. First, as with many other platforms that connect various parties (including narrow-moat Uber), we believe the company benefits from network effects between drivers and riders. Second, we believe Lyft has accumulated valuable intangible assets around driver and rider data that will be hard for startups and newcomers in the ride-sharing space to replicate. Ultimately, we believe these moat sources will help lift the company to profitability and allow it to generate excess returns on invested capital in the future. In our view, Lyfts network effects benefit drivers and riders; the benefits for each create a virtuous cycle. Drivers and riders make up the supply and demand in ride-sharing, respectively. As an early mover in this market, where requests for rides from anywhere could be made in real-time via a simple-to-use mobile app, Lyft began to attract riders mainly via word of mouth and other marketing channels, which also helped its rival, Uber. Growth in demand and further word-of-mouth marketing attracted more drivers or, in other words, increased the supply of Lyft vehicles. As the number of drivers increased, the timeliness and reliability of the service improved, which drove the number of riders and rides higher, which in turn attracted more drivers, all of which we believe is indicative of the direct network effect. Lyft was able to accelerate this network effect by focusing on smaller areas, such as San Francisco, before expanding into more and more cities. A comparable tech leader that profits from network effects is Facebook, whose first market was Harvard before it expanded to all colleges and then opened up globally. Lyft currently only services the U.S. and Canada. Companies that build network effects often must overcome the chicken-and-egg problem--in Lyft's case, who would drive for Lyft if there were no riders, or who would try to catch a ride with Lyft if there were no drivers. In ride-sharing, and perhaps in bike- and scooter-sharing, we think firms can overcome this problem by focusing on smaller geographic locations before branching out domestically and/or globally. Lyft's initial focus on San Francisco enabled it to gain the critical mass needed to have enough riders to ultimately attract drivers in other cities and regions. We think Lyft's U.S. and Canadian strength may help it expand into international markets in the long term as Lyft's success in North America (and a solid U.S. and Canadian rider base) may help it attract more drivers in new locations than competing startups. Experience attained from launching initially in and focusing more on the North American market may help Lyft more effectively allocate capital to its possible launches in other markets. In the meantime, Lyfts network effect moat source is evident in the firms growth of riders. Lyfts number of riders has increased since 2016, driven mainly by increased adoption of overall ride-sharing services plus Lyfts gradual expansion in other markets mainly in the U.S. After declining in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the firms number of active riders (defined as riders that take at least one ride per quarter) increased to more than 20 million in 2022. In first quarter 2016, the firm had only 3.5 million riders. In our view, Lyft is also likely to increase the use of its platform by consumers as it provides additional options such as last-mile offerings (bike- and scooter-sharing). In the long run, consumers may begin to rely more heavily on Lyfts platform to manage their transportation requirements. The same can be said of organizations or companies. For example, Lyft Business is working more closely with enterprises to provide transportation for employees and/or clients of the enterprises. As Lyft benefits from its network effect, we think the company has also secured access to valuable intangible assets in the form of driver and rider user data, which we suspect helps the firm improve its services. Such data should help to improve the capacity utilization of drivers, in turn making it more attractive for drivers to keep driving for Lyft. For riders, Lyft's knowledge of supply and demand may help the firm resolve any imbalances that might otherwise force riders into using an alternative transportation service. Additionally, and holistically, Lyfts service may become more effective over time as the company further monetizes its riders via real-time supply and demand-driven pricing. Lyft gathers data about riders and drivers. As the firm compiles data from the rider app about the locations to which users request riders, the times of the day that they do so, and the areas from which they request trips, it can get a clearer picture of its users tendencies. When combined with the user-generated driver ratings, we think such information helps Lyft improve the timeliness and accuracy of matching riders with drivers. With a more efficient service, Lyft will likely attract even more riders and drivers to the network over time, in turn strengthening its network effect. Data is the valuable byproduct and contributor to an indirect network effect moat source. Lyft also collects telematics, which can monitor car movements and location along with driver tendencies. The firm continues to analyze such data to minimize the chances of crashes by addressing or preventing unsafe driving. Such usage of data will help reduce Lyfts insurance-related costs. We do not view Lyfts brand as an intangible asset moat source. While the brand may have benefited from issues that competitor Uber faced regarding its cofounder and former CEO, we dont think this remains a long-term competitive advantage for Lyft. After all, while many no longer say they ""called a cab,"" people are more likely to say they ""called an Uber"" rather than Lyft, at least for now.We do not believe that Lyft benefits from additional moat sources such as switching costs or cost advantages. Lyft users can easily download other apps such as Uber and request rides. In addition, drivers can provide service for both Uber and Lyft, as they are not exclusive contractors. Lastly, while the development of Lyfts platform included very high fixed costs initially, we do not view it as a cost advantage for Lyft, as other well-capitalized firms in the technology space, such as Alphabet, could replicate what Lyft has created. In addition, we view Lyft as an asset-light business, although that may change a bit as the firm begins to focus on micromobility options such as bike-sharing and scooters.","We assign Lyft a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. First, Lyft faces intense competition in the U.S. from the ride-sharing leader, Uber, and it remains possible that Uber outspends or out-innovates Lyft in order to emerge as a winner-take-all (or most) ride-sharing provider. Further, there are certain concerns about whether Lyfts network effect can remain an economic moat source if the firm is forced to incur additional costs imposed through regulations at the municipal, state, and/or federal levels. For example, Lyft may be forced to conduct more thorough background checks on all driver applicants, such as adding costlier fingerprinting to the driver application process everywhere in the U.S., although the firm already conducts an annual background check on all its drivers. Such concern can also be viewed as an ESG risk related to human capital as a lack of enough background checks may put riders at risk and lessen the quality of Lyfts services. At the same time, more driver and rider data gathering may increase the data privacy and security ESG risk for the firm. Other regulatory issues may also serve to inhibit Lyfts network effect benefits. Concerns include whether Lyft will have to pay a minimum amount to each driver per trip in every state in which it operates. While the firm may have to concede and implement such policies, it will also likely take an overall higher percentage from the gross revenue generated per ride, as its price is likely to remain competitive with Ubers. Lack of enough compensation and/or benefits is also a human capital ESG risk, in our view, that can lead to drivers jumping to other platforms and reversing Lyfts network effect. We note that both dominating firms, Lyft and Uber, are likely to demand higher take rates.Last, there is the risk of larger technology companies such as Alphabets Waymo, or car companies such as General Motors Cruise, aggressively pursuing the growing ride-sharing market.","We assess the Capital Allocation of Lyft as Standard. The balance sheet remains sound with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only $803 million in debt. The leverage ratios continue to improve as Lyft further progresses toward profitability. While we consider the firms revenue cyclicality medium, risks to profitability are low given the platforms network effect moat source and mainly fixed costs. On the investment front, we remain pleased with the firms efforts to enhance its non-ridehailing offerings in order to expand its ecosystem and possibly make its platform stickier. Lyft has entered new businesses, like bike- and scooter-share with purpose, as these areas could do significant harm if Lyft chose not to enter. While Lyft has had hefty sales and marketing expenses, we believe this is necessary given the companys need to expand its network early on to later drive an organic network effect. However, we do not expect those investments to develop a switching cost moat source. On the distribution front, we do not foresee any dividend distribution or significant share buyback as the firm continues to allocate capital for growth which we think we help generate operating leverage and make the firm profitable. Logan Green is Lyfts CEO and cofounder. Green, along with president and vice chairman John Zimmer, founded Zimride in 2007, a mobility company that matched users with carpooling rides, starting with college students. Zimride pivoted and reincorporated as Lyft in 2013.Lyfts dual-class share structure limits the voice of other shareholders. Green and Zimmer have significant influence over Lyft, as they maintained their combined nearly 49% of voting power after the firms IPO in March 2019. Ultimately, investors will be dependent on the decisions made by Green and Zimmer and whether they will help Lyft generate exceptional returns for shareholders.","Lyft is the second-largest ride-sharing service provider in the U.S. and Canada, connecting riders and drivers over the Lyft app. Incorporated in 2013, Lyft offers a variety of rides via private vehicles, including traditional private rides, shared rides, and luxury ones. Besides ride-share, Lyft also has entered the bike- and scooter-share market to bring multimodal transportation options to users.","At the end of 2022, Lyft had $994 million in net cash on its balance sheet. It burned $237 million in cash from operations in 2022, more than the $102 million in 2021, mainly due to higher insurance costs. We expect the firm to generate cash from operations beginning in 2023. By 2032, we estimate Lyfts cash from operations to approach over $3 billion, outpacing top-line growth due to operating leverage. We expect Lyft to become free cash flow positive in 2023, after which it will average free cash flow to equity/sales of 12% through 2032. While we expect Lyft's FCFE/sales to reach 22% by 2032, we do not foresee the firm issuing dividends for the foreseeable future.",LYFT,Technology,5163889152.0,NMS,32275623.0,USD,10.289999961853027,True,1,10.76094120250353,14.566049375641976,1
24/11/2023,Changing Western Union's Moat Rating to Narrow From Wide,The Western Union Co,WU,5,25/10/2023,Brett Horn,12.06,USD,24/11/2023,17.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,C,25/10/2023,"Overall, we see Western Union's third-quarter results as encouraging. While the company still has a way to go to get fully back on its feet, recent trends suggest that the company is headed in the right direction. We will maintain our $17 per share fair value estimate for the narrow-moat firm and see shares as undervalued right now. Overall revenue grew 1% year over year, or 7% excluding currency impacts and divestitures, during the third quarter. High levels of inflation in Argentina boosted revenue growth by about 3 percentage points. The company also continues to benefit from regulatory changes in Iraq, a tailwind we think is not likely to persist past this quarter. Still, stripping out the noise, the company appears to be moving toward stability. The money transfer business saw 4% year-over-year growth, or 3% on a constant currency basis, as the quarter continued to benefit from a spike in revenue in Iraq. However, even excluding Iraq, cash-based transactions were flat year over year, following declines over the past few years. We are encouraged by this improvement. Branded digital transfers saw transactions grow 12% year over year, in line with the rate in the previous quarter. However, revenue grew just 3%, and the gap between revenue and transaction growth narrowed materially, suggesting growth is becoming less dependent on pricing decreases. We continue to see digital volumes as critical to maintaining the companys scale-based moat, given the industry shift in this direction. As for profitability, margins remain under pressure, with adjusted operating margins declining to 19.6% from 20.6% last year. We think the previous management team was overly focused on maintaining near-term margins at the expense of the company's long-term results. We are pleased to see the firm now taking a different tack. In the long run, we think maintaining overall share is the most important consideration.","The demographic factor that has historically driven money transfer growthnamely, the differential between population growth in developing and developed countriesremains in place for the foreseeable future. Western Union didn't see a major dropoff during the last recession or the pandemic, highlighting the stability of the business. While the motives for immigrants to relocate to wealthier countries are well understood, developed countries also have incentives to open their borders, as negligible native population growth makes immigration a necessity for long-term GDP growth.","A stricter stance on immigration in developed countries could limit immigrant populations and reduce their employment opportunities and money transfer volume. Alternative channels for sending money, such as cellphones, could cut out money transfer companies like Western Union. Weak macro conditions, a stronger dollar, and operational missteps have kept Western Union's growth low since the financial crisis, and there is no clear path to higher growth.",15/06/2023,"Western Union's primary macroeconomic exposure is to employment markets in the developed world, as the search for better economic opportunities is the fundamental driver for money transfers. While conditions have improved over time in the United States and Europe, a region that is about equally important for Western Union as the U.S., growth remains modest, with new entrants adding to the issues for legacy operators like Western Union. At this point, we don't see a long-term catalyst to meaningfully improve growth, with management focused on just stabilizing the business in the near term. Recent geopolitical events have been an additional headwind as the company made the decision to exit Russia, a significant money transfer market. We continue to believe Western Union has a moat based on its sizable scale advantage, but with a stagnant top line, the value of the moat going forward could be questioned. Another major issue for Western Union is the ongoing shift toward electronic methods of money transfer. The company has been actively building out its presence in electronic channels in recent years to adapt to the change in the industry. Western Union saw a sharp spike in digital transfers at the beginning of the pandemic. Western Union achieved a 32% year-over-year increase in transaction growth in 2021 as this area of the company's business jumped to about a quarter of revenue. More recently, results took a sharp negative turn, and management is attempting to get this side of the business back on track with investments in its platform and pricing actions.  We believe an aggressive approach is the best strategy, as Western Union positions itself to maintain its scale advantage despite the shift. In our view, scale and market share across all channels will be the dominant factor in long-term competitive position, and Western Union appears to be maintaining its overall position. However, the growth that the company is seeing in digital transfers has not led to strong overall growth historically, and we don't expect this situation to change.","Western Union is the largest player, by far, in an industry where size confers significant benefits. We see three potential advantages arising from the companys size. First, we think Western Union has historically been able to maintain premium pricing in some corridors, resulting in an intangible asset advantage. Second, we think the companys size has allowed it to pay relatively low commission rates to agents, as it could offer relatively high volumes as an offset, creating something of a network effect. Finally, we think the scalable nature of the business creates a cost advantage for an industry leader like Western Union. We think the first two competitive advantages (premium pricing and lower agent commissions) have eroded to a point where they no longer meaningfully contribute to the companys economic moat. However, we think Western Unions scale advantagewhich, in our view, has always been the primary moat driverremains in place. As result, we are lowering our moat rating from wide to narrow.The money transfer business is highly scalable because the incremental costs of processing additional transactions are minimal. Agent commissions (about 35% of revenue) are variable, but beyond commissions we believe most costs for money transfer operators are fixed. Western Union generates almost three times as much revenue as its closest competitor, giving it a marked cost advantage over its rivals, and its operating margins historically have been significantly higher than its peers. We think the company's scale advantage has always been the most significant driver of its economic moat. We believe a relatively large agent network has allowed Western Union to maintain something of a stranglehold on premium locations in certain corridors, and that the company has been able to maintain high prices in locations where it enjoyed an effective monopoly on convenient locations. With money transfers typically being sent to and from the same locations repeatedly, we believe customers are willing to pay a premium if one company offers convenient locations that cant be matched by competitors.However, agent counts have narrowed dramatically over time, and Euronet, in particular, has been successful in replicating the size of Western Unions agent network over time. Agent counts can be misleading, however, as not all agents are equal, and some are of no real value. Western Union notes that only about two-thirds of its agent locations generated a transaction in 2022. The quality of Western Unions network still appears to be much better than peers and Western Unions revenue per agent location is still more than twice its competitors. Further, the companys agent network remains stable, with its top 40 agents (which generate almost 60% of its revenue) having been with Western Union for over 20 years, on average. But we think it takes only a modest leveling in agent networks to meaningfully lower Western Unions ability to generate premium pricing. After all, if the company is able to maintain high fees because there are no other convenient options, it takes only one other convenient agent location to disrupt this situation. The impact can be seen clearly in the relative pricing pressure between Western Union and Euronet. Modest but ongoing price decreases have been typical in the industry for a long time. But over the last 10 years, Western Union has seen revenue per transaction decline at a 2.5% CAGR, compared with a decline of only 0.8% per year on average for Euronet over the same period.The agents on both sides of cash-based transaction receive commissions, and the send agent generally is paid a larger fee than the receive agent. The mix of cash and digital transactions can influence this percentage, as digital transactions typically dont have a send agent involved. Historically, we believe Western Union has been able to pay agents lower commission rates as its larger network allowed the company to offset the lower commission rate with higher volumes. For agents, this was attractive, as commissions for some agents are a secondary consideration, with driving more traffic into the agents store as the first priority. We think this advantage for Western Union was always fairly slight, as commission rates in the industry are fairly standardized and it was difficult for the company to justify a move too far away from industry norms. However, at this point, we dont know that there is any appreciable advantage for Western Union in terms of commission rates. Its gross margin, while roughly in line with peers, is at the low end of the group. While other costs are included in cost of goods sold and classifications across the three might not be perfectly consistent, it is difficult to believe Western Union has a meaningful advantage in commission rates based on its relative gross margin.An additional issue for Western Union in recent years has been the industry shift toward digital transfers. In our view, the competitive dynamics of digital transfers remain consistent with cash-based transfers, with size and the resulting cost differential being the primary consideration. Therefore, we see maintaining overall share across all channels as the primary factor in reinforcing Western Unions moat. As such, we believe that Western Union has responded appropriately to this shift, having invested relatively aggressively to build out its presence in digital channels. Western Union generated 22% of its revenue from branded digital transfers in 2022 and we believe the company (in terms of revenue) is the largest digital money transfer operator, although its lead in this space is not nearly as wide as in cash-based transfers. We also see the companys physical agent network as an advantage in digital transfers, given that we believe most digital transfers, while digital on the send side, remain cash-based on the receiving end. Western Union estimates that 70% of its digital transactions are cash-out on the receive side, and even digital-focused players such as Remitly and Xoom maintain physical receive agent networks. Money transfers typically flow from developed to developing economies, and most developing economies remain primarily cash-based.However, more recently, Western Unions digital revenue has declined, and the company is increasing spending on ancillary services such as digital wallets and digital banking to build out a more holistic service and lure customers back. These moves suggest the digital side of the business potentially should be viewed in the wider context of person-to-person payments, an area populated with significantly larger competitors. We think cross-border money transfers are very difficult to service given varied but generally heavy regulatory requirements around the globe, and PayPals lack of success with its Xoom acquisition implies that even large payment companies may struggle to build out truly global money transfer offerings. Still, we think the uncertainty around this industry evolution is further support for lowering Western Unions moat rating to narrow. ","We view political and regulatory event risk as a key consideration for the company, and history shows how compliance issues can have a dramatic impact on profitability for Western Union and peers. Regulators closely monitor money transfer businesses. Any violations at Western Union or its agents could have serious consequences, and the company recently paid a substantial fine. We see this type of issue as the company's largest environmental, social, and governance risk. Additionally, any changes in immigration laws that make it more difficult for foreigners to enter the U.S. or other countries could reduce money transfer volume. Immigration remains a hot-button issue politically, and regulators' attitude and actions could shift depending on which political party is in charge. Given that Western Union's model centers on immigrants sending money back home and out of the U.S. economy, we believed the previous administrations nativist views were in direct opposition to Western Unions business model on multiple fronts. However, we think the risk of adverse regulatory action has now been reduced. Additionally, alternative remittance channels could cut into the company's market share longer term. A weak global employment market could also prompt potential money transfer customers to stay in their home countries or reduce the amount of money they can send home. And finally, Western Union generates most of its revenue outside the U.S., creating meaningful currency risk that can act as a headwind if the dollar strengthens.Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is Medium.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Western Union is Standard. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.While Western Union's performance in recent years has been relatively weak, we think management has done enough to earn a Standard stewardship rating. Hikmet Ersek held the CEO role since 2010. For the most part, we believe his strategy was sound, but that execution has been lacking at certain points. Ersek retired at the end of 2021 and was replaced by Devin McGranahan, who comes to Western Union from Fiserv, where he headed the global business solutions segment. We like that Western Union is bringing in a CEO from the world of electronic payments, as we see building out its digital transfer presence as critical to maintaining the company's wide economic moat over time. McGranahan's comments suggest digital channels and looking for new avenues to monetize the company's global network will be his key areas of focus when it comes to improving growth. We see no major issues with his approach, but are also skeptical the company can materially lift growth in the long run.We like that the company has returned the lion's share of its free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchases and has increased its dividend significantly in recent years, given the limited reinvestment needs of the business. However, while we like that the company is looking for ways to further monetize its global network, acquisitions made to build out the business-to-business segment were at steep prices, and the performance of these businesses after acquisition has not been good. The goodwill impairment charge of almost $500 million in 2017 seemed like a final admission that these deals were value-destructive. More recent moves to sell some noncore operations suggest management may be more disciplined in its focus. Most critically, we think management has moved aggressively to build up the company's capabilities in electronic channels, and this has positioned Western Union to maintain its moat in the face of this industry shift. As a result, the company was in a good position to benefit from the pandemic-driven shift toward digital transfers. In 2019, Western Union sold Speedway, its domestic bill payment business, to ACI for $750 million. The deal for Speedway seemed reasonable, representing 8.3 times operating income for a low-growth business.In August 2021, the company announced it had reached an agreement to sell its business solutions segment to Goldfinch Partners and Baupost Group for $910 million. Western Union built this business through acquisitions, and we dont believe the expected synergies and growth ever panned out. Further, the price equates to about 14 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, which seems very reasonable to us. We like the strategy of focusing on the core business.","Western Union provides domestic and international money transfers through its global network of about 600,000 outside agents. The company handled over 270 million transactions in 2022 and is the largest money transfer company in the world.","Western Union's capital structure is fairly conservative, as management sees a strong credit profile as an advantage in attracting agents. The company carried $2.6 billion in debt at the end of 2022, resulting in debt/EBITDA of 2.5 times; this is a reasonable level, in our view, given the stability of the business. Western Union also typically holds a substantial amount of cash. Net debt at the end of 2022 was approximately $1.3 billion. We expect the company to hold a net debt position of about $2 billion over time. Given recent changes to tax laws, it's possible Western Union might not hold as much cash as it has historically, as it will no longer incur a tax penalty upon repatriation. This could help free management's hand, as the company historically has returned the bulk of its free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.",WU,Financial Services,4248425984.0,NYQ,6084984.0,USD,12.0600004196167,True,1,12.367529397851765,12.535365848998781,1
24/11/2023,"Capital One's Credit Cards Drive Loan Growth, but Credit Results Are Rapidly Returning to Normal",Capital One Financial Corp,COF,4,27/10/2023,Michael Miller,106.77,USD,23/11/2023,146.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,27/10/2023,"Narrow-moat-rated Capital One reported a good third quarter as credit costs came in lower than expected and pressure on the bank's net interest margin moderated. Net revenue increased 6% from last year and 4% from last quarter to $9.4 billion. Meanwhile, net income increased 6% year over year to $1.8 billion, which translates to a return on tangible equity of 19.59%. As we incorporate these results, we do not plan to materially alter our $146 per share fair value estimate. We see the shares as undervalued. Capital One's net interest income increased 6% year over year and 4% sequentially to $7.4 billion. The increase in net interest income was entirely due to loan growth, which continues to be driven by the bank's credit card receivables, which increased 16% from last year to $146.8 billion. On the other hand, auto loans and commercial loans both shrank 5% from last year. The bank is de-emphasizing these segments due to market conditions, and we expect its credit card portfolio to provide the bulk of loan growth for the foreseeable future. This does provide a tailwind to the bank's net interest margin as its loan mix shifts toward its higher-yielding credit card business. The banks NIM recovered sequentially to 6.7% from 6.5% last quarter, though it remains below the 6.8% reported in the prior-year quarter. Competition for deposits has been intense in 2023 as interest rates rose, creating headwinds for the bank's NIM. That said, with the Fed nearing the end of its rate hikes this pressure will likely alleviate, leaving Capital One to benefit from its shifting asset mix. While this does come at the cost of higher net charge-offs, credit costs were surprisingly tame during the quarter. Firmwide net charge-offs were 2.56% of total loans, up from 1.24% last year but down from 2.82% last quarter. Higher credit losses were most prominent in the bank's credit cards, where net charge-offs rose from 2.17% last year to 4.42% but were effectively flat from last quarter.","Capital One's credit card portfolio is enjoying rapid growth, providing a boost to the company's net interest margins and revenue growth. Technology investments, the transition away from legacy data centers, and its reduction in the branch count should help the company reduce costs in the coming years. Capital One has expanded its card product offerings as the bank leans into the commercial and luxury travel card spaces.","Credit card reward spending continues to rise industrywide, and competition for credit card holders remains intense. This will likely lead to higher spending for Capital One and could threaten returns on its credit cards. Capital One is exposed to a significant amount of subprime lending through its credit card and auto loan segments, while credit costs are set to rise. Capital One competes with online banks for deposits. This competition pushes its interest costs up as the bank must offer competitive rates.",11/08/2023,"Capital One maintains a more limited branch network than its traditional banking peers, using its online and mobile channels to acquire customers and service its accounts. The focus on online bank accounts has allowed the company to establish a national presence broader than what its narrow branch network would traditionally allow. This dynamic allows Capital One to enjoy the benefits of being a large bank without the expense of operating the branch system of a large bank. Capital Ones largest driver is its credit cards, which make up around 44% of its total loans. The banks remaining business mostly consists of commercial loans and auto loans through its consumer banking segment. The banks narrow product offering focuses its assets, giving Capital One the benefit of scale in its chosen business lines. This does have the consequence of leaving the bank undiversified as it is reliant on its credit cards and auto lending business.  Capital One's credit card receivable balances increased around 20% in 2022 as a combination of high consumer spending and heavy marketing drove impressive growth for the company. That said, the bank will need to compete aggressively with other credit card issuers to maintain this growth, particularly as it expands into the luxury travel card space. Capital One has also turned to the private label and co-branded credit card market for a boost, winning the BJ's Wholesale Club portfolio in 2022. While we appreciate the extra growth, private label cards typically require revenue sharing agreements with the partnered merchants, reducing returns.  On the other hand, credit costs are rising as net charge-offs normalize from unusually low levels in 2022. We do expect net charge-offs to continue to rise in 2023 and into 2024 as there are clear signs of normalization in the bank's credit metrics and we anticipate deeper economic pressure on its cardholder base as the impact of higher interest rates and the end of student debt forbearance filter though the economy. However, Capital One remains in a healthy financial position, and we do not foresee material financial strain, particularly if the labor market remains as resilient as it has been.","In our view, Capital One has a Narrow Morningstar Economic Moat Rating, as we believe it has durable competitive advantages that will allow it to continue to earn returns on tangible equity that are above its cost of capital. The companys heavy investment in technology and marketing has enabled it to use online bank accounts to build an asset and deposit base that is national in scope while maintaining a limited branch network. This has given Capital One the scale necessary to compete effectively in its business lines while keeping operational costs under control. In turn, this has allowed Capital One to enjoy returns on tangible equity that have been comfortably above its cost of capital.Banks typically create cost advantages by controlling operating expenses, building low-cost deposit bases, and utilizing effective underwriting to keep credit costs below their peers. Capital One has been particularly successful in keeping its operating structure lean. The companys efficiency ratio has averaged below 55% since 2012. This is better than peers, which as a group typically see efficiency ratios between 55% and 65%. The persistent difference in cost structure is a sign that the company has a competitive advantage through its cost management. This operating efficiency comes despite the companys heavy investments in marketing and technology, areas where the firm regularly spends more than 7% and 4% of its net revenue, respectively. Capital One makes up for its high marketing spending with low labor costs, which are typically only around 20%-25% of net revenue. While marketing spending is a key part of Capital Ones strategy, the expense is not core to the companys day-to-day operations. During periods of duress, the firm can turn and has turned to this line item to reduce its cost structure further when it needs to. We are confident in Capital Ones ability to continue managing noninterest costs and expect its efficiency ratio to improve over time.In our view, Capital Ones cost efficiency is driven by its large scale and small physical footprint relative to its size. Capital Ones consumer lending and credit card business lines are fully national with no region making up an outsize portion of its nearly $200 billion consumer loan book. Its commercial lending business is more focused, with roughly 50% of its roughly $70 billion in loans concentrated in the Northeast, where the companys branch network has historically been focused. Despite its size, Capital One has fewer than 500 branches, which is down from its peak of over 700 as the firm has been shrinking its already small footprint while expanding its deposit base and assets. This is achieved through Capital Ones heavy use of online deposits, which was jump-started in 2012 through its acquisition of ING Direct, now rebranded as Capital One 360. Online deposit gathering has allowed Capital One to develop and maintain a deposit base of sufficient size to finance a national lending arm while maintaining a slim service profile. Lending, particularly consumer lending, benefits significantly from scale as incremental sales growth can drive higher earnings against fixed costs. Additionally, much of Capital Ones consumer lending is supported by relationships with third parties, and the attractiveness of Capital One as a partner is enhanced by its size. The companys auto lending business (which has more than 95% of Capital Ones consumer banking assets) only makes loans for cars from participating dealerships. Capital Ones customers can shop for cars on its Auto Navigator website or its mobile app and get preapproved for a loan for a specific car before going to the dealership. The incentive for auto dealers to integrate their inventory with Capital Ones platform and participate in its lending program is that they gain access to Capital Ones client base. As Capital One is one of the largest auto lenders in the country, the incentive to be a part of its platform is considerable, given the size of its customer base. Additionally, while it is not the focus of the credit card business, Capital One does have a number of partnership agreements with retailers for private-label and cobranded general-purpose credit cards. A partnership agreement with a large national retailer can create billions in receivables that the credit card issuer is expected to finance safely. Most partnership agreements carry a targeted program size and approval rate. A certain level of scale is a prerequisite for banks to participate in this market. The size and geographical breadth of Capital Ones loans also diversifies them across multiple regions and FICO scores. This reduces the banks dependence on the economic conditions of any particular region in the country and allows it to accumulate a diverse array of lending data. Consumer lending is increasingly data driven as large proprietary data sets are needed to build the kinds of credit models necessary to make fast and effective underwriting decisions. As rapid credit decisions become the norm, access to large data sets and the ability to analyze them are increasingly a requirement to compete in consumer lending. Capital Ones heavy technology investments are enabled by its size and allow the company to utilize its broad lending data to support the moat around its business. Capital Ones size also allows it to market itself cost-effectively. We expect the company to continue spending heavily on marketing in order to increase its brand presence and drive incremental growth. Size allows Capital One to purchase video and display ads in bulk and finance national ad campaigns. While online deposits have allowed Capital One to increase the size and geographical breadth of its deposit base quickly, the heavy use of this funding source is not entirely without consequence. Enabled by the lack of physical infrastructure, savings accounts at online banks typically offer higher interest rates to depositors. Capital Ones own online accounts operate under a hybridized model in which clients manage their accounts through online or mobile access but still have access to Capital Ones small branch network. Despite the availability of its branches, Capital One still competes with online banks for deposits, which means they need to offer competitive interest rates to their depositors. This leads Capital One to have a high cost of funding from its interest-bearing deposit base relative to more traditional banks. Furthermore, only around 10% of Capital Ones deposits are non-interest-bearing, well below its peers. The result of this is that despite its success in building a large deposit base, with deposits making up more than 80% of its total funding, Capital One still has a relatively high cost of funding (3.11% in the first half of 2023). That said, the interest cost disadvantage of Capital Ones funding choices is outweighed by the cost efficiencies that they enable. Ultimately, Capital One does enjoy ROTE in the low double digits and has an efficiency ratio below its peers. These figures are important data points that point to Capital One having achieved a narrow moat through operating efficiency. On the regulatory front, Capital One is not considered large enough to be a global systemically important bank, allowing it to avoid the heaviest regulatory requirements. However, with over $250 billion in assets, Capital One is required to participate in the Federal Reserves annual stress tests and is subject to the full liquidity coverage requirements. Still, Capital One is large relative to other non-GSIB firms, placing it in a strong position from a relative regulatory cost perspective.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Capital One. The bank is exposed to the economic cycle as its profitability is affected by changes in credit quality, interest rates, and consumer spending. Capital One is more exposed to the credit cycle than most of its peers because of the large amount of subprime consumer lending it does. Around 31% of the banks credit card receivables and 47% of its auto loans are from borrowers with a FICO score lower than 660. There is the risk that a negative economic climate could lead to higher charge-offs from weaker borrowers. The companys economic exposure is increased by its volume of auto lending. Auto lending relies on the ability to resell repossessed vehicles at a reasonable price in order to keep net charge-offs low. If the value of this collateral falls due to economic pressure, then the credit risk of Capital Ones auto loans increases.Recently, this has become more of a concern as interest rates have risen and the prospects of a recession have increased. Credit losses were well below normal levels in 2022, but more recent credit performance data has shown that Capital One's net charge-offs are increasing rapidly. We expect net charge-offs to be higher in 2023 and to become elevated in 2024 as higher interest rates and a slower economy pressure consumer debt. That said, the bank's balance sheet is well capitalized, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7%, and we see limited risk that Capital One's financial position will be materially affected in the near future.There is some incremental environmental, social, and governance risk. There is inherent product governance risk to credit cards as they typically carry very high interest rates and can trap consumers in a cycle of continuously paying high interest rates as they struggle to reduce the principal. That said, Capital One's lending practices are in line with industry norms, and the ESG risk is not material enough to change our high uncertainty rating.","We give Capital One a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Standard. The balance sheet remains strong, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.7% at the end of June 2023, above the long-term target of 11%. The company is also conservatively provisioned, with its allowance for bad loans at around 4.70% of total receivables, well above pre-pandemic levels. This strength will likely see it through the current period of uncertainty unharmed and allow it to continue to return value to shareholders. Capital One has a history of making acquisitions that fit its strategic goals. The purchase of ING Direct in 2012 jump-started its direct banking efforts while adding considerable scale. This was followed by continued investments in technology, enabling the low-branch-count banking model. The company has also showed discipline when allocating its capital. It chose to fully exit its consumer real estate business in 2017 when it decided it did not have the scale to compete efficiently in a low-rate environment. Capital One's commitment to efficient capital allocation is encouraging and adds confidence that the company will continue to invest its capital intelligently. This discipline remains an important part of Capital One's ability to create value for shareholders as the company has made increasing use of acquired credit card portfolios to bolster receivable growth. Private label credit card programs often come with revenue sharing agreements and credit commitments that can create unattractive economics if Capital One overbids. Despite its current strength and good capital investment record, we are giving the company a Standard rating as it must contend with regulatory pressure when deciding how to allocate its capital, and large credit card portfolios often attract heavy stress testing. While the company is not considered a global systemically important bank, it does have more than $250 billion in assets and is subject to the Federal Reserves annual stress tests along with other regulatory requirements. This additional oversight can restrict Capital Ones ability to make distributions. In 2020, the bank was forced to slash its dividend 75% due to heavy provisioning as the COVID-19 pandemic affected the economy. This regulatory pressure adds external restrictions on the bank's use of capital.","Capital One is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered in McLean, Virginia. Originally a spinoff of Signet Financials credit card division in 1994, the company is now primarily involved in credit card lending, auto loans, and commercial lending.","Despite its credit exposure to credit cards and auto loans, we believe that Capital One is in a strong financial position. At the end of June 2023, Capital One had a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7%, up from 12.1% last year, and well above its long-term goal of 11%. This is despite Capital One building additional reserves in 2023, with its allowance for bad loans now at 4.70% of existing receivables.These figures do need to be viewed in the context of Capital Ones exposure to subprime credit cards and subprime auto loans. Roughly 31% of the banks domestic credit card portfolio is with cardholders whose FICO scores were below 660, and a similar portion of its auto loans is from borrowers with FICO scores below 620. Additionally, we foresee higher credit costs for Capital One in 2023 and beyond as higher debt levels, higher interest rates, and elevated prices for goods and services pressure consumer credit quality. We expect credit card net charge-offs to rise to 4.6% in 2023 and 5.80% in 2024 as credit conditions deteriorate in a slowing economy. That said, Capital One's balance sheet is in a good position. the 2022 Dodd-Frank stress test results saw Capital Ones common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to fall to 8% under the severely adverse scenario. This is despite a projected loss rate of 22.2% on the company's credit card portfolio and a loss rate of 14.7% on all loans in the severely adverse scenario. While Capital One does have credit-exposed assets, we believe that it is more than adequately capitalized to withstand the higher credit losses we are projecting.",COF,Financial Services,43389898752.0,NYQ,3390999.0,USD,106.7699966430664,True,1,102.2807057997753,130.56555543122963,1
24/11/2023,Digital Realty Offers a Full Menu of Tenants Data Center Needs After Enhancing Connectivity Feature,Digital Realty Trust Inc,DLR,3,27/10/2023,Matthew Dolgin,136.83,USD,23/11/2023,135.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,27/10/2023,"Digital Realty is still transitioning its data center portfolio to focus more on its highly connected campuses that can provide all the options customers want in an increasingly data-centric and connected world, which will be even more critical if and when artificial intelligence, or AI, becomes more widely used. The firm continues to see very strong demand and pricing, and it is selling data centers that are not strategic or connected to campuses. Sales growth remains strong, and we expect profits will follow as the transition to the higher-quality portfolio continues. Nothing disclosed in the quarter leads us to adjust our forecast, and were maintaining our $135 fair value estimate. Digital booked another $150 million in annualized revenue during the quarter, about 4% of the firms current annualized revenue (excluding pass-through revenue), and over the past year, bookings have totaled about 12% of the existing revenue stream. Digital finished the quarter with a record $422 million backlog after delivering $127 million into service during the quarter. On average, its now taking about a year for new bookings to come online. Pricing also remains strong across the board. Pricing for renewals under 1 megawatt was up 4.4% on a cash basis, and pricing for renewals over 1 megawatt was up 5.6%. The makeup of the bookings included a record $42 million for space with less than 1 megawatt of power and $12 million in interconnection revenue. We believe these are not only the most profitable revenue sources, but also signs that Digital tenants are coming to Digital for connection needs and proximity to cloud providers, which speaks to the quality and differentiation of a portfolio. The $97 million in bookings for space with more than 1 megawatt of power showcases the diversity of Digitals portfolio and the ability to also cater to the needs of tenants with greater computing needs who also need interconnectivity, which will be even more critical with AI.","Digital Realty's shift toward connection and co-location exposes it to the most attractive parts of the data center business and the growth tailwinds of cloud providers and data connectivity. Digital Realty's global offering and high exposure to cloud providers gives it an advantage over competitors that operate in more narrow geographies or can only offer retail co-location space. Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and other innovations that increase the public's demand for data and connectivity require more hardware and connections in data centers.","Equinix's foray into hyperscale eliminates Digital Realty's distinction as the biggest data center provider offering a full suite of services, from single cabinets to full, hyperscale data centers. Digital Realty is too dependent on cloud service providers, leaving it at the mercy of those companies. Technological advances will allow aggregate data needs to be met with less physical space and power and fewer direct connections, reducing data center needs.",27/10/2023,"Digital Realty has transformed its business from one that merely provided large companies vast amounts of space and power (a typical wholesale data center that houses few tenants) to one that can offer customers of all sizes the full spectrum of space, power, and connection needs (historically called a co-location data center that has space for many tenants). We think this evolutionlargely through acquisitions that focused on network-dense data centerswas critical for success in a modern environment where enterprises rely more on third-party cloud providers, and the constant use of data makes quick and easy access vital. With a sizable presence across nearly every continent, Digital also offers more value for multinational companies that want a fluid solution across their data center footprint. Along with Equinix, we think these qualities make Digital Realty one of only two data center providers that can offer this breadth and set itself apart from the rest of the pack in an industry with secular tailwinds stemming from the creation and use of more and more data. We think Digital Realtys ability to provide enough real estate for wholesale storage and computing needs along with a network-dense presence that facilitates interconnection in most of its geographies can make it a one-stop shop. Huge cloud providers drive the data center industry and need massive amounts of space and power, but they also need to connect to their customers, which happens via cloud on-ramps. Cloud providers locate on-ramps in data centers that have many networks connectingallowing secure and convenient access for cloud customers that need to link their premises to the data center that houses the on-ramp. Digital Realty still trails Equinix by a wide margin in housing on-ramps of major cloud providers and the level of network density in its data center portfolio, but it has the more unique feature of being able to offer wholesale space and power across nearly its entire footprint. The shifting quality of Digitals properties should translate to better returns on capital than a wholesale data center operator can generally provide and therefore a higher valuation multiple in the market.","We assign Digital Realty a narrow economic moat. Digital Realtys roots are as a wholesale data center provider, meaning that it leased very large amounts of space and power to relatively few tenants per facility. Although its wholesale nature left it as a simple real estate operator in our view, the size of the portfolio it amassed has given it cost advantages, and its mature portfolio also benefits from switching costs. We think the firms acquisitions and resulting portfolio transformation in recent years have made its properties less commodity-like, but we dont credit the firm as benefiting from a network effectlike we do for rival Equinixbecause network-dense data centers dont dominate Digitals property portfolio like they do for Equinix.We think switching costs provide Digital Realty's biggest competitive advantage, as there are numerous reasons tenants are unlikely to churn to a competitor, namely the significant monetary costs to deploy equipment and the risk in moving critical equipment. Digital Realty, citing statistics from Align Communications, estimates that a client deploying equipment to use 1.125 megawatts of powera fairly large customer, but the type Digital Realty traditionally caters towould spend $15 million-$30 million to set up its equipment. Migration of equipment from one facility to another would cost an additional $10 million-$20 million and bring with it a host of other challenges. Migrating to a new data center often requires the services of a company like Align, which specializes in it, and typically includes extensive planning, a multistep process, and involvement of many people within an organization. Migration risks include down time, which can be extremely harmful and expensive. Migrations thus typically include equipment mirroring, which is costly, to guard against down time. Given the monetary costs and business risks, we don't expect that tenants take a decision to move lightly, and we think they are effectively precluded from price-shopping once they are in a data center. Digital Realty claims most churn results from tenants merging or no longer needing a data center presence because of company-specific issues, such as their own business struggles.Based on the number of data centers, square footage, and power, Digital Realty is the largest owner of data center space globally, and we think its cost advantages stem from its scale and property ownership. Digital Realty has said it is one of the largest consumers of generators and air conditioning equipment in the world, and it receives modest discounts on them as a result. It also has recently begun negotiating power needs on an aggregated basis within given metropolitan areas rather than for each campus individually, leading to even more favorable deals with electric utility companies. For example, the company has previously locked in power rates in Chicago at a 20% discount to the market and secured lower-than-market rates in Texas. We are convinced that the current environment results in a durable competitive advantage that makes it likely Digital Realty will earn excess returns over the next decade, but the evolving nature of technology keeps us from labeling Digital Realty a wide-moat firm. On balance, the advent of the cloud has been good for data center businesses, as the number of firms reducing their own data center needs has been much more than offset by those that increasingly move off-site for interconnection with cloud service providers for their hybrid cloud needsthe most common model for large enterprises. However, the speed with which technology changes and data centers' close connection to it leave us wary about making a 20-year assumption with any confidence. While we see the possibility that enterprises will have less need for data centers if they use infrastructure as a service to a greater extent, our bigger concern is that companies will be able to satisfy their data center needs with less space and power. Hardware with more capacity in a smaller physical size and virtualization could each reduce the need for space over the long term even as enterprises use data centers for an increasing amount of data. Also, as cloud service providers become even more dominant, we expect they will have increasing control over data centers' fortunes. While they seem to be great customers now, we will not bank on that considering the leverage that they hold.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Digital Realty is High. The company's capital-heavy nature minimizes its ability to be agile in the face of a market downturn. We expect secular tailwinds to keep the firm's long-term upward trajectory intact, but if demand for third-party data centers weakens, Digital Realty would find itself with too much capacity and a weakened cost profile.We think technological advances pose the biggest risk to Digital Realty's long-term prospects, as they could result in an environment where cloud growth, interconnection, and data usage continue to grow but Digital Realty is not the beneficiary. Virtualization and Moore's law could result in a scenario where Digital Realty's customers satisfy their exploding data needs with less physical space and power.Big cloud providers' accumulating power in the market is a moderate risk for Digital Realty. We expect cloud providers' importance to continue growing, leaving Digital Realty more susceptible to these companies playing hardball. We do not think cloud providers want to compete in a retail co-location business, considering the difficulty we believe they would have in replicating a similar network of customers, but they could use their leverage to extract concessions. The biggest environmental, social, and governance risk we see is based on the massive power consumption data centers account for; a shift in how customers try to manage their own carbon footprints and in the publicity surrounding power consumption could be problematic. However, Digital Realty has been in front of this trend; it is working toward becoming carbon neutral and has a long-term goal of running 100% on renewable energy, though this adds the risk of being able to procure enough green energy at reasonable prices. Other risks include natural disasters bringing down data centers and the risk of cybersecurity breaches, as the world's most sensitive data all flows through data centers like the ones Digital Realty owns.","We assign Digital Realty a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. Our rating is based on the health of Digital Realtys balance sheet and our outlook with regard to investment in the business and shareholder distributions. We think business investment is likely to be the critical factor in determining shareholder returns.Digital Realty has been investing heavily for several years and made numerous sizable acquisitions. In our view, those decisions have been wise because they have significantly enhanced the network density of Digital Realtys data center portfolio and have positioned it firmly to be the sole company that can compete with Equinix on a global scale. We think these decisions have strengthened Digitals moat sources and positioned it to thrive for many years.However, the acquisitions have not come cheaply, and they have strained the firm's balance sheet and depressed returns on invested capital in the near term. We project ROICs to gradually rise over the next decade to the point where the firm is again earning economic profits, but it will require good execution, given the economic losses the acquisitions have prompted in the near term. The balance sheet is stretched, with net debt/EBITDA holding stubbornly above 6.0 for the past five years and total debt accounting for more than one fourth of Digital Realtys enterprise value. Nonetheless, we dont expect difficulty, as only about 15% of total debt matures within the next three years and EBITDA has covered interest expense by more than 5 times over the last five years, on average. Provided that the company doesnt continue making big acquisitions, we think cash flow generation will enable it to take down debt and provide an even bigger buffer for interest payments.We believe Digital Realtys shareholder distribution strategy is appropriate. The dividend is attractive, and the payout ratio as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA has been around 50% over the past five years. As a REIT, the firm is required to pay out 90% of REIT taxable income, and the dividend has grown 5% annually, on average, for the past five years. The firm has historically not repurchased shares, which we think is appropriate, given that we believe focusing capital allocation on investments has been a good strategy. We dont anticipate substantial share repurchases in the next several years.","Digital Realty owns and operates over 300 data centers worldwide. It has nearly 40 million rentable square feet across five continents. Digital's offerings range from retail co-location, where an enterprise may rent a single cabinet and rely on Digital to provide all the accommodations, to ""cold shells,"" where hyperscale cloud service providers can simply rent much, or all, of a barren, power-connected building. In recent years, Digital Realty has de-emphasized cold shells and now primarily provides higher-level service to tenants, which outsource their related IT needs to Digital. Digital Realty has also moved more into the co-location business, increasingly serving enterprises and facilitating network and cloud connections. Digital Realty operates as a real estate investment trust.","We think Digital Realty is in decent financial shape. Although it maintains a higher leverage ratio than Equinix (net debt of more than 6.5 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2022, above the 5.5 times it targets, compared with a target of 3-4 times for Equinix), we think its vast amount of property ownership and long-term contracts with very creditworthy customers allow it. Digital Realty owns over 80% of its over 300 data centers, almost all of which are in major metropolitan areas, including many where real estate is very expensive. Its interest coverage ratio (adjusted EBITDA/interest expense) was 6.5 and Digital had a large buffer between its position and all debt covenants at the end of 2022. Furthermore, it has a stable business that should not be materially weaker in a recession or even a global shutdown like the one that arose from COVID-19. Less than 20% of Digital Realty's debt is now floating-rate, and its debt maturities are well laddered.Despite the high debt leverage, Digital Realty has the ability to finance large acquisitions with equity if it chooses, as it did in 2017 when it acquired DuPont Fabros for $6.2 billion in stock and in 2020 when it acquired Interxion for about $7.3 billion in stock. Debt made up about 30% of Digital Realty's enterprise value at the end of 2022. Barring acquisitions, we expect Digital Realty will have the ability to bring down leverage substantially if it chooses, to under 5 times adjusted EBITDA by the end of our 10-year forecast, even after funding a growing dividend. As a REIT, Digital Realty is required to return at least 90% of REIT taxable income to shareholders.",DLR,Real Estate,42876370944.0,NYQ,2456809.0,USD,136.8300018310547,True,0,124.7070587158247,139.61012268066543,0
25/11/2023,Procedures Growth Remains Robust Across the Board for Intuitive Surgical,Intuitive Surgical Inc,ISRG,2,20/10/2023,Alex Morozov,315.8,USD,23/11/2023,230.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,20/10/2023,"Unsurprisingly, recent developments in weight loss drugs (GLP-1) and the resulting effect on weight-loss surgery dominated Intuitive Surgical's third-quarter earnings call despite bariatric procedures representing less than 5% of the total. While it is reasonable to assume that our and the market's prior expectations around bariatric penetration for robotics are too optimistic in light of the recent significant developments in weight loss therapies, this has little effect on our assumptions. We maintain our wide moat rating and $230 fair value estimate, but even with the stock pullback, shares remain in overvalued territory. For us, the key developments in the quarter were slower system placements, particularly outside the United States, offset by still robust procedures dynamics and improving utilization. Utilization growth remains above historic norms and the elevated levels are more indicative of what the future base line will look like, considering greater penetration of less complex (and thus quicker) procedures. System placements remain on a decelerating path as the company is bumping into the greenfield ceiling and in the absence of the next-generation platform, we don't expect the situation to change materially in 2024. However, that is not a problem for us as long as procedures growth remains healthy, which it is. Bariatric procedures growth decelerated, but the adoption and market share of robotics are still growing. The company is of the opinion that the current trends will lead to a deferral rather than a downright reduction of surgeries, considering a potentially limited time horizon for taking weight loss medication. We are not as sanguine and are dialing down the growth in bariatric surgeries overall and robotic penetration. But the effect on our assumptions is minimal, particularly if the company maintains a torrid growth path in other areas, particularly Ion, a robotic-assisted platform for minimally invasive lung biopsies.","The da Vinci system can assist multiple types of surgeries across numerous specialities, allowing hospitals to drive more procedures through the same platform. This diverse usage base also insulates Intuitive Surgical from potential specialized rival devices. Intuitive Surgical is enjoying tremendous success in general surgery, which is now its highest-volume surgical area. Hernia and bariatrics offer sizable opportunities. Intuitive's foray into bronchoscopy shows the company isn't resting on its laurels and is willing to look in other areas in need of robotic assistance.","We may be seeing the emergence of some competition, particularly for lower-cost procedures.  The firm's average utilization rate is well below its maximum (although growing rapidly), particularly outside the U.S. With greenfield system placements slowing, incremental installs will be more challenging, as hospitals will try to maximize the existing da Vincis' utility. With its installed base almost fully refreshed, Intuitive needs a new platform to generate upgrades and replacements. There are almost no old generation models in use in the U.S.",21/07/2023,"Intuitive Surgical fared remarkably well during the pandemic even as many hospitals struggled with tight capital budgets and elective surgeries were almost nonexistent during the COVID-19 peak. Now, with things returning to normal, the company is set to resume its march toward global adoption of robotic surgery. Our long-term positive view on the company's competitive positioning is unchanged, even as new rivals are entering the previously monopolistic area of robot-assisted surgery.  We don't consider our long-term thesis on Intuitive to be particularly conservative. Even with the company's procedure volume likely to exceed 2 million in 2023, we think the total addressable global market of several times the size still offers ample growth opportunities, particularly overseas. The ultimate ceiling for robotic surgery is virtually unlimited, with existing applications only scratching the surface of all possible procedures in soft tissue surgery that could migrate to the robot. A number of categories still offer sizable unpenetrated and underpenetrated opportunities, both in and outside the United States. Robotic surgery's acceptance in most of the developed world is significantly lower than in the U.S., and in the absence of formidable competitors (up until recently), Intuitive should continue to dominate the robotic surgery arena.  Growth will start decelerating in a number of procedures, with penetration rates hitting a ceiling. Intuitive is proactively taking the right steps to improve its economic appeal, which has allowed it to make some inroads into markets we view as less suitable for a robot. While most demand has historically been U.S.-based, Intuitive will increasingly rely on growth internationally, where it has seen more skepticism in the past. System placements outside the U.S. now represents nearly half of total installations, supporting our expectations of healthy demand.","Through its expanding installed base of roughly 8,000 da Vinci systems and its vast procedure database, we think Intuitive Surgical has dug a wide moat around its business. Healthy system and instrument pricing reflects the firm's monopoly status in its niche, allowing Intuitive Surgical to achieve profitability rarely enjoyed by medical equipment makers, with adjusted operating margins in the low 30s. In fact, gross margins on Intuitive's systems are comparable to its instruments (consumable component) profitability, which is distinctive in an industry where consumables typically command a much higher gross margin.Rarely does such an attractive and rapidly growing market as robotic surgery stay impenetrable by competition for as long as it has, and the firm's monopoly has recently ended, although Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson have struggled mightily to get their competing platforms to the market (the latter is still in the late development stage). Even as several competitors enter the field, noneeven the established device companies like Medtronic or J&Jare in a position to alter the industry landscape, significantly disrupt the firm's operations, or erode its returns on capital. Intuitive's intellectual property on its system and growing instrumentation base is a sizable barrier, but it is the ever-growing clinical database that presents the biggest challenge for a new entrant. To amass the body of data that Intuitive possesses, new competitors will have to convince enough hospitals to purchase or trial their instrumentation for an extensive period, train robot-naive or da Vinci-trained surgeons, and recruit willing patients. However, we are certain that competing instrumentsif priced attractivelymay make inroads into procedures/specialities currently underpenetrated by Intuitive, particularly in hospitals that have balked at da Vinci's cost. Intuitive is responding to this threat by expanding its platform roster to include lower-cost alternatives, offering operating leases to soften the high-sticker-price impact, and lowering the instrument cost to be more comparable with manual laparoscopy.Once a hospital purchases Intuitive's system, switching costs become exorbitant, as the average system price around $1.5 million represents a large portion of a typical hospital's annual capital expenditure budget. Customers would need a very compelling technology or price difference to switch before their machines wear out naturally (the upgrade cycle is around five to eight years). Given the need to purchase new instruments with each procedure, installed systems should provide a relatively dependable stream of revenue per procedure as long as surgeons continue to use them.The biggest threat to Intuitive's moat is the future of robotic surgery in general. It is plausible that cash-strapped hospitals that receive no additional reimbursement for robot usage may opt for a plodding yet cheaper alternative of manual laparoscopy, particularly if the clinical body of work supporting robotic surgery over traditional MIS is lacking. It is also plausible that robotic surgery may face application limitations, but considering the number of various procedures already performed on da Vinci, this seems unlikely. With several new entrants challenging the firm, the prospects for the first time are less certain. For now, we anticipate only marginal competitive pressures, but over time Intuitive's formidable competitors might make a dent in its dominance. Last, but not least is the big unknownartificial intelligencewhich could be a threat to the moat, but also an opportunity as Intuitive through its massive installed base and procedures history would be in a leading position to capitalize on advancements in this area.","We assign Intuitive Surgical a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. One of the key long-term risks to Intuitive is that competitors introduce a compelling alternative to da Vinci procedures, siphoning off some of Intuitive's growth opportunities and potentially reducing the profitability of its business. We are particularly curious about J&J's and Medtronic's foray into robotic surgery as both firms have strong presence in soft tissue surgery already (although J&J's setback and unlikely entrance into the market until after 2024 is reaffirming our position that robotic surgery is hard). Aside from competition, other factors could impede robotic surgery's rapid advancement. Robotic surgery has yet to establish itself as a good alternative to manual laparoscopy in certain procedures, particularly outside the U.S. As reimbursement doesn't distinguish between manual and robotic MIS, and robotic instrumentation costs more, hospitals are forced to eat the difference between the two procedures, and if clinical benefit isn't well established, manual laparoscopy may prevail. Finally, cost-conscious hospitals, particularly outside the U.S., have been cautious in adopting da Vinci. We don't see any risk on the environmental, social, and governance front, with only limited past controversies around product safety.","Intuitive Surgical has a superb record when it comes to organic growth and returns on capital. While the technology in itself is revolutionary, which is a testament to Intuitive's vision, it is the management team's ability to drive its adoption and expand it into other areas that has been superb. We applaud the company's dedication to research and development, shielding its robust returns on capital, aversion to expansion in unrelated areas via acquisitions, and appropriate share-buyback policy (which appears to have slowed as the shares have reached lofty levels). We are positive on the company's expansion into bronchoscopy. Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Intuitive is Exemplary.","Intuitive Surgical develops, produces, and markets a robotic system for assisting minimally invasive surgery. It also provides the instrumentation, disposable accessories, and warranty services for the system. The company has placed more than 8,000 da Vinci systems in hospitals worldwide, with nearly 5,000 installations in the U.S. and a growing number in emerging markets.","Intuitive's balance sheet is spotless, with zero debt and ample cash. While the company could arguably leverage its balance sheet, its strict cash deployment policy limits its usage to tuck-in acquisitions, reinvestment, and frequent and significant share buybacks. Our balance sheet health concerns are extremely limited as the company delivers strong cash flows.",ISRG,Healthcare,110973100032.0,NMS,1388826.0,USD,315.79998779296875,True,0,293.3937647202435,359.5941983446642,1
24/11/2023,Solid Recovery but JR East's Longer-Term Outlook Dimmed by Aging Population,East Japan Railway Co,9020,3,21/11/2023,Adrian Atkins,7988.0,JPY,24/11/2023,7500.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,C,21/11/2023,"JR East's first-half fiscal 2024 operating income tripled to JPY 192 billion compared with the prior corresponding period, or PCP. The strong result was a little better than expected and driven by a strong recovery of demand as the pandemic impact fades. Management maintained full-year EBIT guidance of JPY 270 billion, with a weaker second half expected because of a seasonal increase in maintenance and other costs. Management noted that the transportation segment was recovering faster than expected, while the retail and real estate segments fell short of expectations. We upgrade our earnings forecasts to a little above guidance following the strong first half and lift our fair value estimate 4% to JPY 7,500 per share. At current prices, the stock screens as fairly valued. Transportation earnings recovered strongly, with EBIT of JPY 118 billion up 583% compared with the PCP, which was affected by the pandemic. The improved result was underpinned by a 17% increase in revenue and relatively stable costs. Total passenger revenue is back to 89% of prepandemic levels and we expect further improvement as passenger demand strengthens and on price increases. Shinkansen business demand has recovered relatively slowly, with web conferencing a key headwind. Management will focus on growing tourism demand and JR Pass prices to offset.  In-station retail and services EBIT doubled in the first half to JPY 23 billion, on 19% growth in revenue. The result benefited from the rebound in railway usage and improved product lineup and efficiency. Advertising revenue remains weak at 55% of prepandemic levels as advertising budgets tend to lag economic recoveries. We expect improvement soon. Real estate and hotels EBIT increased 26% to JPY 40 billion in the first half. Hotel revenue is tracking above management's expectations on stronger inbound tourism, while office and shopping center rents are broadly tracking expectations.","JR East generates solid returns from railway services, with an added boost from retail and property development in and around the stations.  The operating environment remains favorable to regulated railway operators in Japan. Under the cost-plus method, the company can pass on the vast majority of input cost increases to passengers. JR East owns high-quality infrastructure and property assets and generates defensive cash flows.","Returns are at risk from Japan's aging demographics and shrinking population, a key earnings headwind.  Natural disasters may disrupt railway services and add costs. JR East is highly leveraged following the pandemic, although balance sheet risk is somewhat mitigated by its longer-dated debt.",21/11/2023,"East Japan Railway Company, or JR East, is Japans largest railway network operator. It runs both long distance bullet trains, known as Shinkansen, and shorter municipal train routes around and from Tokyo. More than 40% of revenue is from conventional train services within the Greater Tokyo Area, where it served about 17 million passengers per day prior to the pandemic. About 20% of revenue is from Shinkansen connecting Tokyo with regional cities and popular tourist destinations, and most of the balance is from retail operations and real estate investments.  Basic ticket prices are regulated using a building block approach to calculate a fair return for investors after covering costs. Returns can be enhanced by extra charges for seat reservations, first class seats, and non-Shinkansen express trains. JR East extracts additional value through upgrading retail offerings within stations and developing adjacent mixed commercial centers, including retail, office, residential and hotel properties. Being in Tokyo, which is wealthy and densely populated, enables the company to garner solid returns from redeveloping its existing land and properties. JR East has two large developments underway at Takanawa and Oimachi stations close to central Tokyo. These developments are expected to complete by 2026 and be key drivers of medium-term earnings growth. Earnings should also benefit from steady recovery of transport, retail and hotel revenue as the pandemic impact fades. Costs, however, are also rising, particularly raw materials, energy and wages. We also expect higher interest rates over the long term, which is a key headwind given the firm carries substantial, albeit mostly fixed-rate, debt. Lastly, secular population decline is likely to gradually reduce ridership on the trains, hurting efficiency.  ","We believe JR East has a narrow economic moat based on efficient scale, where new entrants are discouraged by expected low returns from duplicating the rail network, and cost advantages to other forms of transportation. We expect decent midcycle returns from the regulated rail network, marginally exceeding costs of capital, and strong returns from in-station retail services as it leverages the rail network's heavy foot traffic. The real estate and hotel division benefits from slight cost advantages where it can upgrade existing landholdings adjacent to train stations, but overall is not considered ""moaty.""Returns on invested capital of about 6% prior to the pandemic exceeded our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. While returns turned negative during the pandemic because of lower passenger numbers and stubborn fixed costs, they are steadily recovering, and we think likely to marginally eclipse costs of capital in several years as passenger demand recovers and ticket prices rise. A wide moat is precluded as it requires near certainty of excess returns within a decade, which is a stretch given uncertainty over passenger demand, operating costs and regulation. Japans high population density along the Pacific Coast is highly conducive to efficient railway transportation. Tokyos central 23 wards have more train stations per kilometer than almost any other city on Earth, including New York and London. Being fast, convenient, and affordable, train transportation is by far the most popular mode of transport in Japan, with a roughly two-thirds share of domestic passenger transportation kilometers, with planes, buses, and private cars each holding shares of a little over 10%. While numerous private companies operate rail lines in Tokyo, we think competition is minimal as consumer preference is mainly driven by convenience of station locations, connecting lines, and minimizing transit times. In Tokyo and other Japanese cities, buses typically serve local areas around trains stations and feed passengers onto the rail network, rather than compete with trains. Taxis and private cars are infrequently used alternatives because of the cost, including expensive tolls, and risk of heavy traffic. For longer distances, Shinkansen face modest competition from low-cost coaches, but these are typically less convenient, slower and more dangerous. Similarly, air transportation is slower except for very long distances after considering time spent traveling to and from airports, and checking in. Due to rail's structural advantages, the government retains heavy influence over JR East via regulation. Japan's railways operate under a cost-plus system, with regular fare resets to incorporate changes to the economic environment. The regulator sets a cap on basic ticket prices based on a building block approach to provide a fair return to investors after covering optimal operating costs, depreciation, interest costs, and taxes. JR East can increase prices for non-Shinkansen express tickets, first class tickets, and seat reservation charges without regulatory approval to earn excess returns. However, if total revenue exceeds the regulated allowance, then the regulator wont increase basic fares further. The government also has scope to increase lease payments when leases end to take a greater share of profits. But this isnt a major concern as only a few percent of railway assets are leased and leases are long, at about 30 years from inception.","We assign JR East a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, with relatively defensive revenue and a positive medium-term outlook balanced by high financial leverage. Other risks include potential adverse regulatory changes, natural disasters, and the impact of secular population decline. With high financial leverage, a potential tightening of credit conditions could make it difficult to refinance maturing debt, and rising interest rates could weigh heavily on net income and credit metrics. More challenging credit conditions could also hurt real estate sales. JR East's rail networks are regulated. Changes to the regulatory system could hurt earnings potential. For example, regulation could be broadened to incorporate first class ticket prices and seat reservation charges. Japan's aging demographics and declining population pose a risk to passenger demand. With high fixed costs, falling usage could have an outsize impact on efficiency and earnings. The population in Japan has been in decline since 2011 and is now starting to decline in the Greater Tokyo Area. We believe ESG risks are low, given trains are more environmentally friendly than alternatives such as cars, buses, and planes, and the firm is investing in renewable energy generation to reduce carbon emissions. Other ESG risks include not maintaining acceptable safety and reliability standards, but we think this is unlikely given the firm's strong track record and appropriate maintenance budget. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis could damage assets and hurt financial performance, but would most likely be temporary setbacks. ","We assign JR East a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on its weak but improving financial health, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. JR East's financial health is relatively weak following the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw earnings plummet and debt grow. We expect credit metrics to remain stretched in the near term, but significant improvement is likely in the medium term as earnings recover from the pandemic and benefit from completion of developments, which are mostly funded by retained earnings. Management plans to get net debt/EBITDA back to a conservative 3.5 times over the long term, which we think is possible in 10 to 15 years. Overall, we are comfortable with JR East's financial position. We rate investment efficacy as fair. The business incurs substantial maintenance costs, mainly relating to the large rail network. This is necessary spending to maintain the safety and reliability of the network. Most growth capital expenditure is earmarked for real estate developments, including mixed commercial centers at Takanawa and Oimachi stations. This makes sense as the firm takes advantage of underutilized land around its stations. Some investment in rail is planned, including a new line to Haneda Airport and first-class carriages on the Chuo rapid line. The firm's hurdle rates are lowunleveraged internal rates of return of 4.4% for real estate developments and 3.0% for rail projectsbut this is reasonable in the current low interest rate environment. Shareholder distributions are appropriate. JR East has a long-term dividend payout ratio of 30% and plans to return a further 10% to shareholders via share buybacks in the medium term as earnings recover. While shareholder returns are relatively low, we think this is appropriate given substantial capital expenditure requirements and high financial leverage.","East Japan Railway Company, or JR East, is the largest railway operator in Japan. It was originally established when the government-owned nationwide railway operator underwent a six-way territorial split in 1987, though it wasn't fully privatized until 2002. It runs both long distance bullet trains, known as Shinkansen, and shorter municipal train routes around and from Tokyo. Its 7,400 kilometers of rail track covers half of Japan's population and a third of the country's land area. Two thirds of revenue is from transportation, with most of the rest from retail operations and real estate investments. ","We are comfortable with JR East's financial health. Credit metrics deteriorated sharply during the pandemic but are now improving as earnings recover. The conservative dividend payout ratio also helps as retained earnings can fund growth projects or reduce debt. Net debt/EBITDA increased from 3.4 times in fiscal 2019 to 19 times in 2022, based on management's adjusted numbers. We forecast still aggressive net debt/EBITDA of 7 times in fiscal 2024, improving to a reasonable 5 times over the next five years. Management plans to get net debt/EBITDA back to 3.5 times over the long term, which we think is possible in 10 to 15 years. JR East maintains strong credit ratings (A+ from Standard and Poor's) and maintained support from lenders during the pandemic. It has a relatively long debt maturity profile, with JPY 300 to 400 billion of debt maturing each year to 2028, compared with forecast average annual EBITDA of JPY 800 billion.

25/11/2023,Autoliv to Capitalize on Backlog in Passive Safety Technology,Autoliv Inc,ALIV SDB,3,22/10/2023,Richard Hilgert,1077.0,SEK,24/11/2023,1110.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,22/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Autoliv reported third-quarter earnings per share before special items of $1.66, missing the $1.79 FactSet consensus EPS by $0.13, but it is $0.43 ahead of the $1.23 reported last year. We believe the shortfall was due to a slight increase in customer output disruption sequentially from the second quarter and inflationary cost pressures. Revenue increased 13% to $2.6 billion as volume, customer recoveries, and the chip shortage all improved compared with a year ago. Excluding favorable currency, organic revenue increased 11%, outperforming a 4% increase in global light-vehicle production by 7 percentage points due to launched new business and customer recoveries. Adjusted operating income jumped 41% to $243 million from $173 million last year. Margin expanded 190 basis points to 9.4% from 7.5% last year on higher volume and cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by slightly worse customer call-offs compared with the second quarter. Despite the UAW strike at Autolivs Detroit 3 customers, management tweaked 2023 guidance higher with organic revenue growth of 17%, up from 15%, and reduced tax rate to 20% from 32% due to reorganization on cost-cutting efforts. Adjusted operating margin guidance was unchanged at 8.5%-9.0%. The UAW strike had minimal impact on the third quarter, but the firm said it expects $6 million in revenue per week strike impact and assumes the labor shutdown lasts until the end of November in its guidance. We model revenue slightly below managements guidance, with organic revenue growth of 15%. Due to high uncertainty remaining from the UAW strike, output disruption (chips, logistics), inflation, war in Ukraine and Israel, and weakening global auto market economies, we assume an 8.5% 2023 adjusted operating margin at the low end of guidance. The time value of money added $2 to our fair value estimate, lifting our fair value estimate to $101 from $99. The 3-star-rated Autoliv shares trade at a 4% discount to our new fair value.","Autoliv possesses a culture that enables regular and consistent innovation, commercializing technology that generates solid margins and returns on invested capital. Increasing safety content per vehicle across global markets is a growth opportunity for which Autoliv is well positioned. Rising U.S. and European NCAP safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use advanced safety technologies to achieve a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety systems interact with active safety.","The auto-parts supply industry is highly competitive and customers expect annual, contractual price reductions. The cyclical, capital-intensive nature of the industry means that a modest volume decline could translate into a significant drop in profitability. Raw material costs are volatile, adding a degree of uncertainty to margins.",22/10/2023,"Autoliv is the global market leader (43% share in 2022) and is well positioned for growth in vehicular passive safety content. An ability to innovate and then commercialize technology has helped support profitability and returns. Rising New Car Assessment Program safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use active safety features to even be considered for a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety products interact with active safety systems in occupant collision protection. As consumers in emerging markets become wealthier, demand for safety content should increase. In addition, as roads become more crowded and traffic fatalities increase, developing countries may require safety legislation similar to that required in Europe and the United States. Autoliv has demonstrated technological leadership. The company and its predecessors introduced two-point seat belts, the retractable seat belt, seat belt pretensioners, side-impact air bags, and various pedestrian collision safety technologies. It annually spends about 5% of sales on research and development and holds more than 6,600 patents, mainly in air bags and seat belts. Additionally, Autoliv has produced an average of 4.4 percentage points of returns in excess of its cost of capital since 2002. More than 70% of Autoliv's workforce is located in low-cost countries, compared with about 30% at the end of 2002. We view this as a strategic positive as Autoliv pursues business in developing markets, leading to a leaner cost structure and enabling the firm to spend larger amounts on research and development without compromising margins. It also positions the company to take advantage of its customers' objective to use more global, common vehicle architectures.","The sources of Autoliv's narrow economic moat rating include its intangible assets, high customer switching costs, and to a much lesser degree, its cost advantage. Some safety product areas are also oligopolistic, resulting in a slight efficient scale moat source benefit. The company's moat also benefits from a substantial global manufacturing presence, highly integrated and long-term customer ties that result in sticky market shares, and moderately improved pricing power from a well-diversified customer base. Since 2002, Autoliv's return on invested capital has exceeded its weighted average aftertax cost of capital for an average of 4.4 percentage points in economic profit. Autoliv's consistent technology innovation enables favorable pricing relative to many automotive industry suppliers, increasing the company's dollar content per vehicle. New innovations typically debut on European and North American luxury vehicles, where average safety content is around $400 per vehicle. In general, automakers are willing to pay for components and systems that provide substantial product differentiation, weight reduction, enhanced safety, or reduced cost, as is the case with Autoliv. Having a diversified global customer base provides Autoliv the opportunity to maximize pricing of its innovative product technologies by selling to a broader group of clients. Autoliv's customers would incur prohibitively high switching costs should they decide to withdraw business in the middle of a vehicle program, especially when Autoliv has a supply agreement for a complete set of passive safety systems. Costs for switching to another supplier would include the substantial lead time and investment to develop and validate new components, the potential for production disruptions, and the cost of moving equipment and tooling. The whole process of changing a critical supplier like Autoliv might cost an original equipment manufacturer as little as a few million dollars to as much as several hundred million dollars, depending on the size and scope of the components or systems being replaced.Automotive OEMs prefer vendors like Autoliv that can supply components and systems on a global basis. To reduce costs, some of the underlying safety components of a particular vehicle sold in the U.S. may be the same as another vehicle that might be sold in Europe, South America, or Asia. As emerging-market countries develop, a greater number of these safety components may become common to more than one region. Also, some countries have local content laws that require a certain percentage of components to be sourced from within that country. Winning a contract to supply a major component or system for a global vehicle program requires a supplier with a substantial global manufacturing presence.With more than 70% of Autoliv's global workforce now located in low-cost countries, the company has a lower fixed-cost base than other automotive suppliers without a moat. Developing a global footprint like Autoliv'swith 62 production facilities in 27 countrieswould require a huge capital investment, a substantial barrier to entry for potential competitors, particularly given the challenges for auto suppliers to consistently turn an economic profit. Close ties with OEM customers are integral to success in the automotive industry supply base and create another significant barrier to entry. New-vehicle lead times can run as long as 36 months. Autoliv's engineers participate very early in the development process, especially when an all-new vehicle platform is being developed, because safety is not only important to consumers but also mandated by governments. Once launched, most vehicle programs have a 5- to 10-year lifecycle, assuring Autoliv long-term contractual streams of revenue, albeit subject to volume changes dependent on consumer demand for specific models and overall economic conditions. When a vehicle nameplate has a complete redesign, including active and passive safety systems, and Autoliv is the supplier for the predecessor program, the company typically becomes the incumbent supplier for the redesigned successor vehicle program. In total, Autoliv potentially has a 6- to 13-year tie-up (development and production) with each customer's vehicle program. We view Autoliv's diverse, well-established, long-term, highly integrated customer relations, supplying hundreds of vehicle programs, as an invaluable barrier to entry.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Autoliv is High. Commodity costs and declines in global vehicle production present the biggest risk to Autoliv. Commodity exposure to volatile oil, steel, and copper prices adds risk to margins during periods of high inflation. Annual contractual price reductions for OEM customers are an auto industry norm, so Autoliv has to aggressively employ kaizen, kanban, and Six Sigma Lean manufacturing programs to advance cost savings. To maintain pricing and margin, Autoliv also requires continual investment in innovation. A loss of focus in cost reduction or technological development could result in an erosion of profitability and return on invested capital.Additionally, the company operates in a capital-intensive industry subject to cyclical demand. As a result, Autoliv has a high degree of operating leverage, so sudden declines in volume can have a meaningful impact on profit. Conversely, any increase in sales following large cost-cutting measures significantly raises profits. The potential changes to profitability brought on by the firm's operating leverage and cyclical demand results in our High Uncertainty Rating.We think Autoliv has some environmental, social, and governance risk exposure, which we include in our uncertainty rating. The firm supplies the global automotive industry, which is transitioning to zero-emission electric powertrains from emission-producing internal combustion engines. Autoliv provides passive safety products for electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. The firm also has product governance risk exposure from potential vehicle safety recalls, which have increased compliance scrutiny from various governments' safety regulations. Autoliv's products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain highly skilled human capital with expertise in various engineering disciplines.","We assign Autoliv a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized maintainable midcycle, we estimate Autoliv's return on invested capital exceeds its weighted average cost of capital by roughly 10 percentage points.The balance sheet is sound, with 1.1 times net debt/EBITDA and a net debt/total capital ratio of 14% at the end of December 2022. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound. Management states that it targets net debt/EBITDA of 0.5-1.5 times and a strong investment-grade credit rating. Since 2012, the company has returned roughly $3.2 billion to investors, averaging about $300 million per year, in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. During the past 15 years, Autoliv's median dividend payout ratio is approximately 35%. However, cash-conservation measures deployed because of COVID-19 included the suspension of the dividend and share repurchases after the first quarter of 2020. Autoliv reinstated its quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2021.Upon the spinoff of Veoneer in July 2018, Mikael Bratt became the president and CEO of Autoliv, replacing Jan Carlson, who had held the position since 2007 and who became president and CEO of Veoneer. Before assuming his current position, Bratt had been president of Autoliv's passive safety group since May 2016. Before joining Autoliv, Bratt was with Volvo Group for 30 years, most recently serving as the executive vice president in charge of group truck operations and previously as Volvo Group CFO. We expect Bratt to continue Autoliv's record of creating shareholder value.We like that management creates shareholder value by returning profits to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After the 2009 Great Recession, the company resumed its dividend effective for the third quarter of 2010 and increased it 17% for the fourth quarter of that year. In 2020, the company terminated quarterly dividends after paying $0.62 per share in the first quarter. The dividend was reinstated in the second quarter of 2021 at $0.62 per share but raised to $0.64 in the fourth quarter and then to $0.66 late in 2022. During the 15-year period from 2007 to 2022, dividends per share grew at a 4% average annual rate. A share-repurchase program is still in effect. The company reactivated a share-repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2013. Since then, Autoliv has repurchased over $1.1 billion worth of its stock. In November 2021, the board authorized a new share-repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion or 17 million shares, whichever comes first, from January 2022 to the end of 2024. Autoliv also deserves credit for its financial transparency. The company provides more detailed information than many of the parts companies we cover.","Autoliv is the global leader in passive safety components and systems for the auto industry. Products include seat belts, frontal air bags, side-impact air bags, air bag inflators, and steering wheels. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is the company's largest customer at 11% of 2022 revenue, with Stellantis accounting for 11% and Volkswagen 10%. At 34% of 2022 revenue, the Americas was Autoliv's largest geographic region, followed by Europe at 27%, China at 21%, and Japan at 8%.","We view Autoliv's financial health as relatively strong for an auto-parts supplier. Excluding commercial paper and overdraft facilities, the company has excellent liquidity of $1.7 billion, with approximately $0.6 billion in cash and an undrawn $1.1 billion revolving credit line at the end of December 2022. Since 2012, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR has averaged an investment-grade credit level of 1.9 times. While credit facilities are unsecured and there are no financial covenants on the firm's debt, management seeks to maintain a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.5-1.5 times and was at 1.1 times at the end of 2022. Overall, Autoliv's financial health and free cash flow generation are much better than many in its peer group. We view the company as being well positioned to withstand a challenging decline in global new-vehicle demand, which was demonstrated during COVID-19-induced industrywide factory closures in 2020.Autoliv has generally maintained a conservatively financed balance sheet. Capital requirements have been met with funding from operating cash flow and the company's unsecured revolving line of credit.

25/11/2023,Cintas Remains Well Positioned in the Industry and Continues to Grow Strategically,Cintas Corp,CTAS,2,26/09/2023,Joshua Aguilar,554.9,USD,24/11/2023,410.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,26/09/2023,"Wide-moat Cintas reported strong 2024 first-quarter results with growth in all three business segments and in line with our annual forecast. We raise our fair value estimate by nearly 3% to $410 from $400, driven primarily by time value of money and our confidence in the firms growth strategy. We're optimistic given Cintas' long-term focus on margin expansion, new customer acquisitions, and strategic technological investments. However, we still think the stock is overvalued, as it currently trades in 2-star territory. Total revenue for the quarter increased 8.1% year on year to $2.34 billion. We see solid growth across all segments, driven by high customer retention, new business offerings, and aggressive cross-selling sales efforts. The uniform rentals segment posted a revenue increase of 7.6%. Sales for first aid and safety increased 11.3%. The all other segment was up 8.7%, led by the fire protection business, growing at 16.6%. However, uniform direct sales declined by 5.4%. We think this is temporary. The direct sales business has mostly been a consistent sales grower since first-quarter2022, and it successfully recaptured most of its lost sales from the pandemic. We forecast the subsegment will grow at around a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. During the first quarter, moderating inflation forced Cintas to reduce its price increases in line with historical levels, ending several quarters of higher-than-normal pricing. Despite this, increased sales volume and decreased cost of goods sold (as a percentage of revenue) ensured continuous profit growth. Total operating margin increased 110 basis points to 21.4%, marking an all-time high. We expect this figure to improve incrementally as the firm shifts toward a higher-margin business mix. We believe Cintas margin improvements should more than offset the weaker price hikes and maintain high profitability. Clarification: Cintas will be lowering price hikes (in line with historical levels), not reducing pricing.","Cintas industry-leading operating efficiency stems from its significant scale-based cost advantages, achieved through superior route density. The firms impressive sales execution is supporting robust new business wins and greater penetration among existing customers. There is still ample opportunity for expansion, as companies in the sizable unvended market look to outsource their uniform programs and facilities services.","The firms competitors are not standing still, and large providers like UniFirst and Aramark are also growing its routes and pursuing market share.  Since Cintas' core uniform services business is correlated with U.S. employment trends, its operating performance is highly cyclical in nature.  Cintas periodically acquires firms to diversify its business. It is possible the firm will make poor investment decisions and overpay.",26/09/2023,"Cintas is the dominant provider in the $20 billion U.S. uniform rental/sales and related ancillary services industry. It enjoys a roughly 31% market share. It has a diversified customer base of over 1 million large corporations and small and midsize businesses across North America, with no singular customer making up for more than one percent of total revenue. Despite its already impressive position, we expect Cintas will grow over the next 10 years. The firm constantly considers new product lines while emphasizing cross-selling to its existing customers and investing in technologies to enhance customer retention and operational efficiency. About 60% of its annual sales growth derives from new client wins. With a current market penetration rate at below 20%, the remaining unvended market remains sizable. Cintas' first aid and safety segment previously benefited from a high growth of personal protective equipment sales in fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, but as we are now in fiscal 2024 and COVID-19 is under control, the segment is returning to a more traditional level as expected. This is not all bad news, since traditional items like first aid cabinets post higher margins. We project sales in the segment will grow at a 6.4% compound annual growth rate over the next 10 years. We also project an above-industry 10-year CAGR for its core uniform rental segment at around 8%, and a strong CAGR of above 10% for its ""all other"" segment, which includes fire protection services and direct uniform sales. Management has navigated the tough economic environment well over the last year, and cost management has been impressive. Despite the labor shortages that some of its customers are facing, demand remains robust, and momentum seems strong, with more than 11 million job openings in the country.","We assign Cintas overall a wide moat because of cost advantage derived from Cintas route density and economies of scope. Cintas core uniform rental segment maintains a wide economic moat on its own, and it leads the firms growth with the highest margins and return on invested capital.Cintas infrastructure dominates the U.S. with 11,500 delivery routes (in over 330 cities), over 3 times more than Aramarks total of 3,450 routes. Its 461 operational facilities in the U.S. alone are meaningfully higher than UniFirst, which has a mere 260 facilities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe combined. Cintas broad geographic footprint enables drivers to minimize windshield time, or the amount of time spent on the road when traveling from customer to customer. Increased customer proximity allows drivers to maximize the number of customers they serve on a given route, significantly decreasing the cost of transportation, including labor and fuel, which account for around one third of the total expenses Cintas incurs. Consequently, Cintas has over 10% better gross margins than its closest competitors in UniFirst and Aramark.Cintas adeptly targets nonprogrammers, or potential customers that dont yet outsource these services, which makes up 60% of Cintas annual total revenue. Cintas well-established operational model enables it to reach and acquire more nonprogrammers because of its large geographic footprint. Many sales leads are likely stationed on or near Cintas current delivery routes. The marginal cost to serve a new customer is far lower for Cintas with its existing size versus that of smaller competitors. Hence, Cintas maintains superior operating margins of above 20%, which is over 1,500 basis points higher than its closest peer Unifirst. We believe this margin advantage is mainly cost-driven as opposed to benefiting from potential price premium, given that Cintas (alike other industry players) has limited pricing power, because uniforms are largely commodified apparel products with little opportunity for differentiation.We assign Cintas first aid and safety segment a narrow moat based on scale-based cost advantages. Cintas personnel delivers and installs first aid kits and personal protective equipment, or PPE, and comes back to restock and inspect on a regular basis. Like its core uniform rental segment, this workflow requires ongoing customer touch points, which incurs higher labor and fuel expenses. This is where we see the positive effects of route density and proximity to customers spill over to the firm's ancillary business segments. Given its expansive infrastructure, Cintas can earn more profit on its routes by serving each customer multiple products and service lines while saving on transportation costs. The firm has been focusing on customer penetration, creating sales teams specifically designated to upsell to existing customers. Cintas broad range of premium stock-keeping units, or SKUs, like Carhartt and Automated External Defibrillator, allows Cintas to increase sales, while lowering the unit cost to efficiently serve customers. In short, upselling gives Cintas economies of scope.We assign Cintas all other segment, which includes Fire Protection Services (FPS) and Direct Uniform Sales (DUS), a narrow moat. Economies of scope is exhibited here as well, given the sales teams focus on upselling across all business segments of the firm. Moreover, FPS is entirely service based; Cintas neither provides nor installs fire protection systems, only inspects them. Its costs come mainly from compensating inspectors and transportation costs. Its asset-light nature provides ample opportunity for Cintas to increase revenues without much additional cost, strengthening its company-wide cost advantage while maintaining its brand image as a one-stop-shop. However, we acknowledge that competition in this segment is too high for Cintas to earn a wide moat, as most fire protection systems providers offer their own inspection services. For DUS, customers such as hotels and casinos work with Cintas to customize uniforms for staffs. DUS likely shares many operational facilities and delivery trucks with the uniform rental business given their commonalities in dealing with the same materials and supplies. These synergies decrease the average total cost of operations. We think it is very unlikely smaller competitors and new entrants can replicate these distribution efficiencies and displace Cintas. The firm boasts an annual customer retention that hovers around 95%, with many customer relationships enduring an average of over 20 years. Additionally, at about a quarter of its total customer base, Cintas claims even higher customer retention rates (99%) for its national account customers, who typically sign multi-year contracts at a national level, mandating its regional locations to use Cintas' services. Cintas' expansive route infrastructure across regions in the U.S. enables the firm to capture these higher-value customers. ","Cintas' core uniform and ancillary products business is highly exposed to U.S. employment trends. When coupled with the fixed-cost nature of route-based operations (including the need for truck fleets and processing facilities), these factors make for cyclical financial performance. The firm has responded admirably to past recessions, but periods of economic weakness will nonetheless weigh heavily on its top line, while cutting into operating margins. There is still a great deal of uncertainty around the business' resilience amid recent recessionary pressures.Additionally, the uniform rental industry is fragmented and relatively mature, with nearly 600 smaller players other than the big names Aramark and UniFirst. Acquisitions have long been a central component of Cintas growth strategy; the firm acquires local, smaller competitors to expand its customer base and number of routes. Given the large G&K Services acquisition and the fact that additional deals are likely over the long run as the industry gradually consolidates, the risk of overpayment or integration complications will remain a factor.From our perspective, Cintas does not face any material environmental, social, and governance risks that may pose a substantial threat to economic profit at midcycle. The most probable risks surround human capital through wage increases or employee unionization efforts and data privacy and security. Cintas relies on cloud-based software and its transition to SAP software continues. There have been very few issues with SAP over the past few quarters, and we expect this will continue as it concludes the process. With regard to a potential data breach, we believe Cintas is at no greater risk than other firms in the uniform rental space. While a breach is possible, we do not find it probable and therefore maintain a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.","We assess the capital allocation of Cintas as Standard. We believe its balance sheet is sound, its investment strategies are fair, and its distribution strategies are appropriate.Cintas' management team is highly experienced and tenured. Scott Farmer retired as CEO in May 2021 after serving for 18 years and remains an executive chair. Todd Schneider succeeded Farmer as CEO and president and joined the board of directors in June 2021. Schneider has been with Cintas for over 32 years and was previously president and Chief Operating Officer of the flagship uniform rental business segment, which has performed admirably in recent years, while successfully integrating G&K's vast uniform operations. He also had been companywide COO responsible for operations and marketing since 2018. Mike Hansen took over the CFO slot in early 2015 following the retirement of Bill Gale, who held the role for 19 years. Hansen joined Cintas in 1995 and was previously vice president and treasurer.Management has a very respectable record of execution, and we rate its investment strategies as fair. The firm successfully navigated the 2008-09 economic downturn by slashing costs and rightsizing its distribution network to match anemic demand. During the 2009 recession, Cintas uniform revenue was about 5% lower than nonfarm payroll for one year, but it had returned to the 300-basis-point lead three quarters later. In fact, Cintas continued to post positive economic profit in its fiscal 2010 despite the challenging operating environment. Management implemented similar successful measures in navigating the COVID-19 environment as during the Great Recession. That said, Cintas is not without a few blunders. Over the past decade, the company has diversified its service portfolio into new end markets to boost its growth profile, namely document management, first-aid/safety supplies, and fire protection services. However, not all of these forays have performed as planned, as evidenced by its decision in early 2014 to deconsolidate its document shredding operations into a joint venture, which was subsequently divested (fourth quarter of 2015). In general, document shredding is a commoditized business with entrenched competitors, providing few opportunities to differentiate. Cintas paid $4.60 in dividends per share in fiscal 2023, up from $3.80 in fiscal 2022. Quarterly dividend declarations indicate the firm will continue to grow its dividend payout. Given the firm's strong cash position, we believe this is an appropriate use of funds. Cintas scaled back on share repurchases during fiscal 2017 and 2018 due to the large G&K acquisition. Afterward, buybacks ramped back up, with the firm repurchasing about $550 million in 2021 and about $1.5 billion in 2022. Cintas maintained relatively low capital expenditure at slightly over $200 million for the past three years, but has increased to over $300 million in fiscal 2023. During the pandemic, the firm paused growth-related capital expenditures to focus on maintenance-related capital expenditures, like servicing its existing truck fleet. As COVID-19 restrictions completely go away, we project capital spending to increase. Cintas' emphasis on technology investments and its centralized informational technology team implies higher capital expenditures in the upcoming years. These technology investments aim at process improvement to deliver a better and more consistent customer experience, like the MyCintasPortal, which offers 24/7 eService, and a more convenient ordering procedure. As management explains, this is only the beginning phase of its technological transformation. ","Cintas is positioned as a one-stop-shop that rents/sells uniforms and ancillary products and services, such as mops, first aid kits, and fire inspections. In its core uniform and facility services unit (a majority of sales), Cintas provides uniform rental programs for items including but not limited to office attire, custom tailored apparel, flame-resistant clothing, lab coats, and other profession-specific clothing. Facilities products generally include the rental and sale of entrance mat, mops, shop towels, hand sanitizers, and restroom supplies. In addition, Cintas' remaining business includes a first aid and safety services business, a fire protection services business, and a uniform direct sales business.","The industry in which Cintas operates is a cyclical one, yet on a normalized basis, we believe Cintas will more likely than not post positive economic profits over the next 20 years. Adjusted returns on invested capital averaged 19% over the past three years compared with our 8.5% weighted average cost of capital projected average for the next five years. We expect adjusted ROIC will average around 25% over the next five years, assuming improved to steady U.S. employment conditions in our base-case scenario.Furthermore, margins in the core uniform and facility services division consistently surpass the uniform divisions in its closest competitors. In fiscal 2023, Cintas achieved gross margins of over 47%, which is over twice that of Aramark's. Its operating margins are more notable: Cintas maintained superior operating margins of over 20%, contrasted with UniFirst and Aramark operating in the mid-single-digits range. We think this is a reflection of healthy network investment and solid sales execution, coupled with benefits from scale-based cost advantages. We consider Cintas' balance sheet to be healthy. As of the end of fiscal 2023 (ended May 31), the firm has no variable debt. Cintas' debt/EBITDA is 1.1 times at the end of fiscal 2023, versus 1.4 times at the end of fiscal 2022. Management expects continual solid cash flow and is on the outlook for potential M&A opportunities if they are to arise in the years ahead.",CTAS,Industrials,56870043648.0,NMS,278874.0,USD,554.9000244140625,True,0,506.30423763499164,598.8814630275768,1
24/11/2023,"Waters' Wide Moat Intact, Despite Biopharma Spending Delays",Waters Corp,WAT,4,07/11/2023,Julie Utterback,276.33,USD,23/11/2023,323.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,B,07/11/2023,"Wide-moat Waters reported weak China demand in the third quarter that was more than offset by margin expansion on the bottom line. However, continued China and currency challenges caused management to push down its 2023 sales and adjusted EPS guidance a bit. At first glance, this reduction in 2023 expectations does not materially affect our $323 fair value estimate, though, and shares look moderately undervalued. In the quarter, Waters reported a constant-currency revenue decline of 4%, which was on the low end of expectations and included weak demand in China while other geographies grew in the low single digits. Easily delayed instrument sales remained the culprit for the quarter's weakness, declining 13% year over year, while recurring revenue grew 4% in constant currency. Instrument sales could eventually rebound as sentiment improves in key end markets, especially given Waters strong new product portfolio that is supporting higher prices. With significant gross margin expansion and other cost controls causing operating margins to rise 380 basis points in the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 8% year over year to $2.84 in the third quarter, or well above management's previous expectation for $2.50-$2.60. Near-term uncertainty in China and currency headwinds caused management to reduce its 2023 expectations, though. Specifically, Waters now expects a constant currency sales decline of 1% to 2%, down from 0.5%-1.5% growth previously, and adjusted EPS of $11.65 to $11.75, down from $12.20-$12.30 previously. This lower 2023 earnings guidance includes a larger China headwind than expecteda potential sales decline around 25% in 2023 versus a low-double-digit decline expected previouslyand 250 basis points of additional currency headwinds on earnings than anticipated previously. While we have tinkered with our near-term expectations, our long-term views for Waters and the life science industry remain intact, and shares appear attractively valued to us.","Waters' analytical instruments remain the gold standard in several applications, especially LC-MS for pharmaceutical firms, where regulations preserve consistent recurring sales for many years. Historically, Waters has maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy that has preserved returns on invested capital near the top of the industry, and we expect that to continue even if acquisitions increase somewhat. Waters continues to benefit from expanding branded and generic biopharmaceuticals and the increase in food safety and environmental testing by various entities.","Waters remains an extremely focused organization, which creates the potential for cash flow variability if its products fall out of favor or if its end markets face disruption. Competition from the likes of Agilent and Thermo Fisher, among others, puts consistent pressure on Waters to innovate.  Market share losses under the old management team may be difficult to recapture even for the company's new management team.",31/05/2023,"Waters' tools help clients perform scientific research by providing analytical instruments, services, and supplies. The company specializes in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products (nearly 90% of sales), which are used primarily by pharmaceutical firms to analyze a molecules structure during the drug discovery, development, and production processes. These tools can also be used in food and environmental quality testing as well as other industrial applications. Additionally, Waters helps scientists examine the physical properties of various materials through its thermal analysis tools (low-double digits percentage).  The firm's strategy revolves around placing instruments, including preinstalled software, providing various services throughout each system's useful life, and selling related consumables, such as chromatography columns and sample preparation kits and tools. About half of Waters' sales are considered recurring, but even instrument sales can be relatively sticky, especially in the highly regulated pharmaceutical end market, which represents about 60% of Waters' sales. We appreciate Waters' concentration in this highly regulated space, which is more significant than many of its life science/diagnostic peers, given the healthy long-term growth profile and significant switching costs associated with the pharmaceutical field. However, Waters growth has underperformed expectations in recent years, which resulted in a change in management including new CEO, Udit Batra, who highlighted several areas to improve when he started in September 2020. For example, Waters is now focused on upgrading older liquid chromatography instruments with newer systems, highlighting the lack of urgency in the selling organization under the previous management team. Also, when Batra started in September 2020, Waters sold only 20% of its consumables online, which is sharply below peers that typically sell about 50% of consumables online, and has been deemed an area to improve upon. Additionally, Waters trails peers in terms of penetrating the contract research organization channel in pharmaceuticals, and it is focused on gaining share in that part of the end market.","We believe a wide moat surrounds Waters analytical instrument business, consisting of liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and thermal analysis tools. Intellectual property and ongoing innovation create an intangible asset moat source, while regulatory and reproducibility factors contribute to switching costs for end users. Both moat sources are crucial to Waters advantages in its target markets, and with these advantages, Waters enjoys profitability near the top of the life science market, with returns on invested capital over 25%, by our calculations.Waters offers differentiated technology that is protected by various intangible assets, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks. This portfolio of intellectual property and its innovation prowess keep competitors from directly copying its technology. Since even slightly differentiated technical features can cause an end user to prefer one tool over another similar tool in Waters precise scientific end markets, intangible assets around its differentiated technology are a significant moat source. The differentiated properties of Waters tools affect the performance, accuracy, and speed of the various projects they enable, and differentiated product features create intangible assets that inform decisions to use those tools in specific applications, particularly at the beginning of a project. To remain relevant to scientists in early project phases, Waters must continue to innovate, and that ability to innovate contributes to its intangible assets in this business, as well. After the initial choice of its tools based on intangible assets, Waters benefits from substantial switching costs in most of its end markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals which accounts for nearly 60% of Waters revenue. In this end market, Waters analytical tools are critical components of the production methods for various drugs, which are specified directly in each molecules regulatory approval application. Regulators require the same production method for each drug, unless updated with regulators, which would add time, money, and regulatory scrutiny to the production process that most end users (drugmakers) do not want. With those regulatory factors and other reproducibility and employee training factors, Waters benefits from significant switching costs for its pharmaceutical customers that can lead to decades-worth of demand for its tools. In the branded phase of a small molecule drug's life, that period can last roughly 20 years from discovery until patent expiration. For large molecules (or biologics), that period can last even longer because of the difficult manufacturing process. Also, once a drugs key patents expire, generic and biosimilar manufacturers often try to mimic the same production methods as the branded manufacturer to reduce product variability, and that adoption by generic and biosimilar manufacturers can create an even longer benefit period for Waters if a molecule remains in demand by consumers. Overall, Waters concentration in the highly regulated biopharmaceutical end market extends the prospects for economic profits over a such a long period that we view Waters as a wide-moat firm, which compares favorably to the many narrow-moat life sciences and diagnostic companies that typically enjoy less concentration in this regulated field.We see narrower, but still strong, moats around Waters others end markets, such as material science, food, and environmental applications due to less-intense regulatory requirements, but intangible assets and switching costs support Waters moat in most of those end markets, as well. Throughout its operations, Waters analytical instruments have long useful lives (typically five to seven years), and Waters often benefits from a razor-and-blade business model during that life cycle. About half of the companys revenue is recurring (consumables and services), while the other half is generated from one-time sales (instruments and informatics). Pricing power for the organization appears positive overall, with annual price appreciation primarily from consumables and services. Waters has noted that its pricing power rises with the regulation of its end markets, which correlates well with our view of the wider moat in pharmaceutical applications compared with its other end markets. We think that relates to the interoperability of Waters consumable products, including chromatography columns, on competitive instrumentation. Therefore, in less regulated markets, the end users are more sensitive to technological differences and pricing on related products and services during and at the end of an instruments life cycle than in more regulated markets. However, we think some reproducibility- and training-related switching costs are present in most of Waters end markets, even if they are not as highly regulated as the pharmaceutical business.","We give Waters a medium uncertainty rating thanks to its sticky end markets, especially biopharmaceuticals, that should result in relatively steady demand trends, despite more variability in its other major end marketsindustrials and academic/government. Notably, though, about half of the company's sales come from system placements, which can be delayed or even canceled in challenging conditions. For example, industrial clients may choose to stretch out the use of existing systems rather than purchase new instruments in an economic downturn, and we saw that dynamic play out during the early days of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Also, if pharmaceutical development projects fail or end-market dynamics change, such as what we saw in the Chinese generic pharmaceutical market in early 2019, system purchases may fall even in the steady biopharmaceutical end market. Significant constraints on government research budgets could depress spending among academic and government customers, too. Additionally, Waters remains a technology company that must innovate or acquire new businesses to remain relevant. If established competitors or new entrants introduce better products or develop stronger relationships with customers, the company may lose market share as well as its ability to extract price increases. Also, much of the value in Waters stems from the intellectual property of its employee base, which creates an ESG risk if there is ever a brain drain at the firm.","Our capital allocation rating for Waters remains Exemplary, although some uncertainty surrounds the company's capital allocation strategy under new management and we think its score is on the edge of Exemplary and Standard. The firm's balance sheet management is sound, its investment strategy is on the edge of exceptional and standard, and its distribution record is mixed.CEO Udit Batra joined the team in September 2020. We think his wealth of experience leading Merck KGaA's life sciences segment will be particularly valuable in his new role. We generally view this change in leadership positively for Waters, which had been suffering from lackluster results especially compared with peers for years probably due to an underinvestment in its technology and a lack of urgency in its commercial operations under its previous management team. However, Batra's executive experience at Merck KGaA and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering look like a good fit with Waters. At Merck KGaA, Batra was the key leader in its life science operations from 2014 to 2020, and his experiences include the integration of the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition in 2015. Merck's life science segment, particularly its bioprocessing solutions division, has been a key driver of the company's growth in recent years. Investors in Waters' stock will hope Batra can help the company return to high-quality growth on both the top and bottom lines after the previous management team relied too heavily on financial engineering to boost the bottom line, in our opinion. Positively, Waters did not make any return-reducing acquisition errors during the previous management team's tenure, so we think the new management team has a pretty good foundation to begin reinvesting in the business again through either internal or external means. Therefore, we lean toward exceptional (rather than a standard) score in the investment category, for now, while the new management team continues to make progress on its growth initiatives.The company maintains a very healthy balance sheet that could arguably stand a bit more leverage, especially if it can use financing to invest in novel technology to get the bottomline moving in a high-quality fashion, rather than the financial engineering that was prevalent under the previous management team. We would also highlight that Waters' distribution strategy is mixed. The focus on repurchases while shares appear overvalued to us during the recent life science boom probably did not create a lot of value. Also, we think the business is mature enough and durable enough to consider paying a dividend, something it does not do now.","Water sells liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and thermal analysis tools. These analytical instruments provide essential information on various products, such as their molecular structures and physical properties, to help clients enhance the health and well-being of end users. As a percentage of sales in 2022, Waters generated 59% from pharmaceutical customers, 31% from industrial clients, and 10% from academic/government institutions.","Prior to the new management team joining in 2020 the company aimed for net debt/EBITDA of 2.5 times after U.S. tax reform gave it easy access to cash held overseas, which contributed to a strategy of pursuing debt-funded share repurchases. While the company's leverage remains well below that target (around 1 times) and the company suspended its share-repurchase activity in 2020 because of the COVID-19 crisis, management ramped up repurchases in 2021 and 2022 at rich prices, in our opinion. Waters does not pay a dividend, and it has not made large acquisitions in recent years. Beyond that, management said in early 2021 it aims to invest for growth (perhaps through tuck-in acquisitions like the recent Wyatt deal), maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders. With only about $1.5 billion in debt at last count compared with $1.2 billion in cash and investments, Waters maintains a financially flexible balance sheet, in our view.",WAT,Healthcare,17078834176.0,NYQ,466362.0,USD,276.3299865722656,True,1,268.34458725873174,320.66123491451975,1
24/11/2023,CarMax Will Keep Battling Expensive Inventory Procurement and Consumer Affordability in Fiscal 2024,CarMax Inc,KMX,5,17/11/2023,David Whiston,63.86,USD,23/11/2023,135.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,17/11/2023,"At the Los Angeles auto show on Nov. 16, Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon in which, starting next year, some of its dealers will sell new vehicles on Amazon.com. The news sent each of the six franchise dealers and CarMax down about 5%-8%, which we think is a large overreaction predicated on fears of Amazon taking share away from dealers. Such a risk is not even possible on new vehicle sales due to state franchise laws, nor do we think it is likely that Amazon wants to do all aspects of auto retailing such as handling and disposing of trade-ins, service, and finance and insurance offerings. Service is a very underappreciated benefit that dealers provide customers when comparing the traditional auto industry to digital retailing and electric vehicle startups' direct sales formats. Should Amazon directly sell used vehicles someday, CarMax would have more competition, but it also has the ability to sell via brick-and-mortar, digital-only, or any combination of both depending on what the customer wants, something a digital-only retailer cannot offer. Our auto coverage has been implementing omnichannel tools for years and we doubt that any of their management teams are surprised by the Amazon news. Details, especially around economics, are thin, but Automotive News cited a Hyundai spokesperson who said starting in January, only 18 Hyundai dealers will partner with Amazon, with that number expanding in the second half of the year. Prominent LA auto dealer Mike Sullivan joined Hyundai and Amazon in the presentation to say the dealer will still be the seller of record and reiterated other customer benefits that dealers provide like services. Its possible this arrangement is a larger version of Costcos auto program that provides members the ability to buy a new or used vehicle from over 3,000 dealers of various brands.","CarMax has increased revenue and profitability at a remarkable rate, and we think it is positioned to gain market share in any environment. Omnichannel helps this story, as it lets consumer have maximum flexibility in their experience. In April 2022, CarMax announced aggressive growth plans to reach about $33 billion-$45 billion of revenue in fiscal 2026 and be the online leader in used-vehicle retailing. No competitors have successfully duplicated CarMax's business model, providing the company with a considerable head start on would-be imitators.","CarMax operates in a cyclical industry, and its strong model is not immune to a recession. In the past, the company was not free cash flow positive as new store openings ramped up, but we think investing today to outearn the cost of capital is worth it. In recent times outside the chip-shortage years, the company has generated strong free cash flow and ROIC despite opening new stores. Some of the largest franchise auto dealers are trying to replicate CarMax's success with their own stand-alone used-vehicle stores, and startups such as Carvana are also competition.",17/04/2023,"CarMax's revenue has increased at a compound annual rate of about 12.5% since fiscal 2000 because of the success of customer-friendly sales practices and use of information technology. The firm targets fiscal 2026 revenue between $33 billion and $45 billion with over 5% zero to 10-year-old vehicle market share by end of calendar 2025, up from 4% in 2022. Competing dealerships have tried no-haggle pricing and failed because their salesforces are trained to focus on selling vehicles that earn the highest possible gross profit rather than vehicles that customers actually want or need. A traditional dealership relies on profits from service to offset the typically lower margins it gets on new-vehicle sales. CarMax does not hire salespeople from the auto industry, and salespeople receive the same commission regardless of the vehicle sold. They do not even know the profit on the vehicle sold. The CarMax customer stays with the same salesperson throughout the transaction rather than being passed off to a finance department, receiving a buying experience that is hard to match at a dealership. This focus on customer satisfaction, combined with scale advantages that allow for a wide inventory selection and extensive pricing data, creates a narrow economic moat. Management has said repeatedly that it will give any further improvements in operating expenses back to the customer as a price decrease instead of seeking higher gross margins. We like this strategy; CarMax's scale allows it to price below smaller dealerships, and lowering prices should increase comparable-store sales while keeping competitors away, though some large dealers are copying CarMax's shopping experience. The company can often make up any lost margin via its highly profitable finance arm, CarMax Auto Finance. CAF finances about 42% of unit sales. The company's omnichannel program enables consumers to shop in any combination of digital and in store that they like and should allow for fewer store openings over time. These factors should keep the company growing for many years, despite more competition from franchised dealers and online-only startups. Omnichannel is just over half of retail volume.","CarMax is the used-vehicle expert. It has retailed about 12 million vehicles, wholesaled about 7.5 million, and appraised roughly 40 million through fiscal 2023. This expertise allows it to retail more than 99% of the vehicles that go on the lot. CarMax has two of the five moat sources in our economic moat framework: intangible assets and cost advantage. Many things about CarMaxs moat are replicable in theory, but we see them as difficult to copy well. CarMax's intangible asset moat source stems from its strong brand equity and valuable cache of historical auto pricing and lending data. CarMax is the largest used-vehicle retailer in the world with a very well-recognized brand that is known for its no-haggle selling process, excellent customer service, superior inventory selection, and convenient financing and delivery options. CarMax's selling process is unique compared with dealers. For example, sales associates are paid a flat commission regardless of the vehicle sold. In our view, this method properly aligns the salesperson's incentives with the needs of the customer. Franchise dealers have tried the no-haggle approach in the past but have not always been successful because their salespeople pursue deals with high gross profit. A CarMax customer also works with the same salesperson for financing rather than being passed off to a finance manager like at a franchise dealer. CarMax's selling process is transparent, with the customer seeing the same information on a screen as the CarMax associate, which makes the process less adversarial.Franchise dealers such as Sonic and Asbury began emulating this format in 2014 but had to start from scratch with stand-alone used-vehicle stores under new brands (EchoPark and Q Auto), so we do not see any new player as a formidable threat to CarMax. Asbury terminated its Q Auto brand in 2017, and Lithia Motors' L2 used-only stores that did not survive the Great Recession. AutoNation (AutoNation USA) and Penske Automotive Group (CarShop) have joined the stand-alone used-vehicle store fight with EchoPark, but we think the market is fragmented enough that CarMax, the franchise dealers, and new digital-only players like Carvana, Shift, and Vroom can all find success if they execute right.The brand does not just help CarMax sell vehicles, it helps the company best source them as well. In fiscal 2022 for example, the number of vehicles CarMax purchased from consumers increased 95.5% from fiscal 2021 to over 1.4 million, with about half of those vehicles purchased online, something we don't think a one- or two-store dealer can do without massive IT investment or a brand as powerful as CarMax's name. Fiscal 2023 vehicles bought from consumers fell to 1.1 million as overall company retail unit volume fell 12.6% year over year because of consumers struggling with used vehicle affordability. Vehicles purchased from a consumer tend to have higher gross profit per unit when retailed than vehicles bought at auctions, and the percentage of CarMax's retail unit sales that it bought from consumers (what it calls its self-sufficiency ratio) is now at record levels of over 70%, up from 30%-40% before the pandemic. We see this increase as the result of online vehicle commerce becoming more common but also CarMax's digital efforts, such as effective internet marketing, its instant online appraisal tool, and the growth of the firms customer experience call centers. CarMax also says the buy rate (the portion of vehicles offered by consumers to CarMax who agree to sell to CarMax) is higher for customers in the instant appraisal tool than in the traditional appraisal channel, though it doesn't say by how much. This means that CarMaxs brand and tech capability with an online instant appraisal tool help it source inventory that will likely be more profitable than that sourced from an auction.We view CarMax's big data advantage as an intangible asset, as well. CarMax's sales and appraisal data goes back to its founding in 1993 as part of now-defunct Circuit City. This data cannot be purchased by a competitor. CarMax uses the data to arm its buyers with the best information on vehicle auction pricing and appraisal value. The data is also used to develop a national pricing algorithm, which helps CarMax retail more than 99% of the vehicles offered through its stores. We believe CarMax's data advantage results in stronger profitability compared with competitors. Based on our analysis, CarMax posts higher used-vehicle profit than nearly all of the six publicly traded franchise dealers. We believe its data edge has helped CarMax maintain its gross profit per retail unit at about $2,100-$2,200 despite changes in average selling price. In our view, CarMax's data advantage will be needed as more competitors enter the sector. This edge in purchasing is a huge intangible asset, in our view, but also somewhat of a cost advantage because the data enables CarMax to optimally pay for inventory while also optimally pricing a vehicle for sale once on the lot.In our view, CarMax's size and large store base give it an advantage over smaller competitors. A small used-car lot operation or one- or two-store franchise dealers cannot cost-effectively move inventory around a large geographic area the way CarMax can. In fiscal 2022, about 36% of CarMax's unit volume came from consumers transferring a vehicle, which can be done for no fee if the vehicle is close to the customer or a few thousand dollars if shipped from far away. The ability for CarMax to ship nearly any of its typically over 50,000 (but as much as over 70,000) vehicles in inventory at its over 230 stores to anywhere in the U.S. gives the customer superior selection versus a small retailer. The benefits of CarMax's size help the brand, which management strengthened in January 2021 with the launch of the Love Your Car Guarantee. This entailed the company increasing its money-back guarantee (to return a vehicle for any reason) to 30 days and 1,500 miles from seven days, better than Carvana's seven-day guarantee, and also introduced a 24-hour test drive policy. We believe CarMax's information systems and captive finance arm differentiate the firm from its competitors, although these capabilities can be replicated. In terms of information systems, most dealers use prepackaged software that is geared to the multifaceted operations of a franchise dealer. CarMax developed its own dealer management system software in the 1990s. It is the only large dealer that uses a DMS tailored to a used-vehicle retailer; prepackaged software generally meets the manufacturers' needs. The firm is also using its IT capability to test finance-based shopping enhancements such as customers prequalifying for a loan without affecting their credit score and already offers capabilities such as offering personalized loan terms from multiple lenders for any vehicle.CarMax also has a cost advantage tied to its reconditioning operations. The company's size allows it to invest in single-piece-flow (production line) reconditioning facilities using Toyota operational expertise. This method has increased efficiency and lowered reconditioning costs per vehicle, which in turn raises gross profit per vehicle sold. The company lowered reconditioning costs by about $250 per vehicle under this process. Also, as with our franchise dealer coverage, CarMaxs size brings scale around purchasing for things such as health insurance and advertising costs.The wholesale business has grown significantly to become 21% of total gross profit in fiscal 2023, up from 14% in fiscal 2017. CarMax is one of the largest vehicle auction companies in the U.S. CarMax's size and appraisal channel with consumers allow it to source tremendous amounts of used-vehicle inventory. This large inventory results in a high dealer/car ratio at the auction, which keeps pricing up. CarMax also holds auctions at least weekly, which helps its retail business as the company can better understand what is in demand. The company's pricing knowledge and large inventory (that is not auctioned on consignment so it always sells) help CarMax sell about 95% of the vehicles it brings to auction, compared with 60% at other large auction firms per management. The end result of this process is usually immense wholesale profit for CarMax relative to other dealers, though not in fiscal 2022 because of higher procurement costs. For example, in fiscal 2023, the company's wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,008 and wholesale gross margin was 9.8% (down from 15.9% in fiscal 2021). This compares with AutoNation, the second largest new-vehicle dealer, which had wholesale gross margin of 2.3% in calendar 2022.CarMax Auto Finance is special because most other dealers rely on the automakers' captive finance arms to extend credit to consumers. CAF enables incremental volume for CarMax as opposed to relying on external lending partners and enables nearly any customer who wants a loan to get one. CAF allows CarMax to sell loans to a bankrupt-remote special-purpose entity called the warehouse. CarMax then uses that cash for any corporate purpose, such as buying more inventory. The finance arm thus reduces some of CarMax's debt needs while also contributing significant profit. Before interest rates rose sharply in 2022, the company was recording an average profit across the whole CAF portfolio by our calculation of over $2,000 per loan (over the life of the loan) compared with a pre-Great Recession average of $600-$900 per loan. In early 2023, we calculate a per loan profit of about $1,150 due to interest margin compression. A typical loan maturity is about 66-67 months and about 60 months by the time the loan is securitized. A startup would have to establish a large finance arm to match CarMax's EBIT margin, which would take time and expense. We've heard franchise dealer executives at firms we cover say they are not interested in the time, cost, and regulatory hassle of setting up a finance arm, with the exception of Lithia Motors and AutoNation, but CarMax's loan receivables book is already over $16 billion and it originated $8.8 billion in loans just in fiscal 2023. This is a lead that may never be matched, in our view. We think the dealer sector is the best business in the automotive supply chain. The firms do not have large fixed cost bases because they are not manufacturers and have no burdensome retiree expenses, and as a used-vehicle retailer, CarMax does not rely on one brand. The company offers consumers great selection with as much as over 50,000 vehicles available nationwide for transfer to any store. An average CarMax store has nearly as many as 350 vehicles on the lot, while a traditional dealer will have just 30-100 vehicles.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is High. CarMax operates in the cyclical auto industry, and any downturn brings uncertainty as to the timing and extent of a recovery in demand for used vehicles. Also, nothing stops a competitor from trying to emulate CarMax; Lithia Motors' and Asbury's now-defunct L2 and Q Auto used-car stores are proof of that, as are AutoNation USA, Sonic's EchoPark, and Penske's CarShop stores. In 2013, franchise vehicle dealer Sonic announced plans to open its EchoPark stand-alone used-vehicle stores, which it did in 2014. Sonic wants to have a lot of stores over time and made it clear how much it admires CarMax. The industry is so fragmented that all these firms may find success, though we think competitors will need at least a decade to rival CarMax in size and expertise. When used-vehicle prices rise, management will likely keep the same target for gross profit dollars, which can hurt margin and cash flow as in fiscal 2022-23. We think highly of CarMax's management and business model, so we consider macroeconomic variables as the highest risk for the firm rather than company-specific risk factors.We dont see any major environmental, social, and governance concerns for CarMax, provided that autonomous vehicles do not someday eliminate demand for used vehicles. We think that is highly unlikely, due to vehicle affordability for all Americans, and even if it occurred, its likely a long way off. The company does get sued from time to time for accusations of unpaid wages or unfair labor practices, but we dont see any of these matters ever receiving a judgment that would drastically reduce our fair value estimate. CarMax will need to ensure that its data security measures are ironclad as it moves into the omnichannel space with its customers sharing more personal information. Governance improvements in the past are that the board allowed the shareholder rights plan to expire in 2012 and removed the staggered board of director terms in 2013.","We award CarMax a Standard capital allocation rating based on its balance sheet health, investment choices, and shareholder distributions. The balance sheet is normally in great shape, but about $2 billion in new debt came on the books in fiscal 2022 to combat the cash burn for acquiring expensive inventory resulting from the pandemic and chip shortage. We expected debt to come down once inventory acquisition costs fell, and we like that management fully repaid the $1.2 billion revolver draw during fiscal 2023. CarMax Auto Finance enables CarMax to have less debt than itd otherwise need to fund growth and omnichannel investments. Debt maturities are mostly a few years out in time with major debt due of $100 million of 3.86% bonds in April 2023 and a $300 million term loan that matures in June 2024. After those obligations, there is $400 million due from two bond offerings with maturities spread out equally in April 2026 and April 2028. A new $700 million term loan due in October 2026 was drawn in fiscal 2022's third quarter to help fund expensive inventory purchases. Liquidity at the end of fiscal 2023 is solid, with about $2 billion available on the credit line plus $314.8 million in cash. CAFs over $16.3 billion of asset-backed security notes payable remain on the balance sheet but are nearly entirely offset by notes receivables and are nonrecourse to CarMax. We model robust free cash flow generation of about $1.1 billion-$1.7 billion a year starting in fiscal 2026 and nearly $900 million of free cash flow combined across fiscal 2024-25.CarMax wisely has not fought consumers' move to e-commerce and instead invested heavily the past few years in omnichannel capabilities based on its information technology and customer experience centers. These centers can enable customers to never come to a store if they do not want to. We think CarMax remains competitive as more digital-only competitors like Carvana emerge, but also as the public franchise dealers such as AutoNation, Sonic, and Penske now have their own stand-alone used-vehicle stores. Other auto dealers have greatly expanded their digital shopping abilities even if they dont have stand-alone used-vehicle stores. Lithia Motors Driveway, Asbury's Clicklane, and Group 1's AcceleRide brands are a great example of that. CarMaxs competitive landscape has never been more crowded than it is now, in our view, but we see the firm remaining a leader thanks to its head start in data collection since 1993 and its industry-leading 30-day money-back guarantee. Also, the used-vehicle marketplace of about 40 million units a year in the U.S. is still highly fragmented despite so much new competition.CarMax's return on invested capital has been strong, in the midteens to 20% range, and we model high teens starting in fiscal 2026 after modest economic loss in fiscal 2024-25. The exception to strong ROIC was fiscal 2009 (during the financial crisis), where it was only about 4% and about 6.5% in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2021 with the pandemic still had a ROIC of about 12%, by our calculation. Although the company does not pay a dividend and until fiscal 2013 had not repurchased its shares, we think that is the correct decision as shareholders benefit from cash funding new stores and omnichannel growth. Since October 2012, the company has announced multiple share-repurchase programs. At year-end fiscal 2023, management had reduced the diluted share count by 31% since the end of fiscal 2013, and we expect buybacks to continue. The authorization had $2.45 billion left at the end of fiscal 2023 and does not expire. In first quarter of fiscal 2023, the board increased the authorization by $2 billion, so we expect share repurchases to continue. Buybacks had occurred in every quarter since they began in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, except for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. In December 2022 the company announced it is pausing buybacks to keep cash on hand, which is prudent; however, we hope it is not a long pause because we see the stock as quite undervalued as of 2023. We like seeing share repurchases but only when the stock is trading well below our fair value estimate. We also like that balancing new store growth with digital expansion is a top, if not the top, management priority, and we do not expect that to change other than in a severe recession. CarMax is an outstanding operator, in our opinion, but is still in a highly cyclical industry. Outside of recessions, we would rather the company reinvest in the business while stockpiling cash in anticipation of buying back large amounts of shares during what would probably be an outstanding buying opportunity in a downturn, such as when the pandemic started in early 2020 or in 2023. Management suspended the program in March 2020 when the pandemic started but resumed it in September 2020 as conditions improved.","CarMax sells, finances, and services used and new cars through a chain of about 240 used retail stores. It was formed in 1993 as a unit of Circuit City and spun off into an independent company in late 2002. Used-vehicle sales typically account for about 83% of revenue (78% in fiscal 2023 due to the chip shortage) and wholesale about 13% (20% in fiscal 2023), with the remaining portion composed of extended service plans and repair. In fiscal 2023, the company retailed and wholesaled 807,823, and 585,071 used vehicles, respectively. CarMax is the largest used-vehicle retailer in the U.S. but still estimates that it has only about 4% U.S. market share of vehicles 0-10 years old in 2022. It seeks over 5% share by the end of calendar 2025. CarMax is based in Richmond, Virginia.","We think CarMax has the liquidity to fight the pandemic and supply chain issues and also fund store expansion. We think there is an ample real estate base to do sale-leasebacks or borrow against if more capital is ever needed, since we calculate CarMax owns about 65% of its stores. CarMax also received an increase on its credit limit in summer 2008, despite the terrible auto sales climate. CarMax's $2 billion credit line expires in June 2024. At the end of fiscal 2023, the line was undrawn. Throughout fiscal 2022, the firm did borrow from the line to help buy expensive inventory and took on a $700 million term loan in the fiscal third quarter to support inventory expansion. There is a $100 million bond maturity in April 2023. June 2024 brings a $300 million term loan and a $200 million bond matures in April 2026. The second term loan for $699.5 million is due in October 2026.CAF allows CarMax to take on less debt than with a traditional line of credit arrangement. Net debt/EBITDA was about 1.7 times in fiscal 2023 with the credit line, term loans, and $500 million spread across three senior unsecured notes due in April 2023, 2026, and 2028 making up most of the debt outside of CAF notes payable. CAF notes are nonrecourse to CarMax. In 2014, the board authorized the firm taking on up to $1 billion of new debt, mostly for buybacks. The company took out the $300 million term loan after the authorization, and in fiscal 2017, it issued the three tranches of $500 million of senior unsecured notes. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we calculate that CarMax's balance sheet held a net debt position of $1.7 billion, up from $677.6 million at the end of fiscal 2021 (excluding restricted cash, CAF debt, and financing obligations related to sale leasebacks). Cash and credit line liquidity alone is about $2.3 billion (cash alone is $314.8 million) at the end of fiscal 2023 plus billions that could be raised via real estate.",KMX,Consumer Cyclical,10692636672.0,NYQ,2293184.0,USD,63.86000061035156,True,1,74.07800005744588,73.41679024402717,1
24/11/2023,"Expanding Portfolio and Cloud Transition Drive Growth, While Switching Costs Create Narrow Moat",Atlassian Corp,TEAM,3,03/11/2023,Dan Romanoff,180.55,USD,23/11/2023,215.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,B,03/11/2023,"We are maintaining our fair value estimate of $215 per share for narrow-moat Atlassian after the company reported good results for its fiscal first quarter coupled with solid guidance for the second quarter. With shares selling off after hours we see a buying opportunity. Our model changes are minor and we struggle to uncover a supportable rationale for the selloff. Demand trends remain healthy overall and are showing signs of improvement as the company reported better-than-expected revenue and much-better-than-expected profitability. Guidance calls for solid revenue growth and good operating margins. Overall, results support our long-term thesis on a quality growth company. Total revenue for the quarter grew 21% year over year, to $978 million, compared with the high end of guidance of $970 million. Subscription revenue grew 31% year over year to $852 million, which was in line with our aggressive assumptions. Management said the company continues to gain traction in premium and enterprise accounts. Cloud migrations are on track, per management, but there is a good size pool of customers who still have not migrated, and may not migrate by the end of support deadline in February 2024. Customer additions have been volatile over the last year even as deal sizes are picking up. Atlassian added several thousand new customers in the quarter overall, and 1,377 customers in the cloud that generate $10,000 or more of annually recurring revenue, or ARR. Top of funnel demand remains positive, so overall demand is not problematic, in our opinion, even as conversions of free users remains depressed against historical norms. Profitability remains a bright spot for Atlassian, as it has for much of our coverage, which supports our long-term profitability assumptions. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23.0%, compared with 18.3% a year ago and guidance of 19.5%. Spending discipline, better revenue, and benefits from lower headcount drove margin strength.","Atlassians growth has been strong and is expected to remain so, with robust new customer adds, client retention, upselling, and the introduction of new solutions. The company is disruptive to existing markets, especially to legacy software providers. Additionally, Jira Service Desk has dramatically expanded the addressable market beyond the IT function. Because Atlassian has a limited salesforce, its sales and marketing expenses are significantly lower than peers, driving already solid non-GAAP operating margins and allowing for material expansion over the next five years.","Atlassian has traded at lofty valuations at times, and while it might continue to generate strong growth, the company may fail to live up to the optimistic assumptions that are sometimes embedded in the share price. Despite generating billions of dollars in revenue, the company is still not generating positive GAAP operating margins, and is not expected to do so within the next several years. The cloud transition aspect makes analysis of the company more challenging.
",04/08/2023,"Atlassian endeavors to unleash the potential of teams through better planning, project management, and workflow software, and we think its strong momentum is likely to continue over the next five years as the transition to the cloud continues. Atlassians original product, Jira, was designed as a workflow solution for software developers that has grown into a richly featured, easy-to-use, inexpensive, easy-to-buy application. The software is often bundled with Confluence, a collaboration tool. The firm has also gradually moved upmarket toward enterprise customers, even as it continues to serve customers of all sizes. Atlassian employs a distinct go-to-market strategy that eschews the traditional enterprise salesforce in favor of a low-cost, low-touch online marketing effort and e-commerce transactions on the firms website. Free versions further help drive a large funnel. This is done in order to simplify the purchasing and onboarding process. Because of the companys web-based sales model, its sales and marketing expenses are among the lowest among enterprise software peers, leading to solid non-GAAP margins. That said, since sales and marketing expenses are typically the largest cost for software companies, we believe margins can expand significantly as the company matures. In the meantime, management believes its best marketing is a great product that is easy to buy and use that drives viral adoption within an organization once adopted by the first team. Atlassian has excelled at upselling customers with more seats, additional products, and new use cases, and is also moving clients from on-premises to the cloud. We expect these factors to combine to drive strong top-line growth over the next five years. Retention is strong and upsell is obvious. In our view, new use cases in particular are critical in driving long-term growth, as the service desk solution is applicable throughout an enterprise, whereas the IT-centric products have a narrower market. To that end, after its 2013 introduction, Jira Service Desk is already the first Atlassian solution that nearly one fifth of customers land with, as use cases have expanded to human resources and compliance. ","We assign a narrow moat rating to Atlassian, primarily because of switching costs. Our position is that switching costs for software are driven by several factors, the most obvious of which is the direct time and expense of implementing a new software package while maintaining the existing platform. Additionally, there are indirect costs along those same lines, mainly lost productivity as customers move up a learning curve on the new system along with the distraction of users involved in the function where the change is occurring. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is the operational risk, including loss of data during the changeover, project execution, and potential operational disruption. The more critical the function and the more touch points across an organization a software vendor has, the higher the switching costs.Atlassian provides project planning and management software, collaboration tools, and IT help desk solutions. The same logic that powers the companys IT help desk service solution is helping the company branch out to other areas within the enterprise organization, notably to human resources. The companys first product, Jira Software, helps software developers plan and manage coding projects. Jira Software is frequently used in conjunction with Confluence, the companys main collaboration solution. Over the years, the companys workflow software has been adapted to teams and processes outside of software development. Atlassian recognized this and in 2013 formally launched Jira Service Desk, a workflow solution that applies a ticketing logic. The main uses for Jira Service Desk have been IT help desks, HR, and compliance, but the use cases are broader still. Once these software products are adopted, we believe they become integral to the workflow of software developers, or within the IT function, which we believe establishes switching costs as a moat source for Atlassian.The company operates in four segments: subscriptions (term licenses and cloud agreements), maintenance (annual maintenance contracts that provide support and periodic updates and are generally attached to perpetual license sales), perpetual license (up-front sale for indefinite usage of the software), and other (training, strategic consulting, and revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store). Subscriptions is the largest segment and is growing the fastest, which should be obvious since the company is in the midst of a model transition. Maintenance and perpetual license should contribute no revenue within a few years.Atlassians customer gathering effort differs from most enterprise software companies. Whereas the vast majority of enterprise software providers push larger deals through a direct salesforce in a lengthy qualification, product-proving, and relationship-building process, Atlassian sells its software over the internet without a direct salesforce. In fact, 98% of transactions occur on the companys website. This dynamic is on display in the companys income statement, which shows sales and marketing expenses are the lowest as a percentage of revenue within our coverage.Management initially wanted to remove as much friction from the sales process as possible, so it eschewed the direct salesforce model, offered its products at generally lower prices than competitors, and allowed users to be up and running within a matter of hours rather than months. Instead, it relied on search engine optimization and targeted online advertising to attract new teams to its roster, and viral spreading within an organization once Jira was adopted by the first team. This strategy has been successful and has not changed since its inception.Atlassian offers its solutions under software-as-a-service subscriptions and perpetual license agreements, with transparent pricingall available on the companys website 24/7. While some niche competitors may offer free versions of project management software, these solutions tend to be stripped down. In order to have access to all features, the customer must pay for the freemium conversion. The Jira Software SaaS version is priced at $10 per user per month for up to 10 users, while 11-100 users is $5 per monthand customers do not have to sign up for annual contracts. So for a maximum of a few hundred dollars a year, a small software development company could base its entire production process around Jira. Conversely, a small team of 20 members within a larger organization can purchase Jira quickly and without a lengthy approval processagain for just a few hundred dollars per year. This is generally in line with peers. On the Service Desk side, however, Jira shines, as this solution is inexpensive compared with other leading peers, including ServiceNow, BMC (Remedy), and HP Enterprise. The flip side of this is twofold in that we consider ServiceNow, for example, more robust, and to use Jira Service Desk, Jira Core must be installed first.Our general view is that enterprise software companies compete on features and functionality rather than price. In this case, our assessment is that Atlassian competes on both vectors, and has purposefully elected to do so. This approach to selling software made it quick, cheap, and frictionless to try or buy Jira. From the companys perspective, it believes the opportunity in front of it is enormous and freely admits to being in land-grab mode, noting that there will be time to optimize for price in the future. Along those lines, management defined the market as $35 billion in its registration statementa figure it hasnt recently updated.While Jiras low price, particularly on the Service Desk solution, is part of Atlassians strategy, its solutions arent necessarily low-end. Indeed, notable third-party software reviewers indicate that the company should be considered a strong competitor and could be considered for most agile planning use cases. Our assessment is that Service Desk is a good product and continues to garner recognition and traction. While the companys sales and marketing expense line might be on the low end compared with peers, its research and development expense, at 47% of fiscal 2018 revenue, skews toward the high end of the spectrum among peers. Further, the companys rapid growth, even from a sizable revenue base of $880 million last year suggests the software resonates with customers.Attacking the market in this manner makes sense to us. On the pricing front, the company can simultaneously offer competitive (or better) pricing and buying than legacy competitors, while offering competitive features. Pricing, however, is not necessarily easy to compare among competitors. Our analysis suggests for a typical midrange customer, Jira is cheaper than Rally (acquired by Computer Associates), but more expensive than Microsoft. On Microsoft in particular, we believe the incumbent advantage is powerful, as the company has a foot in the door at virtually every potential customer, from SMBs to the largest companies in the world, and has the ability to attach Azure DevOps to Azure deployments, or on-premises Windows Server installations. That said, Jira can be integrated pretty smoothly with Azure DevOps, so a firm could use Jira at the developer level for its tools, and Azure DevOps for overall project management. Our research indicates these two products are both well regarded and that this is a popular use case.","We assign Atlassian a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The company generally trades at high multiples relative to peers. While it is expected to produce revenue growth at the high end of peers and the premium may be justified, higher absolute valuation levels offer less room for missteps and therefore carry greater inherent risks, in our opinion.Atlassian caters to companies of all sizes, which means there is revenue concentration among the largest customers. On the flip side, smaller customers typically have higher churn. We think this could be exacerbated in Atlassians case, as nearly all sales are monthly rather than annually, although this is changing as the company moves to a cloud model.Atlassian has not reached profitability on a GAAP basis, and we are not contemplating positive GAAP operating profits in our model for several years.Atlassian faces strong competition from Microsoft on the software planning side and from ServiceNow on the help desk and general workflow side. There are also other legacy providers in both markets. We believe the legacy providers are the most at risk for market share loss. Microsoft is strong generally in the planning tools market, and has seen a further uptick as Azure has caught fire over the last couple of years. Similarly, ServiceNow has been displacing service desk software providers for years now.While the companys frictionless sales model is appealing, we think at some point the company will need a roster of sale representatives to deal with larger and more complex customer needs. With no sales presence, the company has no relationship to fall back on in the case of an unsatisfied customer.While we do not see significant environmental, social, and governance risks, we note Atlassian faces strong competition for software engineers on the hiring front and also faces risks arising from a potential data breach within its data centers. We also see the co-CEO structure as unusual but not necessarily a governance risk.","We assign Atlassian a Standard stewardship rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think investments back into the business are most likely to be the key driver of total shareholder returns and are therefore appropriately prioritized over other capital returns such as dividends and buybacks.The balance sheet is sound with a net cash position, including $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, and approximately $1 billion in debt in the form of a term loan. Gross leverage is distorted given that the company is losing money on a GAAP basis. as a result of financial pressure arising from its model transition to cloud subscriptions. We view this pressure as transitory and thus expect the balance sheet to remain sound, as the company has typically maintained a conservative approach to leverage and generates more than enough free cash flow to fund growth and execute its acquisition strategy.Atlassian does not pay a dividend, nor would we expect a company of this size or growth trajectory to do so. Further, the company has not repurchased stock, and we do not expect it to do so in the near term. Atlassian has been modestly acquisitive, with one or two tuck-in acquisitions annually. Our model contemplates $40 million-$50 million annually for technology feature-driven deals.Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes co-founded Atlassian in 2002 and have served as co-CEOs since. They created the original code development planning software and have overseen the expansion first into the IT service desk market and then into the ticketing service desk market more broadly. Growth has been rapid and overwhelmingly organic.","Atlassian produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently and effectively. The company provides project planning and management software, collaboration tools, and IT help desk solutions. The company operates in four segments: subscriptions (term licenses and cloud agreements), maintenance (annual maintenance contracts that provide support and periodic updates and are generally attached to perpetual license sales), perpetual license (upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software), and other (training, strategic consulting, and revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store). Atlassian was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Sydney.","We believe Atlassian is a financially sound company. Revenue is growing rapidly, the company has clearly moved beyond just attaining critical mass, and the balance sheet is in great shapeoffset by negative operating margins that are expected to remain so for at least a couple of years. We believe Atlassian will continue to attract new clients with its low-friction, self-service sales model, and we expect existing clients to continue adding seats and other products, as it has already proved it can do.Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins had been improving before Atlassian began its transition to a subscription model. Margin pressure is normal for several years in the context of model transition stories, and we expect fiscal 2024 to be the trough in this regard. Given the companys self-service sales model, we believe margins should ultimately be higher than average once Atlassian matures.Atlassian does not pay a dividend, does not repurchase stock, and has completed a variety of acquisitions since 2015. Deals are typically technology-driven and less than $50 million. The company also makes a variety of venture investments. While we do not expect share buybacks or a dividend anytime soon, we have included $40 million-$50 million in acquisitions annually throughout our discrete forecast. We believe the company will use M&A to add features to the platform or introduce new cross-selling solutions to the portfolio.",TEAM,Technology,50349891584.0,NMS,1105383.0,USD,180.5500030517578,True,1,190.70764698701998,217.79135810004198,1
25/11/2023,Paychex Benefits From a Resilient SMB Market and Sticky Clients Despite Macro Headwinds ,Paychex Inc,PAYX,3,27/09/2023,Emma Williams,118.5,USD,24/11/2023,120.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,27/09/2023,"Wide-moat Paychex reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with top-line growth exceeding our expectations and profitability broadly in line. Following the result, we have marginally lifted our full-year forecasts to the upper end of guidance, but our longer-term forecasts and $120 fair value estimate are unchanged. Paychexs longstanding and well-respected CFO, Efrain Rivera, will retire in October 2023 and be succeeded by Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations Bob Schrader. We expect no material shift to the firms strategy or capital allocation on the back of this leadership change. At current prices, Paychex shares screen as fairly valued relative to our valuation. Revenue in the first quarter increased a healthy 7% year over year, underpinned by new client wins and worksite employee growth, and higher revenue per client on like-for-like price increases and greater product attach. Paychex continues to enjoy regulatory tailwinds driving demand for retirement solutions and ongoing uptake of employee retention tax credit services. The firm is also reaping benefits from investment in expanding and promoting its insurance product suite, and a resilient SMB market with modest hiring activity and healthy client retention. Paychex achieved improved profitability year over year during the quarter on greater contribution from ultra-high-margin interest income and improved operating leverage on a larger client base. This supported a 60-basis-point operating margin expansion to an impressive 41.7%, partly offset by higher employee compensation and continued investment in product innovation and marketing.","Paychex is well placed to benefit from increased regulatory complexity under a U.S. Democratic administration. Paychex benefits from high customer switching costs, a scale-based cost advantage, and strong brand assets and a referral network built over many decades. Paychex dominates the small-business outsourced payroll market with strong prospects of further market penetration.","Paychex faces increasing competitive pressure from nimble upstarts, legacy peers, and accounting software providers encroaching on the full-service market. This dynamic will likely lead to greater pricing pressure for Paychex and continued elevated investment in software development. Payroll and HCM software is becoming increasingly commoditized, and newer operators will look to gradually develop their own record of performance. Paychex is highly exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets. ",27/09/2023,"Paychex's offering appeals to businesses wishing to outsource mission-critical functions, manage and attract employees, and remain compliant with increasingly complex and evolving regulations. We expect increased regulatory complexity, tight labor markets, and a growing adoption of hybrid work will underpin strong demand for Paychex's suite of offerings supporting greater share of wallet and market share gains. This includes greater penetration of the outsourced payroll and human resources model in the small-business market. While we factor in market share gains, we expect increasing competition to limit Paychex's pricing power and force the company to maintain elevated expenditure on software development and innovation to remain competitive.  Paychex's solutions span from do-it-yourself payroll with add-on human capital management modules to full-service HR outsourcing via an administrative services organization or professional employer organization model. The ASO and PEO solutions allow a business to outsource critical HR functions to Paychex, including payroll, compliance, and benefits administration, and access support from onsite HR professionals. The main difference between the two models is that under a PEO, Paychex enters a co-employment arrangement and acts as the employer of record for tax and insurance purposes. Clients can benefit from Paychex's scale to secure competitively priced benefits, allowing them to attract and retain talent and minimize expenses. Paychex also operates an insurance agency business and offers stand-alone solutions such as retirement services administration. Paychex differentiates itself from software-only solutions through its 24/7 customer service support, allowing clients to source advice on HR and compliance matters.  We expect Paychex to continue to diversify its revenue streams away from payroll through increased focus on HR solutions, including outsourcing and insurance. By fiscal 2033, we expect payroll revenue will contribute about 36% of total revenue from an estimated 41% in 2023. The remainder of revenue will be evenly split among the PEO and insurance business and HCM solutions, including through the ASO. ","Paychex has a wide economic moat underpinned by high customer switching costs. It also benefits from intangible assets, including its brand strength accumulated over several decades, an extensive referral network, and cost advantages due to economies of scale. Despite facing intense competitive pressure from legacy peers, nimble cloud native upstarts, and accounting software providers, Paychex has improved retention and achieved steady underlying operating margin expansion over the past decade. While we expect returns on invested capital to continue to come under pressure due to consistent investment in software development and pricing pressure, we are comfortable that Paychex will be able to earn maintainable economic profits for at least the next 20 years. Paychex dominates the small-business outsourced payroll processing market, servicing over 740,000 clients primarily in the United States. We estimate 95% of these clients are in the highly fragmented 1- to 49-employee small-business market, representing an estimated 11% market share. Approximately 65% of this market is serviced by regional providers or do-it-yourself software-only solutions such as Intuit's QuickBooks or Microsoft Excel, creating meaningful scope for greater penetration of Paychex's value-added offering. As of fiscal 2021, Paychex's average clients number of employees was in the midteens and we estimate at least 80% of clients employ fewer than 20 people. Paychex also services the lower end of the midmarket categorized by 50-999 employees, with an estimated 15% market share in fiscal 2023. As with payroll and HCM peers, Paychex benefits from high customer switching costs. Payroll and HCM software is typically deeply embedded in a business' operations, making it a costly and time-intensive process to switch providers. Alongside monetary costs, a business could face operational disruptions and inefficiencies, including having to train employees on the new system and integrate the new solution with other software and risk losing data as a result. These switching costs are magnified for customers that outsource HR functions to Paychex through the admin-only (ASO) or co-employment models (PEO). These models that allow a customer to outsource mission-critical HR operations such as recruitment, compliance, and benefits administration are deeply entrenched in a business' day-to-day operations. Despite facing intense competitive pressure, Paychex has modestly improved client retention to 84% on average over the five years to 2023, relative to 83% over the 10 years to 2023. Considering that approximately 8.5% of annual client losses are attributed to business failures, we view this retention as reflective of high switching costs. Further, Paychex's retention surpasses the retention of competitors in the small-business market, including Intuit's QuickBooks and Xero, of around 80%. Over the long run, we expect Paychex will continue to invest in software development, customer service, and user experience to maintain customer satisfaction and high retention rates. Maintaining high customer retention allows Paychex to earn a steady stream of recurring revenue at low marginal cost. Paychex has expanded its offering over the past decade to include a broad range of HCM solutions, including HR outsourcing, benefits, and insurance services, in addition to traditional payroll. Paychex offers bundled and unbundled solutions as well as integration capabilities to complementary small-business software, including accounting software and point-of-sale technology, as well as job listing website Indeed. Customers can upgrade their Paychex software to include modules such as benefits administration and time and attendance, increasing the stickiness of the business. Small-business customers tend to prefer all-in-one bundled solutions rather than integrating several providers, making them prime targets for Paychex to upsell modules to. Over the five years to fiscal 2021, demand for retirement services plans and health and benefits insurance outpaced total client growth. Paychex has built a strong reputation over many decades for delivering reliable and compliant solutions for hundreds of thousands of small-business clients, allowing it to win market share and charge premium pricing. Payroll is a highly sensitive and mission-critical operation for all businesses that place a high value on reliability, accuracy, compliance, and data security. The potential ramifications of failing to make payroll on time or accurately, being noncompliant with applicable laws, or breaching data security can be severe. We expect Paychex has a reputation advantage over smaller, younger operators that lack a record of performance and can attract new business over these operators. Further, Paychex has fostered a powerful distribution relationship with accounting bodies in the United States, banks, and existing clients, with over half of new small-business payroll customers coming through a referral. Despite fierce competition from younger, nimble providers such as Gusto and Paylocity, as well as ADP increasing its presence in the small-business market in recent years, Paychex has been able to win market share, which we attribute to the strength of its intangible assets. Paychex has traditionally charged premium pricing; however, this has diminished somewhat in recent years due to increasing competitive pressures. Paychex benefits from a cost advantage stemming from economies of scale, creating an advantage over small operators. Paychex is the leading provider of outsourced payroll and HCM solutions to the small-business market in the U.S., paying 1 in 12 private-sector workers. This scale allows Paychex to spread its fixed capital investment, namely software development, and marketing spending over a larger base, affording the company a lower marginal cost relative to smaller operators. For instance, younger operator Paylocity, with a client base 4% the size of Paychexs, was paying about 45% of revenue on selling, general, and administrative expense over the five years to fiscal 2021, compared with 32% for Paychex. The incremental cost of adding a new customer to the platform is minimal and creates material operating leverage for Paychex. Increasingly, small-business clients are using self-service technology to demo, purchase, and onboard themselves to the platform without engaging sales or customer-service teams, further reducing the cost to serve for Paychex. We expect its superior cost position will provide adequate headway for Paychex to combat pricing pressure from competitors and upsell additional modules to existing clients at a lower cost, increasing the stickiness of the business.","Paychex has diversified its revenue away from a reliance on payroll, but it remains highly exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets, underpinning our high uncertainty rating. This exposure is magnified by Paychex's reliance on small-business clients, which are more likely to fail during an economic downturn. As an example, Paychex's client base shrank 6% between 2008 and 2010 before staging a gradual recovery to pre-Great Recession levels by 2014. Since the Great Recession, Paychex has increased its exposure to larger clients but remains at the mercy of economic conditions. This also includes upside uncertainty, as we expect Paychex would benefit from new business formation, tighter labor markets, and higher yields on client funds during an economic boom. The company benefited from government stimulus in the COVID-19 recession, which propped up small businesses and created greater regulatory complexity and demand for Paychex's administration and compliance services. Paychex's environmental, social, and governance risk is low. Paychex handles high volumes of sensitive, personally identifiable information for its customers and their employees, exposing the company to data privacy and security risk; however, we view this risk as immaterial to our uncertainty rating. If a data security breach or breaching of data privacy laws were to occur, Paychex would be exposed to regulatory fines, civil lawsuits, or reputational damage. However, Paychex has reasonable measures in place to mitigate this risk, including industry-standard data-protection technologies, regular employee training, a data security team, and executive-level responsibility for information security. Paychex is bound by regional data regulations, and it has had no material data privacy or security breaches.","We assign Paychex an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet risk, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Paychex's balance sheet health is sound. Paychex operates a capital-light business model with strong free cash flow generation and typically boasts a net cash position. The company is actively exploring bolt-on acquisitions to expand its suite of human capital management solutions and increase scale in the PEO business. We expect Paychex could comfortably increase gearing to support these acquisitions, as well as continued investment in internally generated software. Given the uncertainty around timing and pricing, we do not explicitly forecast acquisitions. In the absence of attractive acquisition targets or internal investment opportunities, we would expect Paychex to return excess cash to shareholders through increasing the payout ratio beyond 80% of net income or increasing share repurchases. We assess Paychex's investment efficacy as exceptional. Paychex has acquired several PEO businesses in recent years to expand scale and enter new markets, with the largest being the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Oasis for $1.2 billion. This acquisition propelled Paychex to become the second-largest PEO provider in the U.S. after ADP. While Paychex faced initial integration challenges related to consolidating sales processes and underwriting practices, we expect it will be able to achieve scale benefits from technology investments and synergy benefits from cross-selling in coming years. Through internal and acquisitive investment, we expect Paychex to continue to expand its suite of HCM software to remain competitive and take greater share of clients' wallets, increasing switching costs. Paychex's shareholder distributions are appropriate. The company has returned over $8 billion to shareholders over the eight years to fiscal 2023 primarily through dividends and to a lesser extent share repurchases. Paychex undertakes regular share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact from its equity compensation plan. While these repurchases have typically been executed at share prices above our fair value estimate, the quantum of the premium paid is immaterial. We expect Paychex can comfortably continue to pay out 80% of net income over our forecast period, which is in line with the company's target.","Paychex is a leading provider of payroll, human capital management, and insurance solutions servicing small and midsize clients primarily in the United States. The company, established in 1979, services over 740,000 clients and pays over 1 in 12 U.S. private-sector workers. Alongside its traditional payroll services, Paychex offers HCM solutions such as benefits administration and time and attendance software, as well as human resources outsourcing and insurance agency services.","Paychex is in a strong financial position. At the end of fiscal 2023, Paychex had a net cash position of about $800 million, including restricted cash and total corporate investments. In fiscal 2019, the company issued $800 million of fixed-rate long-term debt to fund the $1.2 billion acquisition of PEO business Oasis. We expect Paychex's annual operating income to comfortably cover interest expense on this debt at least 50 times over our forecast period. Paychex has returned over $8 billion of capital to shareholders during the nine years to fiscal 2023 primarily through dividends and to a lesser extent share repurchases. We expect Paychex's strong free cash flow generation will support an 80% dividend payout ratio over our forecast period. The balance sheet is robust, and Paychex has ample cash and scope to increase leverage to execute bolt-on acquisition plans.",PAYX,Industrials,44763869184.0,NMS,1625865.0,USD,118.5,True,0,118.32870618034825,121.94719491353415,1
25/11/2023,Intuits Switching Costs Are Doing Anything but Taxing Its Wide Moat,Intuit Inc,INTU,3,28/09/2023,Julie Sharma,564.07,USD,24/11/2023,500.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,A,28/09/2023,"Intuit hosted its investor day today, stressing five big bets that are informing the firms long-term strategic moves. Of the big bets, we think Intuits wagers on being the center of small-business growth and disrupting the small-business midmarket are the most compelling and promising to fuel growth ahead. Additionally, we continue to be impressed by Intuits ability to innovate internally as well as make smart acquisitions, which we believe are further strengthening Intuits already wide moat. Milestones highlighted through the days events (like customer retention uplift for customers using newer offerings like QuickBooks Live) keep us reassured in what we believe to be a rosy trajectory for Intuit. Intuit marked its total addressable market at $312 billion, which implies 5% penetration thus far and, unsurprisingly, Intuit reiterated fiscal 2024 guidance given last month with fourth-quarter results, leaving our financial model unchanged. As a result, we are maintaining our $500 fair value estimate, which leaves Intuit shares fairly valued. We see an overall trend of newer offerings uplifting retention, which is crucial to Intuits business, given the lower retention rates typically inherent in Intuit target markets. For example, Intuit noted a 9-point uplift in 90-day retention for QuickBooks Live customers as this capabilitys human-assisted approach moderates churn out of lack of handholding. Intuits big bet to expand its small business ecosystem well beyond QuickBooks is promising in our view, as we think which accounting software to use is typically one of the initial software decisions a small business makes, making it a great entry point to additional offerings. We think Intuits sizable bills recorded in QuickBooks ($947 billion worth in fiscal 2023) indicate a hearty segue into digitizing bill pay and automating accounts payable. Intuit sizes its payments, invoicing, banking, and capital opportunity at $82 billion.",Intuits tax revenue should climb at a healthy rate as the companys solutions intersect with the assisted tax-filing base. QuickBooks should continue to see revenue growth from Intuits growing ecosystem capabilities. Operating expenses should decrease as a percentage of revenue as the company realizes synergies between links among once disparate offerings and benefits from scale.,"Some countries outside of the U.S. automatically generate citizens tax files. If the U.S. adopted a similar program, Intuits TurboTax business could face material headwinds. Intuit could receive pressure from the IRS to include once premium features in its free tax-filing software, weakening premium software sales. Intuits switching costs could erode as software providers also catering to small businesses enter the accounting space--offering compelling reasons for QuickBooks customers to change vendors.",25/08/2023,"Intuit is the giant behind U.S. small-business accounting software QuickBooks and do-it-yourself U.S. tax software TurboTax. With TurboTax and QuickBooks online sales having eclipsed their respective desktop sales, Intuit has now transitioned into a cloud-first company. Consequently, this has enabled Intuit to leverage customer data to streamline the user experience across disparate products and to natively market its offerings, in turn supporting switching costs and a network effect, which we consider to already be the backbones of Intuits wide moat. Over the past several years, Intuit has continued to innovate, in our view. It has realized the insecurity customers have in accomplishing the consequential tasks of tax filing or business accounting on software alone. In turn, for both its small-business and consumer customers, Intuit has launched matchmaking systems. In accounting, that means matching small businesses with accountants, and in tax, that means adding a human review to the filing process. We think both matchmaking mechanisms pose meaningful opportunity ahead, in the form of increased customer retention on both sides and getting exposure to the assisted tax market. Now that Intuit is starting to reap the benefits of playing matchmaker, next up is to take big bets on QuickBooks complements, such as creating an omnichannel sales platform for small businesses. While these buildouts will take time, we think such direction will help propel the QuickBooks network effect as customers continue to demand all-in-one software to run their businesses. Intuits business is not immune to risk, which we think lies particularly in IRS tax-filing regulation as well as the risk of new entrants in the small-business accounting space. Still, such risks, in our view, would only gradually chip away at Intuits accounting and tax dominance, given the force of its network effect and its financial health equipping Intuit with the ability to turn the tides. ","We assign Intuit a wide moat rating derived from the significant switching costs and network effects in both its small business and self-employed segment and consumer segment. Intuit derives just over half of its revenue from its small business and self-employed segment, which offers QuickBooks bookkeeping software for small-business and self-employed customers, as well as their accountants. QuickBooks online has 4.5 million users, and, according to several sources, is estimated to have approximately 80% of the U.S. market share for small businesses using financial software. We think that QuickBooks exhibits high switching costs given the regularity in bookkeeping and the pain of transferring a business accounting record as well as learning a new software to record entries. Switching bookkeeping software would also require relinking new bookkeeping software with various third-party apps--such as those for connecting point-of-sale software with bookkeeping software, or those that integrate payroll data. QuickBooks has noted that its software links to up to 700 applications. We think QuickBooks retention rate of 79% is indicative of the hassle QuickBooks clients deem will ensue if they switched. While retention is low compared with enterprise software solutions as a whole, we think its retention is healthy for QuickBooks small-business customer base, which has significant churn simply due to lack of small-business survivorship. In other words, QuickBooks customers dont typically switch to an alternative software vendor, but instead shut down their businesses altogether. QuickBooks retention isnt unusual compared with other small-business software providers metrics, like Shopifys estimated retention of 75% or Xeros retention rate of over 80%.We think that QuickBooks merits a network effect because despite using an accounting software, many small businesses opt to hire an accountant to go over their books that they track through software like QuickBooks. Since QuickBooks has the majority of the U.S. market for small-business accounting software, we think accountants have very little incentive to buy accounting software compatible with the minority of U.S. small businesses, which we believe makes small-business accountants more likely to opt for QuickBooks. QuickBooks also has partnerships with U.S. universities in which about 50,000 students receive the software for free each year--perpetuating, in our view, a cycle in which QuickBooks is the most well-known small-business accounting software, giving users more benefits from using the software as QuickBooks user base increases. These benefits are derived for both the accountant and the small-business owner. For example, accountants will have a higher probability that their clients use the same software they do. By both having the same software, the accountant can see the clients books live rather than manually importing customer data into his or her software. We think these synergies are what lead Intuit partners, like PricewaterhouseCoopers, to do bulk QuickBooks orders in the thousands of units in order to sell the software to their small-business customers. Another reason users might hesitate to switch from QuickBooks is the need to retrain on other platforms for services already offered on QuickBooks, such as invoicing, payroll, assisted tax services, procurement services, and capital. We think that these options strengthen switching costs.Accounting for roughly 41% of revenue is Intuits consumer offerings, including TurboTax software for DIY tax filing and Mint, a free platform in which consumers can connect their checking, savings, and mortgage accounts to get a holistic view of their financial health. We think that TurboTax exhibits high switching costs due to the stress of learning a new tax filing interface during an often short amount of time for many tax filers. According to the IRS, 20%-25% of Americans put off filing their taxes until the last two weeks before April 15. Apart from tax-season stress, TurboTax Online users can access former tax returns, which will autofill current tax forms with basic information from the previous year, which we think supports high switching costs and which we believe is reflected in the softwares 79% retention rate. Competitors like H&R Block, on the other hand, have retention rates near 73%.We think that Mint has lower switching costs than TurboTax, given that it pertains to something less imperative than taxes, which is checking up on ones financial health. Mint is offered for free, as Intuit makes money by allowing users to share data with lenders, which gives them access to possibly lower interest rates. This extra benefit to Mint users is discrete, in our opinion--meaning a user would not lose a loan after it is secured merely because of leaving Mint. While Mint, in our view, doesnt have strong switching costs, we think that it directly contributes to upholding TurboTaxs switching costs. Tax documents from financial institutions customers have linked their Mint accounts to will automatically feed into TurboTax if cleared by the customer, making TurboTax renewals more likely, in our view.","We think Intuits business operates under medium uncertainty, given the risk of intensified regulation on online tax-filing software, yet we do not foresee any material ESG (environmental, social, or governance) issues on the horizon. Many developed countries have systems in which taxes are automatically filed for citizens, which are then reviewed by the citizens themselves, and the IRS could develop its own e-filing software. However, this was close to being restricted in April 2019 with the proposal of the Taxpayer First Act. If passed, the IRS would have been barred from ever producing free tax-filing software--a feature of many developed countries.Intuit is also under threat of losing customers to software partners in the IRS Free File program, a 2002 agreement with the IRS, to provide basic filing software for free to those with annual income of $66,000 or less--which is approximately 70% of the U.S. taxpaying population. Despite the free filing option, up until fiscal 2021, only about 3% of taxpayers use Intuits or H&R Blocks free filing options--signaling that theres room to grow with pressure to add on features to the free filing offerings. We think Intuits greatest risk associated with QuickBooks is the possibility of a current small-business software provider like Stripe or Shopify entering the accounting space, which could create compelling reasons to switch from QuickBooks. For example, having a business payments, selling, and accounting platform in one place brings a more seamless user experience.","We consider Intuits capital allocation to be Exemplary, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and mixed shareholder distributions. We think Intuits internal investment strategy will lead to excellent shareholder returns in the future under CEO Sasan Goodarzis lead. In January 2019, Goodarzi took the helm as CEO, adding to his 14-year tenure at Intuit, which included former leadership within the small-business and self-employed group. We think Goodarzi has advocated for capital allocation that has been consistent with the companys record. In our view, this entails continuing to innovate to defend its moat, closing on value-creative acquisitions when fit, and increasing shareholder returns via continuation of the companys dividend and repurchase policy. These characteristics have led us to rate Intuits investments as exemplary. We think Intuit finds a nice balance in its shareholder returns. Over the past four years, Intuit has delivered roughly $2.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Over fiscal 2018 to 2022, the companys payout ratio has fluctuated from 31% to 37%. We think Intuits balance sheet is sound, based on its low debt and healthy cash cushion, which give Intuit the resources to continue its exemplary investment strategy.","Intuit is a provider of small-business accounting software (QuickBooks), personal tax solutions (TurboTax), and professional tax offerings (Lacerte). Founded in the mid-1980s, Intuit controls the majority of U.S. market share for small-business accounting and DIY tax-filing software.","We think that Intuit is in good financial health considering its cash cushion of $2.8 billion as of July 2023. This leaves Intuit able to meet the future capital expenditures, acquisitions, repurchases, and dividends needed to uphold the business and keep shareholders happy, in our view.

24/11/2023,"Post-Acquisition of Fox Pest Control, Rollins Seems Well-Poised",Rollins Inc,ROL,2,26/10/2023,Grant Slade,40.02,USD,23/11/2023,32.5,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,26/10/2023,"Rollins strong third-quarter performance provided investors with a level of comfort that North American pest-control market conditions havent deteriorated sharply in recent months. The company delivered elevated organic growth of 8.4% year on yearlargely according with our full-year 2023 organic growth expectationsoutperforming the weak third-quarter North American result for wide-moat peer Rentokil Initial. Price increases more than offset inflationary pressures and worked in combination with operating leverage to continue widening Rollins operating margin, which rose 240 basis points to 22.3% in the third quarter and thus was tracking modestly ahead of our prior expectation for 2023 EBIT margin progression. We have lifted our 2023 EBIT forecast to $617 million and our EPS estimate to $0.93, representing respective increases of 3.5% and 4.5%. In turn, the combination of the modest upgrade to our near-term operating margin assumption and a time value of money adjustment leads us to lift our fair value estimate by 5% to $32.50 per share. Rollins robust organic growth relieved investors; the stock was up 8% at the time of writing after having fallen sharply in response to the recent trading update from Rentokil. Still, with Rollins' stock down some 22% since late July, we think investors expectations for the wide-moat company look far more reasonable than they have for quite some time. Indeed, we think Rentokils recent soft trading updatefor greater detail, see our Oct. 19 note Rentokil Initial: Shares Appealing as Weak Pest Control Sales Offer an Attractive Entry Pointhas acted as a reminder to investors that organic growth delivered by Rollins since the coronavirus pandemic is elevated and has outpaced historical norms by a substantial margin.","The recent uptick in capital allocated to tuck-in acquisitions is likely to continue, supporting economies of scale and boosting operating margin.  Phase 2 of the route optimization technology rollout looks to further widen Rollins EBIT margin.  Increasing per-capita spending on pest control should support Rollins organic growth at a mid-single-digit clip. ","Competition is heating up for pest control M&A, putting upward pressure on deal multiples.  A somewhat more passive approach to M&A may see Rollins outbid on value-accretive acquisitions.  The ultimate rollout of phase 3 and 4 of Rollins route optimization technology may be less margin-accretive than earlier iterations. ",27/04/2023,"Rollins strategy is to reinforce the density benefits afforded to its market-leading operations in the highly localized pest-control services markets it competes in across North America. Ever-improving unit costs are offered by economies of density in each regional market in which Rollins operates. Rollins seeks to continue to amass these benefits via organic growth and a continued focus on tuck-in acquisitions aimed at rolling up the fragmented North American pest-control services market.  A persistent focus on improving technician productivity and reducing operating costs reinforces the superior cost curve position of the Rollins franchise. Recent investments in route optimization technology exemplify Rollins cost-out strategy, the continued rollout of which is likely to widen EBIT margins. A durable cost advantage has accrued to Rollins as result of execution of the business strategy, leading to our wide-moat designation. Pest-control acquisitions and continuing focus on cost-out initiatives are key to the strategy. Nonetheless, Rollins remains equally focused on the defense of its leading North American market positions, noting that the loss of customers quickly unwinds the operating-margin-widening benefits of density. This defense comes in the form of a relentless focus on customer service excellence, which Rollins views as key to its high customer retention rates. With the business significant skew toward the residential pest-control segment of the market. where industry barriers to entry are lowest, this forms an important component of Rollins strategy. Rollins requires annual training of all of pest-control technicians and limits its organic market share gains to maintain strong service levels and customer satisfaction. Rollins asserts that persistent organic top-line growth above midsingle digits may negatively affect customer retention rates as the group could struggle to balance growth with service quality. ","We credit Rollins with a wide economic moat rating, reflecting the superior cost position of the North American industry-leading pest-control franchise. Rollins purchased the Orkin pest-control business in the mid-1960s. By the early 1990s, Rollins had fully divested its range of non-pest-control business interests to focus on the pest-control industry. Today, Rollins is North Americas largest pest-control business with operations spanning 47 U.S. states and Canada. Organic growth and spirited merger and acquisition activitywhich commenced in the 1990s and remains a key component of Rollins strategy todayhave delivered market-leading positions across the highly localized pest-control markets in which Rollins competes. Leading share in localized pest-control markets translates into cost advantages, which accrue to a route-based business like pest control as density of service provision increases.The professional pest-control industry provides services to suppress pest prevalence and maintain the hygiene of the physical locations of commercial, public-sector, and residential customers. Interventions carried out by the industry contain pests that could otherwise damage commercial interests or endanger public health, including rodents, cockroaches, bedbugs, ants, wasps, termites, birds, snakes, and fleas. Provision of services to the residential segment of the North American pest-control market, inclusive of termite prevention, accounts for approximately 65% of revenue with the remainder attributed to commercial customers. This contrasts with a number of Rollins major European pest-control peers, which tend to focus heavily on the commercial segment of global pest-control markets. The divergence in sales mix relative to peers is partly explained by the geographic focus of Rollins on the U.S., which features a significantly larger residential market for pest-control services owing to climate and its termite-prone timber-frame housing stock. Rollins does not compete in niche segments of the pest-control market, which include agricultural, marine and large-scale vector control.Economies of scale prevail typically in business operations, which are characterized by high fixed costs. Fixed costs emanate from an inability to scale certain production costs below some minimum level when demand is low. As a result, certain categories of production costs arent fully variable, meaning a business must bear its fixed costs in full regardless of whether demand is high or low. Pest control is a prime example of an inability to scale production costs to precisely align with prevailing market demand. Analyzing Rollins cost structure is challenging, owing to the fact Rollins does not disclose the individual line items that make up cost of services provided or selling, general, and administrative costs. Nonetheless, inspection of the cost structure of its major pest-control peersincluding Rentokil Initial and Anticimexis instructive. Fixed and step-fixed (part fixed and part variable) costs dominate the cash operating costs of pest-control businesses. In the case of Rentokil Initial, an approximate 75% of cash operating costs are considered fixed or step-fixed in nature. Fixed and step-fixed costs account for an approximate 66% of Anticimexs cash operating costs. Most significant among these largely invisible production cost categories is labor, which constituted an average of 60% of total cash operating costs over 2016-20 for Rentokil Initial and Anticimex. Further sources of cost indivisibility stem from pest-control service vehicle fleet costs, property expenses, and other fixed costs. Therefore, players that boast superior localized scale, such as Rollins, benefit from a durable cost advantage as fixed and step-fixed costs are better fractionalized across a larger revenue base relative to players with inferior local market share.The economics of route-based businesses such as pest control are overwhelmingly localized. Increased local market share (scale) translates into better unit costs and therefore a widened operating margin. As market share increases, the use of routing optimization tools, density planning, and smart scheduling for Rollins pest-control technicians unlocks the density benefits from the ongoing consolidation of localized pest control. Rollins global industry-leading cost position is evidenced in its operating margins. Superior density in the North American markets where Rollins competes has yielded higher average EBIT margins over the preceding five years relative to other large-scale internationally active players. These key internationally active competitors, which include Rentokil Initial, Terminix, Anticimex, and Ecolab, are also actively engaged in the ongoing roll-up of the global industry. With Rollins enjoying better margins than its largest competitorswhich also benefit from EBIT margin-widening scale economieswe infer that the cost advantage that Rollins maintains over the highly fragmented tail end of the market is meaningful. ","We assign Rollins a Medium Uncertainty Rating. Demand for pest control benefits from the essential role the services play in protecting the public from health and safety risks. As a result, the groups pest-control revenue is largely insensitive to the vagaries of the business cycle. The highly contracted nature of revenueapproximately 80% of Rollins revenue is contractedprovides a further level of earnings protection. However, the extent of operating leverage in the cost structure does leave the group exposed to customer losses, which mitigates some of the virtues of scale economies enjoyed by Rollins.We deem environmental, social, and governance risks associated with Rollins as low. The pest-control business implements a range of chemical-based pest interventions. Some of these chemicalswhich include pesticides and rodenticidescan, if implemented incorrectly, be dangerous should they come into contact with customers, Rollins personnel, or the surrounding environment. Nonetheless, we see the risk associated with the use of pesticides as well managed by robust technician training and operational procedures. Separately, as a route-based service provider, Rollins operates a substantial fleet of service vehicles. It is transitioning to a lower-emission service vehicle fleet with increasing use of hybrid and electric vehicles. ","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Rollins. Were in favor of Rollins' ongoing participation in the roll-up of the global pest-control industry. Tuck-in acquisitions remain a key part of Rollins strategy. Nonetheless, while we appreciate the highly selective approach to its acquisitions, we think Rollins could create greater value for shareholders by hastening the pace at which it is allocating capital toward tuck-in acquisition targets. Major pest-control peers also active in North America, including Rentokil Initial and Terminix, have outspent Rollins in recent years. Consideration of a wider range of potential acquisition targets, including establishing a meaningful presence in fast-growing Asian pest-control markets, could assist Rollins in deploying more capital toward shareholder value-accretive M&A targets.Rollins prudent approach to its balance sheet is sound and presents very little risk to shareholder value. In fact, we think the companys highly conservative approach to debt could be somewhat relaxed without risking the balance sheet, particularly given that revenue is largely immune to the ebbs and flow of the business cycle, owing to the ""necessitylike"" demand characteristics of pest control.We deem Rollins shareholder distribution policies as appropriate. The business is highly cash-generative, owing largely to the capital-light nature of the pest-control industry. While acquisitions are Rollins largest use of cash, free cash flow is also returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. A special dividendtypically declared at the end of the third quarter of the fiscal yearprovides Rollins with the flexibility to return capital to shareholders that is surplus to near-term M&A requirements. Historically, surplus capital has also been returned to shareholders via on-market share buybacks, albeit on a far less frequent basis than via the payment of special dividends. ","Rollins is a global leader in route-based pest-control services, with operations spanning North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Australia. Its portfolio of pest-control brands includes the prominent Orkin brand, market leader in the U.S., where it boasts near national coverage, and in Canada. Residential pest and termite prevention dominates the services provided by Rollins, owing to the groups ongoing focus on U.S. and Canadian markets. ","Rollins typically conservative balance sheet is in good health, with a net cash position of $50 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 despite the modest use of debt to fund the April 2023 Fox Pest Control acquisition. Rollins takes a highly prudent approach to the use of debt, typically using it only to act opportunistically when a quality acquisition target is in play and using subsequent operating cash flow to promptly retire debt. In line with this approach, we expect Rollins to use free cash flow to promptly retire debt used to finance the Fox Pest Control acquisition.We think Rollins has the capacity to incorporate more debt in its target capital structure, particularly given the demand profile for pest-control services, which tends to be very insensitive to the vagaries of the business cycle. As such, Rollins retains substantial balance sheet flexibility to capitalize on larger acquisitions if such opportunities arise. Returning surplus capital to shareholders could also be considered.Rollins maintains $425 million in debt facilities, which provide an additional source of liquidity. The facilities carry a leverage covenant of 3.0 times net debt/EBITDA and mature in April 2024.",ROL,Consumer Cyclical,19801995264.0,NYQ,1409937.0,USD,40.02000045776367,True,0,38.181411563654116,43.28765459414074,1
24/11/2023,Denso Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Secular Automobile Electrification Trend,Denso Corp,6902,3,07/11/2023,Jason Kondo,2425.5,JPY,24/11/2023,2375.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,07/11/2023,"We leave our fair value estimate for Denso unchanged at JPY 2,375 with September-quarter operating margin disappointingly lower and dampening better-than-expected revenue growth. While we tweak our fiscal 2023 (ending March 2024) assumptions, our medium-term outlook remains intact. We believe Densos shares are fairly valued. Our fair value estimate prices Denso at 15.9 times fiscal 2023 price/earnings. We forecast five-year EPS to average 16.9% growth. The September-quarter operating margin of 6.5% fell short of our estimate by 3.3 percentage points, due to quality-related provisions and slow progress in cost pass-throughs. The company continues to guide operating margin for the full year to be 9.0%, which we think will be challenging to meet as we think capacity utilization is unlikely to rise while a complete cost pass-through may still lag and high labor costs at its U.S. operations remain. We now expect fiscal 2023 operating margin of 8.3% versus 8.6% previously. Nonetheless, we continue to project operating margin to increase to 9.8% by 2025, driven by further sales of its high-margin electrification/heat pump products for electric vehicles as well as the restructuring of its North America business, which includes the production transfer of its lower-margin thermal products to Mexico. We expect the shift to help lower operating costs over the next three years. September-quarter revenue was stronger than expected, growing 12% year on year, mainly due to the domestic production volume recovery of its largest customer, Toyota, which grew 24% in the same period. We raise our revenue growth projection by 1.5 percentage points to 9.8% year on year, but our top-line projection in the second half remains largely unchanged.","Increased sales of newer value-added components, like ECUs and heat pump systems, will contribute to margin expansion going forward.
 High R&D spending, a strong relationship with one of the leading OEMs, Toyota Motor, and switching costs support Densos economic moat.
 Restructuring initiatives in North America and Europe will contribute to margin expansion.","Having a majority of sales from Toyota Group companies can give pricing leverage to the OEM customers, which poses a risk to Densos profitability.
 Increasing competition in the automotive components space due to new market entrants, such as from IT and electronic components industries, makes it increasingly to difficult obtain market share with newer products.
 Further restructuring of the product portfolio is required, as commoditized, low-value-added products like ICE automobile components will slow margin expansion.",07/11/2023,"As one of the largest global automotive component suppliers, Denso has a diverse portfolio of products, ranging from traditional powertrain/thermal components for internal combustion engine vehicles to relatively newer technologies such as electrification/mobility-related components. To adapt to a once in a hundred years transformation in the automotive industry, the company has been spending high amounts on research and development in recent years. In Japan, Denso has been engaging in various projects with its main original equipment manufacturer customer, Toyota Motor, as well as other components supplier companies in the Toyota Group, to jointly develop various technologies (including semiconductors, electrification, and advanced driver-assistance systems). We expect these initiatives will prevent commoditization of its key technologies, thus allowing the company to maintain its narrow moat. While the shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles will present a risk for many components manufacturers, as the number of parts in a single automobile will decline, we believe Densos diverse product range will allow the company to mitigate the risk relative to some of the other suppliers in Japan. The company has a record of supplying parts for leading hybrid vehicles, like the Toyota Prius, where it will be able to utilize its technology for battery-powered EVs as well as fuel cell vehicles. The company commands strong market share in inverters (35%), motor generators (16%), and battery engine control units (36%), which serve as key components for electric vehicles. Further, the company boasts a 60% domestic share and 40% global share with its thermal management products, which we expect will be another field where Denso can be competitive amid the electrification trend as it looks to develop a new heat pump cycle that does not require the heat source from an engine.","We assign Denso a narrow moat rating. As one of the top three diversified automotive components company by sales (competing with Robert Bosch and narrow-moat Continental), the companys long-term track record with major automobile original equipment manufacturers as well as switching costs will continue to support its moat, in our view. High Switching Costs Involved in Key Component SuppliersWe think switching costs are a key moat source for Denso, since the costs involved in changing suppliers make it a rare case for an automotive components supplier to be replaced by its OEM customers during the contracted period of a model. Switching costs apply once an OEM starts the development of a new automobile model, which generally takes 18-36 months for the model development phase and about 5-10 years for production. When working with their component vendors, OEMs generally share costs, such as tooling, labor costs, and system validation, with their suppliers (like Denso) in order to customize specifications of the model, where the engineers of relevant parties work in collaboration throughout the development phase. Further, switching costs become higher after the production launch because supply chain disruptions can create a material impact to the OEM customer, as it would require cost of moving capital equipment/tooling as well as reinvesting in the development of a new system. According to Toyota, a single automobile has about 30,000 parts and any issues with a key component (for example, a faulty automotive component like Densos electronic control unit) would be costly, thus creating a strong incentive to stick to incumbent suppliers throughout the life of a car model.Intangible Assets Becoming Crucial Amid Increasing Role of CASE TechnologiesWhile switching costs allow the company to essentially lock in customers throughout an automobile models life, the companys intangible assets (track record, relationships, and consistency in product innovation) play a crucial role when it comes to developing new products and winning new business. As the automobile industry undergoes a transformation, each company will have to re-establish its intangible assets by developing new products that can position the company to be competitive in a world where CASEconnected, autonomous, shared, electrictechnologies play a significant role. The company has a history of spending heavily on R&D, averaging about 8% of sales over the past 10 years, which is similar to its narrow-moat competitor, Continental. Denso has been actively investing in CASE-related technologies. It has technical centers in seven regions across the globe, which allow the company to incorporate diversified regional needs into the companys development process; further, its advanced technology research laboratory in Japan carries out research and development in various fields with a focus on a 5- to 20-year time frame to solve long-term issues, including research on in-car semiconductors. Additionally, the company established an R&D base in the Tokyo metropolitan area for automated driving, where it focuses on the development of algorithms and software. The company also established a digital innovation department in April 2017, which serves as its information and communication technology foundation (Internet of Things, AI, Big Data, and so on), to promote development toward its focus fields on advanced safety/automated driving and connected cars. We believe Denso is well positioned to maintain its narrow moat through the increasing shift to electric vehicles, as it already commands a strong global market share with its motor generators (16%), inverters (top share with 35%), and battery engine control units (36%), which all serve as core EV technology. Further, management confirmed that ECUs and electrification systems already boast higher profit levels compared with other products and with other CASE-related businesses, like its advanced driver-assistance system business, improving profitability. We expect operating margin levels to continue improving at the companywide level as newer value-added technologies increase as a proportion of total revenue.Long-Term Record With Toyota Group Also Supports Intangible Assets Moat SourceDenso has a particularly strong relationship with Toyota Motor, which competes with Volkswagen as the worlds largest automobile OEM manufacturer by units produced. The company is also part of the Toyota Group, which is a group of companies ranging in a variety of industries that have supplier/vendor and investment relationships (involving cross-shareholdings in many cases) with Toyota Motor and/or affiliates. In the case of Denso, about 23% of its shares are owned by Toyota Motor, as of March 2023, and Denso holds about a 3% stake in Toyota Motor. Approximately half of Densos revenue is from the Toyota Group OEMs, which include Toyota Motor, Daihatsu, and Hino. As a result of being one of the core Toyota Group members, the company has a long-term record of supplying its components to these companies, and much of Denso's new technologies are supplied to group member OEMs. For example, over the recent years, Denso has been building a record with its ADAS technology, and related components are included can be found in the latest Toyota Mirai FCV and Lexus LS models.While we believe Denso stands to benefit from its long-term relationship with Toyota, we note that high concentration toward a customer company, such as Toyota Motor in Densos case, can lead to pricing pressures, which we think partially explains why Densos historical 10-year average gross margin of 16% is lower than those of narrow-moat competitors like Continental, which sees closer to 20%. Despite this, we believe a scenario of a long-term margin erosion from pricing issues with Toyota Motor is an unlikely scenario, due to our assumption that (1) the company will continue to maintain its long-term relationships with other major OEMs, including Ford, GM, BMW, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, and Subaru, which prevents a complete pricing power by any one OEM customer; (2) higher-margin products like electronic control units for EVs and heat pump products will replace earlier generation versions; and (3) Toyota Motor would stand to lose in the long run if aggressive cuts to supplier pricing is implemented, as this would likely stifle innovation initiatives as a partner in various R&D and intellectual property development initiatives. Ongoing Restructuring Initiatives and Improved Product Mix to Continue Improving ROICDenso's adjusted ROIC has improved to 10.7% in 2022, from about 2% in 2019, partly as a result of improved profitability through its restructuring efforts in Japan. While the gap between its ROIC and its weighted average cost of capital of 7.4% is small, we expect increased sales of higher margin electric vehicle products and restructuring efforts in North America/Europe will lead to higher earnings before interest growth. As such, we project ROIC to increase to 18% by 2027.Environmental, Social, and Governance RisksDenso, along with its competitors in the automobile components industry, faces medium- and long-term ESG risks related to exposure of greenhouse gas emissions of their products, as government regulations worldwide are setting deadlines on the production halt of internal combustion engine cars. The Japanese government aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 46% by 2030 from 2013 levels and eliminate gasoline-powered vehicles (excluding hybrid vehicles) by 2035, ultimately in hopes of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. With the production of gasoline-powered ICE cars gradually phasing out over the next decade, EV exposure (including BEV, FCV, and HV) will play an increasingly important role for Densos ESG risk management. From a moat perspective, we think the biggest ESG issues involve its ability to build a record of supplying environmentally friendly products that are suited for vehicle electrification and product governance that can ultimately ensure the safety of drivers. On the environmental end, our impression is that Denso has been active in addressing environmental risks over recent years, by its initiatives to develop and capitalize on the automobile electrification trend, while lowering CO2 emission levels in its production processes. As a result, the company has been included in reputable ESG indexes like the FTSE4Good and MSCI Japan ESG Leaders. Further, Denso is one of the market leaders with key automotive technologies that require energy control, like inverters (one of the core parts of EVs) and thermal systems where Denso has a 40% global share. As a subtrend within electrification, Japans recent reaffirmation of its plan to build a hydrogen society implies there is also room for FCVs in the Japanese automobile market. We think the company possessing core technologies applicable to FCVs (such as power control units) and are included in Toyotas latest Mirai FCV model, are strong signals that Denso is managing its risks by possessing and investing in various environmentally friendly technologies that can become prevalent in the long-term. We currently see limited company-specific environmental risks for Denso but clear signs of being outperformed by competitors, like Bosch and Continental, in developing a record of supplying electrification-related products over the next two years would lead us to reassess Densos current narrow moat rating.When it comes to product governance, we think Denso has company-specific factors that increase near-term ESG risks, as its realized a series of quality control provision losses from faulty products in the past, which materially affected its ROIC during these terms. Among these defects, its arguably largest issue was regarding faulty fuel pumps, which have led to engines to not start or lose power while driving (particularly at low speeds). According to Nikkei, the faulty fuel pumps have led to OEMs, including Toyota, Honda, Ford, Subaru, and others, recalling more than 10 million vehicles worldwide in aggregate, as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. The company has been working with OEMs to address this and we currently do not forecast further provision losses. However, further losses would likely affect sales to non-Toyota Group OEMs as well as ROICs, and we will consider downgrading Densos moat rating if we determine its weakening intangible assets will further damp these metrics over the medium/long term. A material loss in sales to Toyota Group OEMs from governance credibility issues would significantly increase the likelihood of a moat downgrade. We think the companys ESG risk management has improved since the mid-2010s, as the recent provision losses was a result of poor governance back then. Further, we note that during this time (mainly between fiscal 2012 and 2016), the company was also the target of anti-rust-related investigations and fines, involving several price-fixing cases as part of a cartel worldwide. We believe the biggest long-term ESG risk to Densos moat comes from how it addresses electrification trend, as products that fail to address this will not be accepted by customers and eventually become obsolete. The company has been showing progress on this end, so far, where electrification systems have more than doubled since fiscal 2015. We think Denso will be able to stabilize its moat trend by managing its ESG risks through adapting to the electrification trend, with the assumption of lowering CO2 emissions through production, and further improving product governance, but this will take a couple of years to see through.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Denso is High. The automotive components industry is capital-intensive, highly cyclical revenue, and increasingly competitive due to new market entrants amid technological shifts in the industry. Further, the increasing influence of electric vehicles and changes in consumer behavior (which ultimately drives demand) are lowering the visibility into the cash flows of automotive component manufacturers going forward. What this means for Denso is that the company must be able to continue selling its existing products (such as components for gasoline cars) to maintain short/medium-term growth, while also building a track record with new CASE technologies that contribute to its longer-term survival. Like its competitors, the company will need to continue focusing on its strengths (such as electrification and thermal technologies), while forming alliances with companies to develop technologies where its know-how is not as strong.","We rate Densos capital allocation as Standard. Over the recent years, we believe Denso has made material improvements in its capital allocation to add shareholder value. Dividends improved to JPY 185 per share in fiscal 2022 after remaining at JPY 140 over three years until 2020, and the company also underwent share buybacks at record amounts of about JPY 97 billion in 2021 and JPY 100 billion in 2022. We believe the companys R&D and investment initiatives toward CASE-related technologies are vital to support the companys ability to remain competitive and maintain its narrow economic moat. Denso has been investing about 7% of sales to R&D each year, which is similar to its competitor, Continental. We believe Densos recent investments in various automobile-related technology companies, ranging from radar/AI to mobility ICT platform companies, will complement development in areas the company is not as strong in. We believe this trend of investing in companies with key technologies will continue, as this is necessary for its long-term survival amid a significant shift in the automotive landscape.We think it is also worth noting the companys cross-shareholdings with Toyota Motor. While this is a common business practice for many Japanese companies with a long history, we believe this can affect Densos competitiveness on a global level, as Toyota Motor (Densos largest customer by sales) owns approximately 24% of Densos shares while Denso holds only holds a 3% stake in Toyota Motor. Denso will have to continue balancing potential conflicts of interest between itself as well as other shareholders in the Toyota Group, as the crossholdings can weaken Densos negotiating leverage with its largest customer and shareholder, as well as hinder sales to competitors outside the Toyota Group. However, with the exception of fiscal 2019 and 2020 (due to mainly one-time adverse factors like the pandemic and trade friction between the U.S. and China), the company has been able to generate positive economic profits over the long term, which we see as a sign that its long-term relationships within the group has benefited Denso overall.","Denso manufactures automotive components and systems, as well as other industrial products and home appliances. The company was founded in 1949 as a result of becoming independent from Toyota Motor, which is currently the largest shareholder with 24.75% ownership. Its main businesses are powertrain control systems, thermal systems, electrification systems, mobility systems, and sensors/semiconductor systems for mainly hybrid, internal combustion engine, battery electric, and fuel cell vehicles. The company operates globally and is headquartered in Kariya, Japan.","Although Denso is no longer in a net cash position, in fiscal 2022, net debt/EBITDA remains low at 0.15. Since 2012 and onward, the company has been able to self-fund its investments through its cash flow from operations, and we expect this to continue. Going forward, we expect further improvements in free cash flow generation, as the company continues to make progress on its restructuring initiatives, sell higher margin products, and components/logistics costs revert to prepandemic levels over the medium term.",6902.T,Consumer Cyclical,6756395122688.0,JPX,9255200.0,JPY,2425.5,True,0,2421.7804878048782,2425.493670886076,0

Total sales were up 3.3% year over year, largely thanks to price and mix, which contributed to 7.1% of total growth with 3.5% offset from volume loss. Management trimmed the top end of full-year sales guidance by 100 basis points after citing a soft outlook for the fourth quarter, driven by a weaker cold and flu season, as well as more challenging foreign exchange impact. We updated our near-term assumptions, but impacts from adjustments were not material and we maintain our fair value estimate of $27.50 per share. Kenvue continues to boast strong pricing power, with all three of its segments posting mid-single-digit value realization (defined by the firm as impacts from price and mix). While it is difficult to parse out what percentage of that growth comes purely from price, we see Kenvue benefiting from price actions taken earlier this year. It also has consistently shown its ability to pass high input costs over to its customers and gain shares in the market thanks to its strong brand intangibles. Self care, Kenvue's largest product segment, continues to put out strong performance, with this quarter's sales up 6.4% year over year. Despite having a portfolio of mature brands, Kenvue continues to roll out new innovationsfor example, Motrin Dual Action, a product that combines core ingredients from Motrin and Tylenol, was recently launched, and Nicorette secured an indication for vaping cessation in the United Kingdom. We see this as fuel for the segment and one of the key attributes that reaffirms the firm's wide moat. Having said that, we are forecasting weaker fourth-quarter sales for the segment because it is lapping last year's atypically strong flu season. But we see this as a near-term hiccup in an otherwise strong business.","With autonomy from its former parent, Kenvue can allocate resources to best fit its needs and grow the business. Macro drivers like an aging population and premiumization of health care will act as tailwinds for all of Kenvues brands. Kenvues continued focus on digital advertising and marketing will keep the company well-positioned to fend off any new competitors in e-commerce.","As rising input costs put pressure on Kenvue to hike prices, consumers could start to seek cheaper options or private label offerings, hurting Kenvues volumes. Personalization of health paves way for smaller niche players to carve out their shares of the market with bespoke offerings. Kenvue will have a tough time fighting for these areas given the difficulty of catering to these consumers with their megabrands. Talc litigation has caused considerable damage to Johnsons reputation and it could be difficult for Kenvue to win over lost customers despite replacing talc with cornstarch.",20/07/2023,"Kenvue is the worlds largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue, generating $15 billion in annual sales. Formerly known as Johnson & Johnsons consumer segment, Kenvue spun off and went public in May 2023. We expect Kenvue, with the freedom to allocate capital and invest as a standalone entity, to mainly focus on growing its 15 priority brands (including Tylenol, Nicorette, Listerine, and Zyrtec) to drive future growth. We forecast the company to spend roughly 3% of sales in research and development, on par with some of its wide-moat competitors, to launch innovative products, specifically in digital consumer health. Recent examples include the Nicorette QuickMist SmartTrack spray and Zyrtec AllergyCast app.  Kenvue has been rationalizing its portfolio through a reduction in a number of stock-keeping units and business selloffs (15 divestitures from 2016-22). Now that most of this optimization is behind us, we expect a more agile portfolio. Macro factors such as an aging population, premiumization of consumer health care products, and growing emerging markets should provide tailwinds for Kenvues wide array of brands. We also expect Kenvue to benefit from an increasing digital investment71% of companys marketing spending in 2022 was digital versus 44% in 2019as this should fuel both e-commerce as well as in-person store sales.  We expect margin expansion from two channels: favorable pricing dynamics and improving supply chain efficiencies. Our analysis tells us that Kenvue has been able to stay ahead of its markets in terms of price hikes and we expect this trend to continue thanks to its products strong brand power. During inflationary environment, we have seen Kenvue astutely pass over rising costs through robust price hikes (high-single-digit during first quarter of 2023) and we expect a similar level of pricing adjustments for the rest of the year. We also expect cost savings over the next five years from supply chain optimization initiatives as Kenvue dedicates roughly 60% of capital expenditures to automation and digitalization of its manufacturing and distribution network, improving end-to-end integration. ","We assign Kenvue a wide moat because we believe the companys strong brand reputation and customer loyalty (intangible assets) as well as significant economies of scale (cost advantage) should continue to support economic profits for at least the next 20 years. By our analysis, Kenvue has consistently achieved a return on invested capital including goodwill) in the low teens over the last decade, higher than our estimate of its weighted average cost of capital of 7.3%, and we believe the company will be able to maintain a similar level of ROIC for the next 20 years. Kenvue has five brands that generate over $1 billion in salesJohnsons, Neutrogena, Listerine, Tylenol, and Aveenoas well as a number of brands that generate over $400 million in salesNicorette, Zyrtec, Band-Aid, Benadryl, Motrin, and OGX. Many of Kenvues brands boast strong brand power and have outgrown their respective market over the past decade. In fact, some of Kenvues brands have such strong brand recognition that they are synonymous with their generic names. Notable examples include Tylenol (generic name: acetaminophen) and Band-Aid (generic name: adhesive bandage). All of Kenvues top brands are market leaders in their respective categories in North America: Nicorette (controls 48%), Listerine (45%), Imodium (36%), Band-Aid (34%), Johnsons (26%), and Tylenol (16%). Kenvues brands have also held their market leadership for over a decade (2013 is earliest data available on Euromonitor), demonstrating stability of their market share. Lastly, Kenvues brands do not have a meaningful competitor in most markets and the rest of space is shared among minor brands and private labels that have no significant shares. One of the main reasons for Kenvues market outperformance, in our opinion, is the significant brand power and customer loyalty its brands have amassed, with decades of history on the shelf and inside peoples homes. Listerine first became commercially available in 1914, Band-Aid in 1921, and Tylenol in 1955, so Kenvues brands reputation, which is underpinned by their long-standing history, is difficult to replicate. We also believe a number of Kenvues brands (Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec, Band-Aid, and Benadryl) are sought out in times of poor health, so the importance of brand familiarity and trust is heightened. And because Kenvues brands are backed by years of scientific research, they benefit from recommendations of professionals across its mix of products. For example, Nicorette is the number one doctor- and pharmacist-recommended smoking cessation brand and Listerine is the number one dentist-recommended mouthwash in the U.S. Many of Kenvues brands come at a moderate to significant pricing premium when compared with their close competitors and that premium is magnified when compared with private labels. But even at higher prices, we see that consumers continue to choose Kenvues brands over their competitors. Furthermore, Kenvue is able to stay ahead of the industry in terms of pricingconsistently raising prices higher than a brands group average. The leading market share in many of the categories it plays in, even at higher prices, illustrates Kenvues strong brand reputation and a high level of consumer trust and loyalty. To ensure its brand prowess and to maintain its leading position, Kenvue spends roughly 4% of sales on research and development and 10% on advertising and marketing, on par with its wide-moat competitor Procter & Gamble (3% and 11% of sales on research and development, and A&M, respectively). We believe Kenvue can maintain its leading share position and entrenched standing with retailers through product innovation thanks to an extensive level of research that it conducts in many spaces it operates in. For example, since 2009 Kenvue (and Johnson & Johnson) generated more than 90% of industry-sponsored research on baby skin care and it also leads in mouthwash research. We believe the knowledge that is gained through these studies is instrumental in Kenvue launching products that are well-received by consumers and maintaining its market leadership, demonstrated by its number one spot in global baby toiletries and global mouthwash industry. We believe through its impressive scale and global footprint, Kenvue has garnered favorable relationships with its suppliers and achieved significant economies of scale that smaller competitors are not able to achieve. Given the market dominance that many of Kenvues brands enjoy, we contend that retailers rely on Kenvues products to drive traffic in their stores, upholding our belief that Kenvue is a category captain in many product channels. A category captain recommends optimal product mix, promotional strategies, and product placement, and both the captain and retailers share data and analysis. This is a critical competitive advantage for large manufacturers, not only over new entrants and small players, but also in intra-category competition among the leading three or four brands, as it helps the category captain retain prime real estate in the store. Such relationships are mutually beneficial, with the vendor becoming an essential retail partner, developing sales strategies to maximize volume and retailers margins while prioritizing its own brands. In our view, trusted manufacturers like Kenvue, which operate with a wide array of consumer health products, are critical to retailers that are reluctant to risk costly out-of-stocks with unproven suppliers. We also see Kenvue enjoying cost advantages, although we concede that evidence of this moat source is weaker compared with what we see for intangible assets. We view customer acquisition costs as a critical metric to assess cost advantages for CPG manufacturers and believe Kenvue has excelled on this front. Kenvue has grown at the pace of or more quickly than the industry while spending less on advertising and marketing (10% of total sales versus industry average of 15% of total sales) which helps the company post higher returns compared with its competitors. Furthermore, slotting fees present a challenge to CPG manufacturers, especially for upstart enterprises, and we believe Kenvue is well positioned to exercise its scale to negotiate favorable slotting fees and fend off any new entries from stealing their shelf space.","We assign Kenvue a Medium uncertainty rating, which largely reflects our quantitative analysis of the firm based on the return ranges used by our star rating system and somewhat the competitiveness of consumer health industry.While Kenvue maintains a leading position in many industries it plays in, barriers to entry are low and some markets are constantly susceptible to new competition. This is especially the case in an increasingly digital environment where a player can easily introduce new competing products without having to displace industry leaders from retail shelf space. However, we believe Kenvue is well positioned to insulate itself more or less from new entrants thanks to a long-standing history of many of its brands as well as its entrenched relationship with retailers (brick and mortar as well as online stores) and with consumers. We dont see any material environmental, social, and governance issues that can materially impact Kenvue in imminent future. Johnson & Johnsons consumer segment faced serious litigation around Johnsons baby powder and many consumers argued that talc, the products main ingredient, caused cancer. The litigation, which first started in 2013, has involved nearly 70,000 plaintiffs and J&J reached a final deal in April 2023 when it agreed to pay $8.9 billion to people who filed claims with the settlement to be paid out over 25 years. In 2023, J&J discontinued all talc-based Johnsons powder and replaced them with cornstarch-based powder. Any future talc-related litigation will be fully handled by J&J with no impact on Kenvue so we decided not to penalize Kenvues uncertainty rating regarding this matter. But given its historical context, we remain on the lookout for any potential issues with Kenvues products, including resource use, recalls, and allegations of price fixing, in the future.","We assign Kenvue a Standard capital allocation rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our view of Kenvues sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We view Kenvues balance sheet as sound. Kenvues balance sheet is highly leveraged but the debt was mainly raised in relation to the separation from its former parent and we expect the company to fully prioritize paying down this debt once the full separation is executed. At the end of 2022, Kenvues debt/EBITDA was 2.72, but we forecast this figure to drop below 1.5 by 2027 from a mix of lowered debt balance and a higher EBITDA from a growing top line and improving margins. We view Kenvues investments as fair. While the company has not made any acquisitions as a standalone entity yet, we view as fair the history of acquisitions and divestitures that the consumer division of Johnson & Johnson has. From 2016-22, the division completed 10 acquisitions (most notably OGX, Zarbees, and Dr.Ci: Labo) and 15 divestitures (including RoC, Nizoral, Compeed, and Baby Center). We believe these transactions were all part of active optimization of Kenvues portfolio which we now view as more agile and refined. While we dont foresee any big acquisitions in the near future, we expect Kenvue to be open to smaller tuck-in acquisitions over the next five years.We view Kenvues shareholder distribution as appropriate. Kenvue noted that it expects to pay quarterly cash dividends of approximately $0.20 per share starting third quarter of 2023. Annualizing this for 2024 gives us an approximate dividend payout ratio of 60%, which is consistent with J&Js payout ratio. The former parent averaged a payout ratio of 60% over the last 10 years. We expect this high level of payout ratio to be maintained. Once full separation is executed, we also expect Kenvue could return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. While we are not currently modeling any repurchases over the next five years given the uncertainty of timing, we remain on the lookout for any future guidance on this front. Kenvue is led by Thibaut Mongon, whom we view as a trustworthy leader for the new company. Mongon joined J&J more than 23 years ago and has had experience in both medical devices and pharmaceutical segments of the company. Mongon started his career in J&J consumer division in 2014 and became the worldwide chairman of the division in 2019 before moving to Kenvue as the chief executive officer. With almost a decade of experience in J&Js consumer business, we believe Mongon will be able to effectively steer the company in the right direction. ","Kenvue is the worlds largest pure-play consumer health company by sales, generating $15 billion in annual revenue. Formerly known as Johnson & Johnsons consumer segment, Kenvue spun off and went public in May 2023. It operates in a variety of silos within consumer health, such as cough, cold and allergy care, pain management, face and body care, and oral care, as well as womens health. Its portfolio includes a wide array of some of the most well-known brands in the space, including Tylenol, Listerine, Johnsons, Aveeno, and Neutrogena. Despite playing in a fragmented industry with intense competition and ever-changing consumer preferences, many of Kenvues brands are the global leader in their respective segment thanks to their strong brand power. ","We believe Kenvue is in fine financial health. In March 2023, Kenvue issued senior unsecured notes of $7.75 billion and $1.25 billion of outstanding commercial paper, both relating to the separation from Johnson & Johnson. Despite the large debt balance compared with its current level of cash ($1.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2022), we expect healthy cash generation from Kenvue to meet all of its near-future financial obligations. Only $1.5 billion of debt is expected to expire in the next five years, which we believe the company can more than cover. It generated $2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 (roughly 13% of sales) and we forecast $2.9 billion of free cash flow by 2027 (roughly 16% of sales). While we are not modeling any big acquisitions in the near future, we see Kenvue eyeing smaller tuck-in acquisitions over the next five years as a possible scenario. Notable recent acquisitions include purchase of Dr.Ci:Labo (a Japanese skin care brand; $1.6 billion) in 2019, OGX (a personal care brand with a focus in shampoos, conditioners, and body care products; $3.3 billion) in 2016, and Neostrata (a dermocosmetics brand focused on anti-aging products; undisclosed) in 2016. We see all three of these purchases as Kenvues step into a premium and personalized healthcare space and we expect future acquisitions to further bolster the companys portfolio in skin health and beauty segment.",KVUE,Consumer Defensive,39619076096.0,NYQ,16953890.0,USD,20.040000915527344,True,1,21.159058784035295,20.4061728348,0
24/11/2023,"Switch Shipment in Line, Zelda Movie Development Is Positive Long Term to Develop Fan Base",Nintendo Co Ltd,7974,3,21/11/2023,Kazunori Ito,6854.0,JPY,24/11/2023,7000.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,21/11/2023,"Although Nintendos September-quarter revenue and operating income were below our expectations due to the lower shipments of first-party games, we are not changing our fair value estimate for Nintendo of JPY 7,000, as total game and console shipment numbers were largely in line with our forecasts. While the quarter lacked strong title launches that directly impact Nintendos earnings, the announcement of the development of a live-action film of The Legend of Zelda was a highlight. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendos most iconic IPs, with the first game released in 1986, and the latest game, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, having shipped 19.5 million units since its launch in May. Although the movie is not expected to be released for several years and will not have a direct impact on Nintendos earnings, we expect it to play a role in expanding the fan base of Nintendos characters in the long run, as did the Super Mario Bros. Movie released earlier this year. We view Nintendos shares as fairly valued. Switchs game shipments for the quarter were 44.9 million, which is in line with our expectation of 46 million. This is a 17% decrease from the previous year, which seems like a significant slowdown given that shipments were up 26% in the June quarter, but we note the impact of the big titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which launched in the June quarter this year, and Splatoon 3, which launched in the September quarter of last year, making the game shipments look a bit bumpy. Overall, total game shipments for the last two quarters were up 1.8% year on year. The company raised its game shipment guidance for fiscal 2023 (ending March 2024) to 185 million from 180 million, which still seems to be conservative. We expect game shipments of 195 million for this fiscal year. ","The value of Nintendos popular characters has not been damaged, and they will help to expand the user base. The turnover of the game console business will succeed, as Nintendo will deliver its new hardware at an affordable price point with a greater volume of attractive software. Nintendo currently focuses on delivering a fun gaming experience through its IP, and no longer restricts its content to its original platform.","While its characters are popular, most of Nintendos earnings are still constrained by its own hardware shipments. People could be satisfied with Nintendo games provided on smartphones, and might decide not to purchase its hardware. Tough competition in the game industry will force Nintendo to cut the price of hardware, which may continue to damage its profitability.",21/11/2023,"We believe that Nintendos policy change in 2014 is offering the firm a new growth opportunity, through not limiting its popular characters to game consoles, but expanding them to other platformssuch as launching smartphone games, allowing Universal Studios to use its characters, launching animation movies, and selling figurines. Mario is the best video game character in the world, appearing in more than 200 titles since 1981 and selling more than 600 million games throughout its history. At the closing ceremony of Rio Olympics in 2014, the Japanese prime minister dressed up as Super Mario to promote the Tokyo Olympics, which suggests that Mario is not only a popular video game character but also an icon of Japans entertainment. Super Mario Run, the first Mario game to be launched on smartphones, recorded more than 300 million downloads, followed by more than 100 million downloads of Mario Kart Tour. Pokemon is another popular franchise from Nintendo, which has a history of over 20 years and has sold more than 480 million games and 28 billion trading cards. Pokemon Go has provided a new user experience through augmented reality, or AR, and recorded more than 1 billion downloads. Pokemon Go has also attained five Guinness World Records for revenue and download numbers. We believe Nintendos fans will increase as people are able to enjoy its characters on various occasions, and that the success of the Switch platform proves Nintendo can induce new fans to its ecosystem by leveraging its characters and preparing attractive game pipeline. Future challenges for the company will be: 1) Whether the company can monetize its characters efficiently on non-console business, 2) Whether re-entry to the greater China market will succeed, and 3) How the company can adapt to the diffusion of the cloud gaming platform. We nevertheless believe the companys ability to deliver fun games through its characters is intact.","We assign Nintendo a wide moat rating, which is underpinned by its strong intellectual property. Nintendo has been in the game console business for 40 years, since the company launched its first game console, the NES, in 1983. In that time, Nintendo has established many franchises, including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Mario Kart, and Animal Crossing. Many of these series have been played for 20 to 30 years or longer, through 10 or even more sequels, and have been played by three generations. We believe that these characters Nintendo has built throughout its history will differentiate the company from others and generate excess returns for at least the next two decades. We forecast an average operating margin of 29.8% and ROIC of 66.6% over the next five years.While Nintendo sells game consoles, we estimate that more than 80% of its gross margin comes from the software, and since 75%-80% of Nintendos software revenue comes from its own games (the rest is from third-party titles), how Nintendo itself continues to deliver attractive games will be critical to its financials. From this perspective, we believe that Nintendo is one of the few premier game developers with a stellar longer-term track record of creating and maintaining franchises. For example, if we look at the sales rankings of Nintendos games in fiscal 2022, the best-selling game, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, was the ninth game in the series, which began in 1996. Similarly, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the fourth-best-selling game in fiscal 2022, is the eighth game in the series, which began in 1992. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which sold 10 million copies in just three days after its release in May 2023, is the 19th game in the series that began in 1986. As such, more than half of Nintendos first-party titles consist of established, classic franchises, enabling the company to generate solid and consistent excess returns. Due to the strong brand power of the characters themselves, we do not believe that changes in the game industry will affect Nintendos ROIC in the long term. For example, Super Mario Bros. has been released on a variety of platforms since its launch in 1985. Although Mario, originally drawn in just 16x16 pixels, has become a 3D character, the basic concept and the excitement of Super Mario games have remained the same. Mario is also the icon of other flagship games such as Mario Kart and Mario Party. So even as platforms and technologies change, Nintendo has an impressive track record of delivering exciting game experiences without compromising the Mario image, and we believe this will continue in the future. Another good example is Pokemon GO, a mobile game that successfully integrates AR technology and Nintendos characters.Since 2014, Nintendo has focused on a strategy to increase touch points with users by introducing its famous characters across different mediums. A recent example of this is The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which was released in April 2023 and has earned more than USD 1.3 billion at the global box office as of August 2023, becoming the 15th highest-grossing movie in the history. This further demonstrates how well known Mario is around the world and supports our view that its strong brand power will continue for at least for more than two decades. The other example is Pokemon Go, an augmented reality mobile game launched in 2016 in collaboration with Niantic, which has been downloaded more than 1 billion times. Considering that the number of active users of Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4/5 is around 100 million each, the release of the mobile app has enabled a wider range of users to play with Pokemon characters. The final example is Super Nintendo World, opened in collaboration with Universal Studios in Japan in 2021, followed by Hollywood in 2023, with additional parks scheduled to open in Orlando and Singapore in 2025. While these franchises do not directly contribute heavily to Nintendos revenue, they do play a role in bringing more people into the Nintendos ecosystem. In fact, the sales of Switch consoles and Mario-related games have increased since the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. More than anything, these deals are testaments that Nintendos characters have established strong brand power and that the company will continue to aggressively leverage them.In the past, changes in console generations have been a risk factor for Nintendo. The success of one platform did not necessarily translate into the success of the next as new consoles were not backward compatible, and thus the user base had to be built from scratch each time. However, we do not believe that this will be a material risk for Nintendo in the future, as Nintendo now offers individual accounts and monthly subscription programs, and games are now downloaded to consoles rather than purchased as physical cards (about half of game sales are digital downloads), making it easier to transfer past game assets and personal settings to the new platform, creating more stickiness to the ecosystem. In fact, competitor Sony is successfully transitioning from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 without significantly affecting the number of active users and game sales, which has not been the case in previous transitions. As a result, we believe that the risks associated with generation changes in game consoles are smaller than ever before.Moreover, we believe that console competition will not have a material long-term impact on Nintendos ROIC because Nintendos strength is in its games, but not its consoles. In other words, people who want to play with Nintendos characters buy Nintendos consoles. Nintendo does operate a console platform, but for Nintendo, consoles have only been a means to deliver its gaming experience to a wider audience. In fact, Nintendo ceased production of the Nintendo 3DS, the last portable console, and integrated its two core platforms (home console and portable console) in 2020, as focusing its resources on one platform was the best way to maximize Nintendos user base. Similarly, if consoles were to disappear and cloud gaming were to become the mainstream due to technological developments or other factors, Nintendo will not hesitate to discontinue operating its own console and start selling its games on other platforms, if it believes this would be the best way to deliver Nintendos unique and enjoyable experiences to the greatest number of people. As mentioned above, 75%-80% of Nintendos software revenue comes from its own software and is less dependent on third-party games compared with other platforms. Therefore, the exit from the console business, if it were to happen, would have a limited impact on Nintendos ability to generate excess returns.Although it is difficult to predict which game will be well received by the users, we believe that Nintendo will be able to generate a more stable excess return by leveraging its rich game assets. As mentioned above, Nintendo decided to focus its resources on the ongoing Switch platform, after more than 30 years of operating two different platforms (home and portable consoles) since the launch of the Game Boy in 1989. This will allow Nintendo to consistently release two to three classic killer titles each year, which will help mitigate the cyclicality and uncertainty of the business. For example, Pokemon and Animal Crossing are franchises that were primarily released on the portable platform, while The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Super Smash Bros. are well-known as home console titles. The integration of these two has made the Switch pipeline more compelling than ever, and as a result, we forecast that the Switch console lifetime shipments will reach 160 million, surpassing the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2 to become the highest ever for a game console. We expect Nintendo to leverage its strong game lineup to maintain this strong user base and maintain excess returns for more than 20 years.","We assign Nintendo a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. While we had been concerned about the very high volatility of the gaming industry, we are encouraged that Nintendos integration of two platforms (home and portable consoles) has enabled it to release first-party games more consistently each year than before.As a net exporter from Japan, Nintendo is vulnerable to movements in foreign-exchange rates. While the company tries to purchase some of its components in U.S. dollars to offset the volatility of the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate, its revenue and profits are directly affected by the movements of the Japanese yen/euro exchange rate. Competition from other game platforms is a risk factor for Nintendo. However, we think the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S are designed for older players, as games on those consoles feature high-resolution graphics and rich audio content, targeting different segments. Mobile games may be direct competitors for the company's products. To address this problem, Nintendo has decided to provide its internet protocol to smartphones. We think that launching its IP on smartphones will help expand Nintendos user base, as more people will be able to use its content. We do not think Nintendo faces any material, company-specific risks that may have an impact on our economic moat rating and Uncertainty Rating. Poor environmental, social, and governance risk management may lead to direct and indirect costs related to data leakage problems, as the companys business is shifting from being hardware-focused to providing its content online. For instance, in 2011, the personal data of 77 million accounts on Sonys PlayStation network was compromised, which became one of the largest data security breaches. Based on this issue, Nintendo pays attention to data security to protect its intellectual property and customer data, and as a result, we have not acknowledged any material issues over the past decade.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Nintendo is Standard.Owing to the high volatility of the game console business, Nintendo tends to hold rich cash and has had no debt in its balance sheet for years, in order to prepare for a potential downturn. While we understand this policy, the pace of cash accumulation has accelerated over the past few years due to the greater-than-expected success of the Switch console. Nintendos gross margin for software revenue is quite high due to the high proportion of first-party games, and the fixed cost is relatively low as the business does not require heavy capital expenditure. Therefore, Nintendo tends to pile up cash during upturns.Nintendo is paying out either 1) 50% of net income or 2) 33% of operating income, whichever is higher as dividends. Furthermore, in addition to the regular dividends, the company declared to pay special dividends in fiscal 2020 (financial year-end March 2021) as its operating margin recorded a historical high, and in the following quarter, Nintendo decided to buy back 1.51% of outstanding shares. Although we are not fully satisfied that Nintendo is reluctant to make aggressive acquisitions to enhance its software IP, we are encouraged to a certain extent as the company is becoming more flexible on shareholder returns in response to market demands.","Nintendo started its video game console business in 1983 by launching the NES, and started its portable console business in 1989 by launching the Game Boy. Since then, the firm has focused on expanding the gaming population by delivering unique entertainment experiences on its original console systems; the Wii and Nintendo DS are its most popular hardware. However, Nintendo not only makes game consoles, but also owns world-renowned IPs such as Super Mario, Pokemon, and Zelda, which have been a source of cash flow for 40 years. 2020 was the 35th anniversary of Super Mario, Nintendo's most famous character.","Nintendos capital structure is composed of equity with no debt. Similar to its peers, Nintendos business model does require research and development, or R&D, and advertising expense, but on the other hand, heavy investment for fixed assets is not necessary. Therefore, the majority of its assets are cash equivalents and investments, which have accumulated as a result of Nintendos long success in the game industry. In fact, Nintendo possesses JPY 909 billion of net cash, while its total assets amount to JPY 1.3 trillion. As Nintendo does not possess many fixed assets, most of its costs are variable. Therefore, it can control R&D and advertising expense whenever necessary. In conclusion, although we acknowledge that game production is a competitive and cyclical industry, we think Nintendos balance sheet and cash flows are sufficiently healthy to endure economic fluctuations for a certain period.",7974.T,Communication Services,7933063069696.0,JPX,2692800.0,JPY,6854.0,True,0,6342.317073170731,7814.670886075949,1
24/11/2023,Sonic Automotive Will Be Less Focused on Acquisitions in 2023 Than Recent Years,Sonic Automotive Inc,SAH,3,17/11/2023,David Whiston,52.25,USD,23/11/2023,61.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,17/11/2023,"At the Los Angeles auto show on Nov. 16, Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon in which, starting next year, some of its dealers will sell new vehicles on Amazon.com. The news sent each of the six franchise dealers and CarMax down about 5%-8%, which we think is a large overreaction predicated on fears of Amazon taking share away from dealers. Such a risk is not even possible on new vehicle sales due to state franchise laws, nor do we think it is likely that Amazon wants to do all aspects of auto retailing such as handling and disposing of trade-ins, service, and finance and insurance offerings. Service is a very underappreciated benefit that dealers provide customers when comparing the traditional auto industry to digital retailing and electric vehicle startups' direct sales formats. Should Amazon directly sell used vehicles someday, CarMax would have more competition, but it also has the ability to sell via brick-and-mortar, digital-only, or any combination of both depending on what the customer wants, something a digital-only retailer cannot offer. Our auto coverage has been implementing omnichannel tools for years and we doubt that any of their management teams are surprised by the Amazon news. Details, especially around economics, are thin, but Automotive News cited a Hyundai spokesperson who said starting in January, only 18 Hyundai dealers will partner with Amazon, with that number expanding in the second half of the year. Prominent LA auto dealer Mike Sullivan joined Hyundai and Amazon in the presentation to say the dealer will still be the seller of record and reiterated other customer benefits that dealers provide like services. Its possible this arrangement is a larger version of Costcos auto program that provides members the ability to buy a new or used vehicle from over 3,000 dealers of various brands.","Auto dealerships are well-diversified businesses that have lucrative parts and servicing operations, which help them be profitable in almost any environment. EchoPark could prove to be a very lucrative business this decade if it can scale up. Sonic has the potential to generate significant economies of scale as vehicle demand rebounds and if EchoPark grows. Powersports may be a lucrative new business as well given it does not have many large rollup players in it like auto dealerships do.","Dealerships are prone to macroeconomic cycles, and the pandemic and semiconductor shortages continue to hurt new vehicle inventory availability and in turn compressing used vehicle profit. EchoPark is a major investment and may not succeed if execution stumbles. The Smith family has about 85% voting power, so other shareholders are effectively just along for the ride.",28/07/2023,"Sonic Automotive is undergoing many changes. Rollout of its omnichannel Digital One Stop process and the CarCash app allows consumers to shop digitally or in-store and helps Sonic procure more used-vehicle inventory. Management has also worked to make the car-buying process nearly paperless, place the customer with only one person for the entire transaction, and enable the customer to take delivery of a vehicle in an hour or less after deciding which one to buy. It's now building out a powersports segment which for now will likely focus on motorcycle stores such as Harley-Davidson. In October 2013, Sonic announced its intention to compete with CarMax in used vehicles with EchoPark used-vehicle stores. The U.S. used-vehicle market is highly fragmented at about 40 million units a year, with late-model used vehicles as old as six years often making up at least 15 million units. Openings started in late 2014 in the Denver area and at year-end 2022, the EchoPark segment had about 50 stores and delivery centers in 21 states and targeted reaching 90% of the U.S. population by 2025. After temporarily closing all 14 delivery centers and 11 stores in June 2023 due to low late-model inventory supply, the EchoPark segment has 25 stores. It will take time for EchoPark to reach scale. The stores will not have a big-box retail format and are not capital-intensive due to most eventually being delivery and buy centers that only cost $1 million-$2 million each. These centers will be served by larger hub stores in a region that each cost between $7 million and $25 million. EchoPark will not do home delivery. Sonic does not plan a captive finance arm like CarMax enjoys. Good growth is not impossible in our view because EchoPark intentionally undercuts competitors on price, then recovers a small loss on the vehicle by arranging loans with third-party lenders and selling extended warranties, targeting over $2,000 gross profit per unit. Sonic has scale relative to a small dealer and can get better terms from vendors for supplies, computer systems, and health insurance compared with a small dealer. It also captures lucrative service work over repair shops through its warranty business.","We are maintaining our narrow moat rating, as Sonic's size continues to generate economies of scale and working capital efficiencies while the service segment's warranty work gives the company an intangible advantage over garages. We think the dealer sector is the best business in the automotive supply chain. The public dealers can centralize back-office operations and generate far more volume than small dealers, which brings scale. Dealers have no burdensome retiree expenses, and the large public dealers don't depend on the health of one brand. The dealers enjoy mid- to high-single-digit gross margins on new vehicles and 100% gross margins on financing and insurance. We think the best source of competitive advantage is the parts and service operations. Many customers bring their vehicle to the dealer for servicing because either the vehicle is under warranty or the dealer is close to home and has the factory parts and expertise to service the vehicle. Once vehicle owners know a dealer, we think they are likely to keep going back to the dealer for service. The dealer knows the vehicle, and comparison-shopping for repair work is very time-consuming since the customer has to take the vehicle to each shop to get a quote. These cost advantages and intangible advantages from service give dealers a moat.These logistics create inelasticity of demand, which creates pricing power for the dealer and is a source of excellent profit in good times and bad. In fact, during a downturn in new-vehicle sales, dealers generally report higher gross margins due to a favorable mix shift, but then report lower operating margins because of SG&A deleveraging. Excluding large impairment and restructuring charges, dealers can still report positive EBIT even in a severe recession. Although most dealerships are good businesses, we think the large publicly traded dealers are best positioned for growth since they can be the most flexible in changing brand mix. Many small business owners are choosing to exit or sell because they cannot get the scale on a variety of expenses compared with large dealer groups.","Our Fair Value Uncertainty Rating for Sonic is High. Like all the large public dealerships, Sonic pursues a roll-up strategy so it relies on acquisitions for part of its growth, though not as much recently as the other public dealers due to the EchoPark strategy. EchoPark has temporarily closed stores due to lack of late model used vehicle inventory, but we expect those stores to reopen in 2024. The large RFJ deal brings acquisition risk. There is always the risk that the company will overpay for a deal. The company mitigates this risk by avoiding bidding wars with its competitors. Sonic gets over 20% of consolidated revenue from California, where consumers in the past have been hurt by a collapse in housing prices. Sonic also gets about half of total revenue from Texas and California.Sonics main ESG focus for us is that its controlled by the founding Smith family, which, until his June 2022 death at age 95, was led by executive chairman Bruton Smith. The Smiths also control Speedway Motorsports, which owns and operates a number of NASCAR tracks. Bruton's son Scott was Sonics CEO, but another son, David, 48, took over as CEO in 2018 and has been with Sonic since 1998. Their brother Marcus joined the board in 2019. The family uses a dual share class structure (Class B shares have 10 votes) to maintain control and as of March 2023 the Smith brothers, through direct and indirect holdings, have about 85% voting power. David is now chairman and Scott rejoined the board in July 2022. Family control can raise succession issues, but we also feel if the family wanted an outsider to be CEO that President Jeff Dyke, 55, could handle the job well. Dyke joined Sonic in 2005 from AutoNation, became head of operations in 2008, president in 2018, and joined the board in July 2019. Based on earnings calls over the years, we get the impression Dyke is heavily involved with the EchoPark stand-alone used-vehicle stores.","We award Sonic a Standard capital allocation rating based on its balance sheet health, investment choices, and shareholder distributions. The balance sheet looks to be in good shape to us with the largest non-floorplan debt maturity through 2027 being $291.9 million due in November 2027, mostly from a mortgage line maturing that November. After that the next large maturity is in November 2029 when $650 million of 4.625% notes mature and another $500 million of 4.875% notes mature in November 2031. These notes were issued to help pay for the RFJ deal and to redeem $250 million of 6.125% 2027 notes. We like that management took advantage of the low interest rate environment in fall 2021 to fund a transformative acquisition and EchoPark growth with long term debt. The company also has $302.6 million of mortgage notes due at various times through 2033, with about 60% of them at fixed rates. We expect solid free cash flow generation for most of our forecast period. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at June 30 is only 2.01 times, down from 3.68 times in 2017, but we do expect the ratio to increase somewhat over time from here via either more debt to fund another large acquisition or profits coming down from likely unmaintainable 2021 and 2022 levels due to pricing power from the chip shortage gradually subsiding.Historically, Sonic had often been able to generate a slight economic profit, but investments in digital and EchoPark, along with ongoing capital spending led to return on invested capital staying below the weighted average cost of capital for several years prior to 2020. With EchoPark now starting to get traction, we expect an economic profit throughout our forecast period. EchoPark will likely continue to be the main investment for management but we do expect $600 million to $800 million of annual acquired revenue on the franchise side, on top of the $3.2 billion acquired in December 2021 via RFJ, as the sector continues to slowly consolidate in favor of the largest dealers. Sonic has at times differed from the other dealers we cover by not pursuing acquisitions on the franchise side as heavily due to EchoPark, but we dont mind given EchoPark can have four to five times the used vehicle volume of the franchise business. In mid-2021 however, management indicated that it is feeling more able to do franchise acquisitions given EchoPark is starting to ramp up. For decades until recently, we believe that the franchise dealers have not spent enough time and effort to retail used vehicles at the best possible profit and we see no reason Sonic cannot grow EchoPark to at least low-double-digit billions in revenue, up from $1.4 billion in 2020 and $2.5 billion in 2022. We respect management's honesty in July 2022 of withdrawing EchoPark's 2025 revenue target of $14 billion due to low supply of 1-4-year-old vehicles.We expect a dividend to be the main shareholder distribution due to the Smith familys control to us likely meaning they want a payout. The dividend stayed flat in 2020 versus 2019 but increased 20% in 2021 to $0.12 a quarter and more than doubled in February 2022 to $0.25 a quarter. In early 2023 the board raised the payout again to $0.28 and again in the spring to $0.29. We see reinvesting in the business for initiatives like EchoPark remaining the top priority. We like that the dividend was not touched despite the pandemic which shows management did not overreact to the crisis. Management also increased the share repurchase authorization in July 2020 by $60 million and bought back more shares after that in the $30s, which we like and bucks the ""cash is king"" mantra we normally hear throughout our coverage in times of crisis. A $250 million buyback authorization increase occurred in 2021 and a $500 million increase was announced in July 2022. We expect buybacks will keep occurring, and did in 2021, but we think they will total under $100 million most years after $262 million in 2022 as the dividend, acquisitions, and EchoPark will be larger priorities. 2023 buybacks in the first half of the year were $90.7 million. As of mid-2023, $373.6 million of authorization remains and buybacks have reduced the diluted share count to 36.0 million from 65.8 million at the end of 2010.","Sonic Automotive is one of the largest auto dealership groups in the United States. The company has 108 franchised stores in 18 states, primarily in metropolitan areas in California, Texas, and the Southeast, plus 18 EchoPark and 7 Northwest Motorsports used-vehicle stores, and 16 collision centers. The company derives revenue from new and used vehicles plus parts and collision repair, finance, insurance, and wholesale auctions. Luxury and import dealerships make up about 83% of franchise new-vehicle revenue, while Honda, BMW, Mercedes, and Toyota constitute about 56% of new-vehicle revenue. BMW is the largest brand at about 26%. 2022's revenue was $14 billion, with EchoPark's portion totaling $2.5 billion. Sonic bought RFJ Auto in December 2021, which added $3.2 billion in sales.","Sonic's largest debt maturity at year-end 2022 through 2027 is $291.9 million in 2027, mostly from a mortgage line maturing that November. The credit facility matures in April 2025 and is undrawn at the end of 2022 with $292.9 million available for borrowing. Total liquidity at the end of June is about $864 million including $407 million of cash and floorplan deposits. Management has told us that the used floorplan line is like a revolver. Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA was about 2.01 times at June 30. Leverage in 2019 declined from about the 3.7 times level thanks to the early redemption of the firm's $289.3 million 5% notes due in May 2023.Sonic at year-end 2022 also had $302.6 million of mortgage notes with 62% of the balance at fixed rates ranging between 2.05% to 7.03% and maturities at various dates through 2033. The company owns about half its real estate, but has not disclosed how much unencumbered real estate it has. In October 2021, Sonic issued $1.15 billion of 2029 ($650 million at 4.625%) and 2031 notes ($500 million at 4.875%) to help fund the $950 million purchase of RFJ Auto Partners in December 2021, but we are not concerned about balance sheet health. We think the firm's debt profile is not going to be a challenge for management to maintain.",SAH,Consumer Cyclical,1811244160.0,NYQ,178639.0,USD,52.25,True,1,49.56211763269411,53.01864214296544,0
24/11/2023,Expect Kubota to Face Headwinds After Pandemic-Driven Tractor Boom Until First Half of 2024,Kubota Corp,6326,4,09/11/2023,Jason Kondo,2116.0,JPY,24/11/2023,2700.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,B,09/11/2023,"Despite Kubota's stronger-than-expected September-quarter revenue growth of 6% year on year, supported by the weak yen, our outlook is largely unchanged. We continue to expect the company's revenue to be affected by dealer inventory adjustments and weaker retail sales of tractors and construction machinery in the following quarters. Our revenue projection from fiscal 2024 is unchanged, as we assume revenue to remain flat (after growing 10% in 2023), assuming a top-line recovery from the second half of 2024. We maintain our revenue forecast of a 3.5% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2027 and leave our fair value estimate intact at JPY 2,700 per share. We believe the shares are undervalued as the market is overlooking Kubota's medium-term prospects, driven by further farming activity and infrastructure spending as well as higher spare-parts sales, supported by the influx of new machinery users during the pandemic. We've raised our 2023 revenue growth assumption to 10% from 7% after reflecting upon the strong results, but we expect sales to decline from the December quarter. According to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, September inventory levels of small tractors under 40 horsepower in the United States increased by 41% year on year, while monthly retail sales declined 7% from the previous year. Although the weak yen will mitigate some of the impact of sluggish demand, our 2023 projection assumes that December-quarter revenue will decline 5% year on year.","We expect stable long-term top-line growth as Kubota is the small tractor market leader in North America, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Construction equipment demand in the U.S. should be supported by infrastructure spending and a shortage of housing units. The acquisition of Escorts, the fourth-largest tractor manufacturer in India, provides growth opportunities in the worlds biggest market.","High dealer inventory of compact tractors overseas will lead to a near-term adjustment phase after the high COVID-induced demand. Record capital expenditures in 2022-23 and a negative regional mix from weaker North America sales will dent near-term margins. The water and environment business has lower growth prospects and margins compared with the machinery business, making it potentially value-destructive over the long term.",09/11/2023,"Kubota continues to strengthen its high-end compact farm and construction equipment offering for small agriculture and residential/lawn-mowing in its core markets. In its largest market by sales, North America, the company has established itself as the market leader and pioneer with subcompact tractors (under 40 horsepower) since forming its first overseas tractor distribution company in 1972. In Asia, the company utilizes its strength with rice farming machinery and has the leading tractor and crawler combine harvester shares in Japan and ASEAN regions. Further, on the construction side, the company has held the leading global share in mini-excavators for about two decades and has the second-highest share in compact track loaders in North America. We expect the company to utilize its developmental capability with small-size machinery, brand, and vast dealer network to capitalize on further demand. M&A has had a key role in Kubotas overseas expansion, especially over the past three years. The company acquired multiple European agricultural equipment companies to expand its mower/implement offerings. Further, in India, the company raised its stake in Escorts, the fourth-largest regional tractor player, making it a subsidiary. In addition to solidifying its footprint in the worlds largest tractor market, Kubota plans to leverage Escorts procurement network to incorporate low-cost parts into its products and turn India into a manufacturing hub for the exports of its basic tractor line. As for organic strategic investments, we expect Kubota to make high capital and research and development investments in the future. As part of its plan to increase overseas production from 35% to 50% over the medium term, the company transferred production of CTLs from Japan to the U.S., and is expanding capacity overseas. As for R&D, the company has been making progress with electrification/autonomous driving technologies and its Internet of Things platform, Kubota Smart Agri System. Kubota has started renting its electric tractors to select customers in Europe; further, it is partnering with Nvidia to develop next-generation self-driving tractors.","We think Kubota has carved out a wide moat based on its intangible assets and switching costs in the small and midsize agricultural and construction machinery (referred to as compact machinery) space. The companys farm and industrial machinery segment, which comprises 90% of operating income excluding eliminations, has an intangible assets moat source that rests heavily on its global dealer network and brand strength, supported by its long-term track record as well as continued refinement in technology. For new buyers of compact machinery, the key determinants of purchases are accessibility of after-market service and reputation for product reliability. For existing customers, the relationship with the dealer and familiarity/experience in both the operation and repair of a particular brands equipment become increasingly important. As a secondary moat source, we expect switching costs for dealers to mitigate the risk of switching suppliers, as they would not only bear additional costs/investments but also risk their quality of service as they go through a new learning curve with the products, maker-specific tooling, and maintenance.Compact Machinery Leader in North America, Japan, and ThailandThe machinery business moat is based on its strong positioning in North America, Japan, and Thailand, which constitute about 70% of segment sales. In these regions, Kubota is the market leader with compact tractors (up to 40 horsepower), mini-excavators, and diesel engines below 100 horsepower. In North America (where we project half of its machinery sales by 2027), unlike wide-moat Deere, which leads the overall tractor market, Kubota competes only in the compact and the utility submarkets (up to 40 horsepower and up to 250 horsepower respectively), where Kubota has the leading share at 35% in the former and second largest share at 25% after Deere in the latter. On the construction side, the company leads the North American mini-excavator market, while being second behind Bobcat in the compact track loader market, with regional shares in the low 20s for both. In Asia, the company has a strong positioning with rice farming equipment, namely tractors and combine harvesters, where the company has 40% domestic share and above 70% in Thailand. The respective shares have been stable over the long term, which we largely attribute to the companys early market entrance and intangible assets moat source, supported by its dealer network and brand/reputation.Established Dealer Network Provides a Solid Foundation for Kubotas MoatIncumbent players like Kubota possess advantages from established dealer networks, as a robust support structure gives the benefit of a better quality after-service for the end-users. Unlike with automobiles, the users of agriculture/construction machinery must form relationships with their dealers, due to the higher frequency of maintenance and after-services. The equipment is constantly exposed to rough conditions off-road, thus making them highly prone to mechanical wear and tear. As a result, knowing that even the most durable machines require parts replacement, the potential buyers look to minimize productivity loss by prioritizing access to spare parts, physical distance to the dealer, and the general quality of customer service by the dealers. Once the equipment is purchased, the end-users develop relationships with their local dealers throughout the term of the ownership/lease, which can range from 3 to 10 years, depending on the application, frequency of usage, and whether to resell. This, in turn, benefits the manufacturer like Kubota through sales of newer models, spare parts, and other products like tractor attachments called implements.The quality and scale of an established dealer network creates barriers to entry because existing dealers stick with their key suppliers and nonincumbent manufacturers face hurdles in expanding their dealer network. In North America, Kubota works with its network of 1,100 dealers, where 60% of which carry only its products. Many of these dealers have been owned/managed by the same family over many years and generations, where they are familiar with the products from having provided related services. This improves the dealers own quality of service and reputation in their community; therefore, dealers value maintaining long-term relationships with suppliers. Even in cases of dealers who sell competing brands, most develop a stronger loyalty for the first brand they have dealt with, due to the longer relationship and product familiarity. Moreover, nonincumbent manufacturers face hurdles in expanding their dealer network, as they must deal with the complexities of managing and/or reorganizing their spare parts inventory management as well as supply chain network, while maintaining the level of service with existing dealers. Currently, the network size of nonincumbent players, like India-based Mahindra and Korea-based Kioti, fall below 500 dealers each in the U.S., and we expect it will take a significant time to materially scale.Brand and Reputation From Compact Machinery Contribute to Intangible AssetsKubotas brand and reputation, or the perception users have toward its products/services and the credibility behind it is another contributor to its intangible assets moat source. As a result of the companys long-term record of supplying equipment in North America and Asia (Japan/Asean countries), its Kubota orange tractors are often recognized by users and are sold at a premium. The reliability of both agricultural and construction machinery are important, as users seek to maximize productivity through crop yields/construction progress and choose a tractor that can endure grueling conditions with limited damage to minimize cost of equipment ownership. Since most users cannot assess the quality of technology behind the product, they rely on factors like brand, reputation, and feedback/reviews by people when purchasing. Further, as incumbent players, like Kubota, have built their brand/reputation from supplying dependable equipment, they also have the advantage of higher resale value, which is also a key consideration when purchasing machinery. We think the companys reputation is rooted in its track record as the market pioneer with compact machinery. In the U.S. market, the company initially faced difficulties expanding, due to the established dealer network by incumbents at the time as well as lack of interest in compact diesel-powered tractors (when larger gasoline-powered tractors were prevalent). However, Kubota made a strategic shift to target homeowners with landscaping needs and eventually pioneered the market for small, diesel-powered tractors for lawn mowing. Since then, their applications expanded, such as smaller farms, vineyards, and orchards, which tend to have narrow spaces (for example, according to Kubota, two thirds of tractors used in Napa Valley are Kubota tractors). Other companies followed suit but we expect Kubotas brand reputation and continued refinement in its specialization will continue to have its products be often preferred by dealers and end-users.Switching Costs for Dealers Support Machinery Business as a Secondary Moat SourceAs a secondary moat source, we think the costs that arise from switching brands for dealers reinforce the strength of Kubotas intangible assets moat source. Dealers rarely cancel brands as switching suppliers would not only lead to incurring costs of relearning the product line but also create risks of damaging their reputation in the community they serve. They would have to undergo various training (such as on the products basic engineering, operation, and maintenance) by the manufacturers. Further, the loss in the quality of dealer service is unavoidable upon switching because the only way the dealers maintenance staff can provide a similar level of service prior to switching is through on-the-job experience of facing various customer issues. Therefore, the costs/risks that come from lack of experience with a new brand as well as the learning curve process provides incentives to stick with existing suppliers. Despite not being the primary moat source, we think switching costs are important for the manufacturers because it mitigates the risk of existing dealers to drop a brand, which would lead to losing sales opportunities in the surrounding area/community.Capital Expenditures and Inventory Increase to Affect ROIC but Expect Durable Economic Profits in its Established MarketsWe think the combination of its vast dealer network and brand/reputation as the compact machinery leader in North America, Japan, and Asean provides a strong case for a wide moat, rather than narrow. While the companys significant ramp up in capital expenditures as well as inventory since 2021 will affect ROIC for the foreseeable future, we think its midterm strategy to increase the proportion of overseas production in the U.S. and Thailand reaffirms its continued priority in these regions, where its intangible assets are stronger and higher margins are generated. While its operating margin is pulled down by lower margin product sales in Japan and Europe (sells facilities for rice milling only in the domestic market and larger tractors with higher cost-base in Europe), the companys margins in North America and Thailand are the highest for the company. In fact, while the farm equipment & engine segments operating margin has averaged about 12% in the last four years, we estimate its margins in North America/Thailand to be in the upper teens, which we note is similar to Deeres small ag and turf segments margins. We expect the companys investments will allow the company to fend off increasing competition over the long term. In established markets, we think many users will continue to pay a premium for performance and accessibility in service/spare parts. As farmers/contractors become increasingly sophisticated and look to increase productivity by utilizing technology, the compact machinery market leader will continue to invest in technologies to deal with secular trends, such as autonomous vehicles to deal with labor shortage/aging population in Japan as well as electrification trends globally. To this end, while we think the electrification trend will be a far slower transition compared with the automobile industry, Kubota has been investing in both battery and fuel cell agriculture technologies and also unveiled prototypes to its electric autonomous tractors and electric mini excavators, similar to other incumbent players, suggesting they will not fall behind competitors on the development. Further, with Kubotas acquisition of Indias fourth largest tractor market player, Escorts, we think Kubota would be able to provide lower cost products in the future in its key markets, and then promote upgrades to higher-end products.","We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating for Kubota. Demand for its compact farm/construction equipment is subject to fluctuations in U.S. residential construction activity, prices of Thai/Japanese rice and crops from small farms/orchards (less so for corn/soybeans, which tend to be from larger farms), as well as infrastructure spending. Despite this, since the global financial crisis, the company has only faced year on year revenue decline in 2016 and 2020, caused by a mix of strong Japanese yen/drought in Thailand and the initial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The subsequent stay-at-home trend led to significant sales growth and while Kubota will be affected by a postpandemic slowdown in demand, we expect the revenue volatility to settle down as end-demand recovers from the second half of 2024.We forecast above 70% of machinery sales to come from established markets, like North America, Japan, and Thailand. Further, we do not see any technological disruption that would materially affect Kubotas revenue. In fact, we think there will be a slower adoption of electric compact machinery compared with automobiles, given the hurdles like longevity, weight, and charging stations. Although the company has already developed electric compact tractors/excavators and rents its electric tractors to select customers in Europe, we do not expect this to be material over the next five years.We do not see any substantial threats related to ESG for Kubota. Similar to its competitors, the company is exposed to risks related to carbon emissions, quality control, and regulatory risks. Although we expect government initiatives to promote electrification/impose restrictions on diesel fuel will increasingly affect Kubota over the long term, we expect these changes to be gradual. Meanwhile, we expect Kubota to continue refining its battery/fuel cell technologies and work on its target to reduce carbon emissions from its machinery by 30% between 2020 and 2030.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Kubota is Standard. We think its recent increase in strategic investments through capital expenditures and M&A is in the right direction. However, we would like to see the investments yield improvements through higher regional share in the investment target regions, mainly India/Europe, and higher margins to be considered as having exemplary capital allocation. Nevertheless, we expect these initiatives will gradually improve operating efficiency. For example, as part of its significant ramp up in capital expenditures, the company aims to increase the proportion of overseas production from 30% to 50% to better meet local demand and mitigate supply chain risks. To this end, the company is making progress by transferring the production of its compact track loaders to the U.S., where much of the growth prospects is expected.We think M&A is the best approach for Kubota to increase share in regions with smaller market presence. The most notable inorganic investment was when the company raised its stake in India-based Escorts in 2022, making it a subsidiary. By expanding its presence in the worlds largest tractor market, the company became the fourth-largest local player. Further, the company plans to leverage Escorts procurement network to improve cost competitiveness and utilize the production facilities in India as a manufacturing hub for its basic tractor line. In Europe, the company has recently made multiple acquisitions of local agricultural equipment companies to expand its product line. Although the company will need to avoid the pitfalls of price competition, especially with the sales of its basic tractor line, we believe these investments will provide new sources of long-term growth.We think shareholder distributions are at standard levels, as its payout ratio has averaged about 30% over the past five years, and we expect a similar trend going forward. The company has also been doing share buybacks of about JPY 20 billion every year since 2019. We are pleased with its recent announcement to increase its interim dividend by JPY 2 from the previous year to JPY 24 and increase its buyback amount with an additional JPY 10 billion in the second half of 2023, after JPY 20 billion in the first half (in other words, totaling JPY 30 billion for the full year). We think this is a strong signal that the company is flexible on its capital allocation, depending on the situation.","Kubota manufactures and sells small and midsize agricultural and construction equipment as well as water treatment equipment. Its key products in the farm and industrial machinery segment include compact/utility tractors, mini excavators, compact track loaders, engines, and rice farming equipment, such as combine harvesters as well as rice transplanters. The company has produced over 5.4 million units of tractors worldwide and over 30 million units of engines. Its water and environment segment provides mainly pipe system products like ductile iron pipes and valves, water/waste treatment plants, pumps, as well as operation and maintenance services, including public-private partnership projects. The company is based in Osaka, Japan, and was founded in 1890.","We think Kubotas financial strength is sound, despite the record debt and investments in fiscal 2022. The interest-bearing liabilities that funds its captive finance business, which provides loans for tractor purchases in mainly North America and Thailand, makes up above 95% of total consolidated debt balance. As a result of the record tractor demand in those regions, the companys consolidated debt balance increased to JPY 16 billion in 2022, up from JPY 10 billion in 2021. Although this pushed up the net debt/EBITDA ratio to 2.6 in 2022, which is well above its 1.5 average between 2017 and 2021, this was also contributed by temporary factors like rising components and logistics costs in 2022. While we expect debt levels to remain high, we project the net debt/EBITDA to gradually revert to pre-COVID-19 levels by 2025, as cost pass-throughs take place and sales pick up after the current macroeconomic headwinds.Kubotas free cash flow turned negative in 2022 after being consistently positive since 2014. Other than the impact of rising costs, the companys working capital increased by 40% year on year to JPY 969 billion, due to a significant increase in inventory and receivables to meet strong demand. Further, the company made large strategic investments in 2022, by raising its stake of India-based Escorts (largest to date at about JPY 140 billion) as well as record capital expenditures at JPY 170 billion, or 6.3% of revenue, compared with an average of 4.5% between 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, we project free cash flow to turn positive in 2023, contributed by earnings before interest growth and limited change in the working capital.",6326.T,Industrials,2461898113024.0,JPX,2392400.0,JPY,2116.0,True,1,2177.987804878049,2172.4430379746836,1
24/11/2023,LyondellBasell's Performance Will Improve With Strengthening Global Economy Over Long Run,LyondellBasell Industries NV,LYB,4,31/10/2023,Katherine Olexa,94.96,USD,23/11/2023,118.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,31/10/2023,"LyondellBasell's third-quarter results reflected continued challenges arising from a sluggish global macroeconomic environment, with sales down 13% year over year. Favorable tailwinds contributed to year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion exceeding 370 basis points, though most of this is attributable to two one-off events during the quarter rather than a signal of improving market dynamics. We don't expect significant improvements through year-end either, though we remain optimistic that end markets will begin to recover around 2024 and beyond. We lower our fair value estimate to $118 per share from $124 and maintain our narrow moat rating. Shares remain slightly undervalued at the time of writing. The firm opened its new facility for manufacturing propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol, together denoted as PO/TBA, in Houston during the quarter. LyondellBasell's global PO/TBA production capacity expanded 35% to 4.4 million tons per year, in line with its North American polyethylene capacity of 4.1 million. The facility will significantly shift the firm's overall product mix moving forward, and we expect margins for the firm's intermediates and derivatives segment will average in the high teens moving forward. The segment's EBITDA margin jumped to 23% this quarter due to serendipitous timing of the PO/TBA plant's opening and unanticipated downtime from several assets across the U.S. Gulf Coast arising from unplanned maintenance requirements. We expect pricing and margins will normalize once that capacity comes back online.","LyondellBasell benefits from its cost-advantaged North American operations that use low-cost natural gas-based feedstock. By licensing its chemical and polyolefin process technologies, LyondellBasell can secure asset-light revenue streams that often lead to long-term supply agreements. LyondellBasell maintains exposure to a wide variety of industrial and consumer end markets, somewhat mitigating the risk of a potential industry-specific downturn.","Half of LyondellBasells operations are outside of North America and are subject to higher and more volatile costs, which will weigh on profits. LyondellBasells North American natural gas feedstock-based cost advantage will erode over time due to a permanent increase in North American natural gas prices. This will lead to margin compression over the long run. Tightening regulations concerning potentially hazardous chemicals could require investment in development of alternative products that may raise the firms operational costs over time.",31/10/2023,"LyondellBasell is one of the largest petrochemical producers in the world, manufacturing ethylene and propylene and myriad chemical derivatives, including propylene oxide, or PO. These products form the building blocks for downstream chemicals and plastics that are used in industrial and consumer markets alike. About 70% of LyondellBasells ethylene and polyethylene production capacity sits in North America. Its total ethylene and propylene capacity is fairly evenly split between North American and international markets.  The firms exposure to North America allows it to benefit from low-cost natural gas-based feedstocks. This allows LyondellBasell to manufacture at a significant cost advantage to marginal cost producers that rely on higher-cost crude oil-based feedstocks to make the same products. Lyondells commodity chemicals are generally priced off of the marginal cost of production. Low natural gas prices and high oil prices have led to substantial profits for firms operating in North America, and we expect this dynamic will persist. Although LyondellBasell may not enjoy the same low-cost raw feedstocks in its international operations, the company builds its plants to allow different feedstocks to reduce input costs. Half of its European assets can utilize several different feedstocks in production, allowing LyondellBasell some flexibility against input price volatility. LyondellBasell is one of the largest PO producers worldwide, a chemical derivative used in a range of products, including insulation and furniture cushioning. LyondellBasell employs a PO production process that yields tertiary butyl alcohol, or TBA, as a coproduct which is eventually used as an input for high-octane gasoline. PO/TBA production sits on the lowest end of the PO production cost curve, and only about 15% of global production capacity can utilize the process. In the first quarter of 2023, LyondellBasell opened a new production facility that nearly doubled its PO/TBA production capacity in North America. Once fully operational, we expect the site will augment LyondellBasells existing cost advantage by utilizing low-cost feedstocks in fairly unique production process.  ","We award LyondellBasel a narrow moat based on a cost advantage, mostly driven by its olefins and polyolefins, or O&P, segment in North America. O&P represents about 61% of the overall business, with operations in North America as well as Europe, Asia, and international, or EAI, markets. Within O&P, LyondellBasell manufactures ethylene and propylene, key building blocks for countless chemicals and plastics with broad sweeping applicationsautomotive components, insulation products, and antifreeze, to name a few. The majority of the ethylene and propylene LyondellBasell produces is consumed internally as inputs for its remaining business lines, expanding the reach of its North American cost advantage throughout the rest of the firm. Over 70% of the firms ethylene and polyethylene production capacity sits in North America. Ethylene (and propylene) itself is produced by steam cracking natural gas- or crude oil-based feedstock (ethane from natural gas, or naphtha from crude oil). Analysis by the American Chemistry Council indicates European and Asian producers rely on oil-based naphtha for roughly two thirds of their operations. By contrast, about 90% of North American production relies on natural gas. This geographical dichotomy has created a comparative cost advantage for North American producers thats persisted for more than a decade. Oil products are traded on the world market, meaning all producers encounter the same price worldwide. Natural gas, on the other hand, is priced regionally. As it pertains to global ethylene production, only North American producers benefit from low-cost North American gas prices, and ethane has served as a significantly cheaper raw material than naphtha over the last several years. The U.S. has held a comparative cost advantage since the mid-2000s, indicated by the oil/gas ratio (calculated as the spot price for Brent crude oil divided by the spot price for Henry Hub natural gas). According to the EIA, a ratio above 7 implies a comparative advantage to the U.S., while a ratio below 6 implies the opposite. The average oil/gas ratio has exceeded 7 since 2006, averaging 21 times over that period. LyondellBasells North American operations thus fall on the very low end of the ethylene cost curve, allowing it to produce chemical derivatives more cheaply than international competitors. Higher production margins in North America are supported on both the cost side and on the pricing side. Market prices for ethylene and propylene are set by European and Asian producers, meaning they incorporate the higher costs associated with naphtha-derived ethylene production. Given our outlook for the oil/gas ratio to be 18 times based on our midcycle forecasts, LyondellBasells cost advantage should remain in place for at least the next decade.The O&P-EAI segment relies much more heavily on naphtha in its operations, so it does not enjoy the same cost advantage exhibited by its North American counterpartits 2021 operating margin was 13% compared with 35% for O&P Americas. This segment has a neutral impact on LyondellBasells overall competitive advantage, in our view. Less than one third of the firms ethylene and polyethylene production capacity is attributed to O&P-EAI, implying that the majority of inputs used throughout the business are sourced from North America. Furthermore, management indicates roughly half of its European assets can substitute feedstocks, which can help LyondellBasell maximize its profitability as input costs and product prices fluctuate over time. The ethylene and propylene manufactured by both O&P segments support operations of the firms intermediates and derivatives, or I&D, segment. I&D represented 22% of total revenue in 2021, and it uses ethylene and propylene to manufacture propylene oxide and intermediate chemicals (such as styrene monomer) that serve as inputs for plastics, insulation products, and engineering resins, among countless other consumer and industrial applications. Utilizing internally sourced ethylene and propylene reduces the segments raw materials costs compared with competitors. The I&D segment also uses two distinct methods that set its propylene oxide processes at the low end of the production cost curve, and each method yields co-products with myriad downstream applications. One method yields tertiary butyl alcohol, or TBA, as the coproduct, while the other yields styrene monomer, or SM. Approximately 50% of global propylene oxide production capacity can utilize PO/TBA and PO/SM manufacturing methods (15% and 35%, respectively). The other half of the industry relies on chlorohydrin and non-coproduct processes, which are much more expensive. By exclusively using PO/TBA and PO/SM methods, LyondellBasell can further reduce the cost base of its byproducts. The refining segment is the least cohesive with LyondellBasells other businesses. It primarily focuses on products refined from heavy, high-sulfur crude oil (gasoline, distillates, and so on). LyondellBasell will cease segment operations by the end of 2023. The segment hasnt been profitable since 2016, and management estimates an investment surmounting $1 billion (and very likely more) will be required to maintain operational efficiency. Citing insufficient returns on capital, the firm is instead opting to shutter operations. In our view, a sale is unlikely given the recent dearth of willing buyers. Furthermore, management has expressed a desire to repurpose these high-quality assets for other projects such as its burgeoning circularity solutions business (featuring recycled plastic manufacturing and renewable feedstock development). If LyondellBasell indeed pursues this conversion, we expect it could present a profitable business opportunity but wont necessarily be moat-enhancing. Circular solutions will likely experience accelerating demand over the next several years as firms around the world seek to mitigate their environmental impact (further spurred by tightening regulations). However, these solutions can be cost-intensive, and several competitors are pursuing similar ventures. The refining segment represented 17% of LyondellBasells 2021 revenue and, assuming the firm keeps the associated plant assets, its returns on invested capital will likely drop in the years following closure (though we expect it will still generate returns in excess of its cost of capital). The firm is still exploring options, however, and management has plenty of time to make a final decision. ","LyondellBasell earns a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. Oil and gas prices are key determinants of the firms overall cost basis. Given the inherent volatility present in these markets, LyondellBasells input costs and the price it receives for its commodity chemicals can be quite variable over time. We look to the oil/gas price ratio as a directional indicator of profits as well as the fractionation spread. Generally, wed expect lower oil prices, higher natural gas prices, and wider fractionation spreads to compress firmwide profit margins.LyondellBasell is subject to a range of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, issues that could pose challenges moving forward. The firms heavy reliance on fossil fuels as feedstocks exposes the firm to the inherently volatile oil and gas market. Increasingly stringent regulations on energy efficiency and emissions management could increase operational costs over time. The firm is also exposed to similar risks from its emissions (air pollutants, wastewater, and so on) that may lead to costly facilities upgrades. Failure to comply could lead to operational restrictions or fines that weigh on profits.The nature of LyondellBasells products pose ESG risks in and of themselves. The firm manufactures a plethora of chemical compounds, many of which are known to pose hazards to human health and the environment. Improper management of its products and services could leave the firm liable for associated damages in the event of an incident which, could involve hefty fines and lawsuits. The firm also risks facing an outright ban on certain products or chemicals, forcing reformulations that could require considerable R&D investments as well as capital expenditures to retrofit plants. However, the companys peers also face these same risks and forced reformulations could also pose a business opportunity as demand for cleaner and safer alternatives strengthens over time.","We rate LyondellBasell with a Standard capital allocation rating based on our framework that analyzes balance sheet health, investment strategy and shareholder distributions. LyondellBasell maintains a sound balance sheet. At the last reporting period, LyondellBasell had $2.8 billion of cash on hand and $11.1 billion of debt (roughly 25% of which will mature by 2026). Net debt/EBITDA was 1.4 at the end of 2022. With no major acquisitions planned, we expect the firm will maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.The firms investment strategy is fair. We are in favor of LyondellBasells new propylene oxide/tertiary butyl alcohol production facility in Houston, Texas, which opened in the first quarter of 2023. The PO/TBA process sits on the lowest end of the PO production cost curve, and only 15% of global PO production features PO/TBA. Once fully operational, this facility will nearly double LyondellBasells PO/TBA production capacity in North America. We expect the project will augment LyondellBasells cost advantage given its favorable location and low-cost production capabilities. Since commencing construction in late 2018, roughly half of LyondellBasells annual capital expenditures have been allocated to the project, but we expect the firm will see an adequate return on investment over the next few years. However, we dont view all of managements investments as a strong value add. LyondellBasell recently announced the closure of its refining business by the end of 2023, citing returns on invested capital too insufficient to justify continuing operations. Management indicates its Houston refinery requires investments exceeding $1 billion to remain in operation. Given the business mediocre track record (the refining segment barely breaks even each year), LyondellBasell is opting to cease operations altogether. At present, management doesnt seem keen on selling the legacy assets and is exploring avenues for repurpose. Though management has not announced a formal plan for the facilities, the company has hinted that the site could be a good fit for the firms burgeoning recycling businesses. Assuming that occurs, wed expect an overall neutral impact on the firms overall value proposition. On the one hand, we expect demand for recycled plastics will strengthen over the next several years driven by evolving regulations and consumer preferences. LyondellBasell is already dedicating ample resources to developing its recycling capabilities and retrofitting legacy assets could provide some cost synergies. On the other hand, we dont expect the initiative will materially strengthen LyondellBasells competitive positioning. Its circularity solutions demand considerable upfront investment and most of the firms competitors are pursuing similar technological developments. We rate shareholder distributions as appropriate. LyondellBasell consistently returns significant cash back to shareholders, which makes sense given the firm operates in a mature industry. The company has increased its annual dividend payment for the last 11 years straight, averaging about 12.5% growth per year since 2012. Management paid a special dividend in the second quarter of 2022, implying a total dividend payout ratio of 66% for the year. Though we dont expect additional special dividends moving forward, management prioritizes dividend growth as a part of its capital allocation strategy. The firm also resumed its share repurchase program in late 2021 (after pausing it to conserve capital during the pandemic), returning an additional $460 million to shareholders. Prior to COVID-19, annual repurchases averaged $3 billion per year. Year to date, repurchases total $70 million, and while future buybacks are likely in our view, we expect management will use dividend payments as its central vehicle for shareholder distributions.","LyondellBasell is a petrochemical producer with operations in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The company is the worlds largest producer of polypropylene and is also a major producer of polyethylene and propylene oxide. Its chemicals are used in various consumer and industrial end products. Well over half of LyondellBasells production come from its North American operations.","LyondellBasell is in solid financial health. At the last reporting period, the firm had $2.8 billion of cash on hand and $11.1 billion of debt, nearly two thirds of which does not mature until 2030 and beyond. Net debt/EBITDA was a manageable at 1.4 times (at the end of 2022), and we expect it will remain healthy over time as the firm should generate enough cash from operations to cover its capital expenditures. We expect the company will continue to generate positive free cash flow, which should be sufficient to grow its dividend going forward.",LYB,Basic Materials,30976569344.0,NYQ,1576728.0,USD,94.95999908447266,True,1,95.56494095745765,96.16703721034692,0
24/11/2023,Ingredions Specialty Ingredients Position Company for Steady Long-Term Profit Growth,Ingredion Inc,INGR,4,07/11/2023,Seth Goldstein,104.25,USD,23/11/2023,120.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,07/11/2023,"Ingredion's third-quarter earnings were in line with our view for the cadence of the year. While volumes declined 8% versus the prior-year quarter, price increases over cost inflation drove a 15% growth in adjusted operating income. Volume declines were lower than in the second quarter, and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter as customer inventory destocking largely winds down. Having updated our model to incorporate Ingredion's third-quarter earnings, we maintain our $120 per share fair value estimate. Our narrow-moat rating is also unchanged. Ingredion shares were up nearly 6% at the time of writing as the market reacted favorably to the profit growth and management's guidance increase for 2023 profits. At current prices, we view Ingredion shares as undervalued with the stock trading in 4-star territory and a little over 15% below our fair value estimate. In the coming years, we expect Ingredion's gradual shift toward its specialty ingredients will generate steady long-term profit growth. For income-focused investors, the company offers a current dividend yield of a little over 3%, with a dividend that is likely to grow over time. In 2024, with lower corn prices, we expect Ingredion will likely see companywide prices fall, as corn makes up around 80% of the company's input costs. Given the company's cost-plus nature of many of its commodity ingredient sales, we expect Ingredion will be able to generate profit growth as its contracts reset at a sales level but allow the company to maintain its profits. In specialty ingredients, Ingredion reported 6% higher sales throughout the first three quarters of 2023 versus 2022. As the company completes an expansion of its Stevia natural sweeteners capacity, we expect another year of solid specialties growth in 2024, supporting profit growth for the year.","Ingredion benefits from its growing proportion of specialty ingredients that carry some degree of pricing power and generate higher profit margins. Through its investment in plant-based proteins and natural non-corn-based sweeteners, Ingredion is well positioned to capture growth from increasing consumer demand for alternative meat and reduced sugar products. Management has a strong record of managing growth and acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders. ","High-fructose corn syrup (roughly 10% of sales) has been linked with obesity and diabetes and is in declining use as a beverage sweetener. Outside the U.S., Ingredions profitability is subject to fluctuating input prices for corn and other starch raw materials. While consumer demand for plant protein products will grow, plant protein ingredients are commodities that offer lower profit margins than specialty ingredients, which will weigh on companywide profit margins.",07/11/2023,"Ingredion manufactures starches and sweeteners by wet milling and processing corn and other starch-based raw materials. The company steeps these raw materials in a water-based solution before separating the ingredients from co-products (animal feed and corn oil). Starches are the largest category, generating around 45% of revenue, followed by sweeteners at roughly 35%, and co-products at 20%. The starches are then further processed into starch and sweetener ingredients used primarily by the food and beverage industries. The company classifies its products as either core or specialty ingredients. By our estimation, in 2022, specialty ingredients generated 34% of companywide sales and 51% of profits. The company's long-term goal is for specialty ingredients to generate 38% of sales and nearly 60% of profits. Core ingredients are typically commodity-grade, providing no pricing power for Ingredion. Ingredion sells roughly half of its core products on a cost-plus basis. Specialty ingredients are value-added, requiring additional processing and, in many cases, proprietary formulations. They typically command at least twice the gross margins and double the price of core ingredients. Although we expect demand for Ingredions core ingredients to grow at a low-single-digit rate, specialty ingredients volumes should grow in the mid- to high single digits. Ingredion has been investing heavily in specialty ingredients. These include starch-based texturizers, plant-based proteins used in alternative meat products, and specialty sweeteners such as stevia and allulose. Ingredion has a multinational footprint, reporting via four geographic segments. North America (62% of 2022 sales); South America (14%); Asia-Pacific (14%); and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (10%). Raw materials account for roughly half of the companys unit costs. Corn, which is purchased around the world at market prices, represents the companys single largest expense at roughly 80% of raw materials. Ingredion actively hedges against corn price fluctuations in North America, matching hedge volumes with its corn-based ingredient volumes, which helps stabilize gross margins amid changes in corn prices.","We assign a narrow moat rating to Ingredion. The most appropriate lens through which to analyze the companys competitive advantage is our moat framework for commodity processors. Moaty businesses that operate in this space tend to benefit from switching costs, intangible assets, or cost advantage. For Ingredion, we see evidence of switching costs and intangible assets, but not cost advantage. Slightly more than 70% of companywide sales involve the processing of raw materials (corn, tapioca, potatoes, rice) purchased at market prices into commodity-grade starch and sweetener ingredients over which Ingredion commands no pricing power. We view this core ingredients business as no-moat, however, with roughly half of the core ingredients sales priced on a cost-plus basis, it should generally deliver returns on invested capital in line with the companys weighted average cost of capital. However, we contend that Ingredions specialty ingredients business operates with a narrow moat and earns excess ROICs. As a result, it has served as the key driver of the positive economic profit spread witnessed on a companywide basis each year over the past decade.The evidence for both switching costs and intangible assets stems predominantly from Ingredions specialty ingredients business, which accounts for nearly one third of companywide sales and the majority of profits. These solutions include an array of proprietary offerings that align with growing market and consumer trends. Switching costs stem from the fact that, when these proprietary formulations are used by consumer packaged goods customers for food and beverages, buyers are often unwilling to jeopardize the brand equity of their products by switching to alternative solutions that consumers might reject. Often, specialty solutions are formulated with specific customer needs in mind, as Ingredion partners with its customers to develop new formulations and applications for their products. With the consumables space subject to a high degree of regulatory oversight, we see traces of switching costs for even the companys commodity-grade ingredients. Customers are often hesitant to switch away from suppliers like Ingredion that have established a lengthy record of quality and reliability with regard to food safety compliance.Intangible assets stem from the research and development spending required for these specialty ingredients, which establishes intellectual property that protects them from replication. The company has more than 850 product-related patents and patents pending, in addition to a number of established trademarks. Although no individual patent or trademark is material to its business, we believe they are valuable in aggregate as they make the companys offerings more difficult to replicate. Ingredion expects that demand for its specialty ingredients will continue to grow more than twice the rate of its commodity ingredients. Specialty margins are also more than twice as high as commodity margins, as Ingredion commands more favorable pricing power for its specialty products. Accordingly, the proportion of companywide sales from specialty ingredients has been rising slowly but steadily, reaching 34% in 2022 from only 21% in 2013.For wide-moat flavor and fragrance companies, R&D spending as a percentage of sales typically exceeds 8%. For Ingredions specialty ingredients business, R&D accounts for 3% of specialty ingredients sales, indicating that, although intangible assets are present, they are not as strong as those of moatier operators. For Ingredions commodity-grade operations, the wet milling process by which raw materials are processed into starches and sweeteners provides few inroads for differentiation, preventing the company from establishing a cost advantage over peers. Although commodity ingredient processing has historically served as the companys core function, this will continue to change over the foreseeable future as the company makes incremental investments in growing its specialty volumes (both organically and via acquisition).Admittedly, given the scale of Ingredions commodity operations, the qualitative evidence for a companywide moat is arguable. However, the quantitative evidence is strong. Ingredions ROICs have consistently exceeded the companys weighted average cost of capital in recent years. Based on our calculations, ROICs have averaged 11% over the trailing 10-year period, safely above our assumed 8.3% WACC. Due primarily to an improving product mix driving very modest margin expansion, our midcycle ROIC forecast sits around 12.5%. We feel confident that economic profits will persist at least 10 years into the future. Although corn prices, Ingredions key input cost, can fluctuate significantly, half of Ingredions core sales are priced on a cost-plus basis, which essentially locks in returns roughly in line with the companys cost of capital. For the remaining half of core sales, the company's active hedging strategy should help minimize ROIC volatility in the years to come. As evidence of the stability of its business, Ingredion generated positive economic profits during both the financial crisis and the North American corn drought of 2012.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Ingredion.Volatile corn prices are a risk, as Ingredions hedging efforts are focused largely on its North American corn purchases. A significant drought in North America could prove problematic. Although corn could be sourced abroad, the associated incremental transportation costs could weigh on profitability if Ingredion was unable to pass along the higher costs. Ingredion's profits can also be affected by the spread between corn meal and soymeal prices as the two can be used interchangeably in many products such as animal nutrition.Geopolitical instability presents risks, given Ingredions market leadership in Pakistan as well as its exposure to Korea and various South American economies. Although its significant exposure to developing economies should more often than not drive attractive volume growth, growth in these regions can fluctuate meaningfully from year to year.Changing consumer preferences present both risk and opportunity. If Ingredion's portfolio does not adapt to consumer demands, such as the avoidance of high-fructose corn syrup, sales could decline. However, if the company aligns its portfolio with consumer demand, the company could gain market share on peers.Ingredion also faces potential environmental, social, and governance risks. The biggest risk we see is freshwater use, where future water limitations at some facilities would result in lower production. We view this as an industrywide risk to food, beverage, and ingredient producers. If this were to occur for Ingredion's customers, Ingredion's sales would likely be affected as well. We see a moderate probability and moderate impact to Ingredion should this occur.Another ESG risk is potential emissions regulations resulting in higher costs. However, we think this would equally affect Ingredion and its peers, resulting in costs being passed along to customers. We see a moderate probability for this to occur but a small impact to Ingredion.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Ingredion based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We rate the balance sheet as sound. Ingredion's revenue is subject to low cyclicality, but the company has medium operating leverage, resulting in medium unleveraged business risk. However, with a healthy balance sheet and few near-term debt maturities over the next few years, Ingredion should be able to meet its financial obligations.We view management's investments as fair. The company has exhibited prudent capital allocation practices and wise decisions regarding M&A, avoiding value destruction and favoring strong value creation. Management has pursued a tuck-in acquisition strategy to gain exposure to new types of specialty ingredients and diversify its portfolio away from corn-based products. The Kerr acquisition in 2015 gave Ingredion exposure to natural fruit and vegetable ingredients, while the TIC Gums acquisition in 2016 provided organic gum and texture ingredients. The Western Polymer acquisition in 2019 expands the company's starch portfolio. Ingredion's 2019 investment in Clara Foods adds a sustainable protein product made from yeast found naturally in eggs. The acquisition of PureCircle adds increased stevia production, which should have a favorable growth rate and expand the natural sweeteners portfolio. The Verdient deal should boost the company's plant-based protein growth. We are also in favor of management's organic investments, which include building a facility to produce the natural sweetener allulose and building another pea protein facility, both of which should position Ingredion to capture growth from changing consumer preferences.While we are in favor of management's growth strategy, the bulk of the company's portfolio remains commoditized corn-based sweeteners and starches. Commodity corn-based sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup, face declining demand, particulary in North America, which is Ingredion's largest market. In response to declining demand, management closed a production facility and has converted other facilities to produce more starches. However, we would prefer the company accelerate its portfolio transition and make a more proactive move to reduce HFCS as a percentage of total sales.We see shareholder distributions as appropriate. The company targets a dividend payout ratio of 25%-30% and should have no problem maintaining this level, which we view as maintainable.In 2010, Corn Products International acquired competitor National Starch and formed Ingredion. Jim Zallie took over as CEO of Ingredion in 2018, bringing 30-plus years of industry experience. Zallie was president and CEO of National Starch when it was acquired by Corn Products to form Ingredion. We expect Zallie to focus on executing the company's broader strategy, which includes a shift toward specialty ingredients and continued international expansion.Annual incentive plan awards for executives are determined by goals relating to EBITDA, operating working capital, and specialty ingredients growth. Long-term incentives are based on return on invested capital and total shareholder return. We appreciate that Ingredion cites ROIC as a key performance metric rather than absolute sales or profit targets, as this target should encourage management to make prudent investments in the growth of the company's specialty ingredients business, which forms the basis of our narrow moat rating.","Ingredion manufactures ingredients for the food and beverage industries, which make up around 70% of sales. The remaining sales come from the paper, personal-care, and animal nutrition industries. Value-added, specialty ingredients account for a little over one third of sales, with the balance being commodity-grade ingredients. With the majority of sales outside the U.S., Ingredion is a global player with good exposure to developing markets, including Latin America and Asia-Pacific.","Ingredion is in good financial condition. As of Sept. 30, the company had around $2.4 billion of debt and $335 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. We calculate net debt/adjusted EBITDA was around 1.8 times, below the companys long-term objective of 2.25. Ingredion's pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities are modest and should require no major cash outflows in the coming years. We forecast that Ingredion will continue to generate healthy free cash flow, which it has delivered consistently over the past decade, even during a cyclical trough. Assuming no major acquisitions are made, we expect Ingredion will maintain its strong financial position and easily be able to meet all financial obligations, including dividends.With regards to mergers and acquisitions, Ingredion will probably continue to target smaller, tuck-in acquisitions rather than pursuing large, transformative deals. These acquisitions would likely focus on companies that offer new product lines and cater to small and midsize customers, as Ingredion aims to both expand its specialty ingredient portfolio and avoid being beholden to the strong bargaining power of large consumer packaged goods customers. The company should be able to finance these size acquisitions largely from free cash flow, which should allow Ingredion to maintain its solid financial position.",INGR,Consumer Defensive,6817179648.0,NYQ,327371.0,USD,104.25,True,1,99.55717647776824,110.36740752797533,1
25/11/2023,DocuSign Is Taking E-Signatures to the Next Level,DocuSign Inc,DOCU,4,08/09/2023,Dan Romanoff,42.74,USD,24/11/2023,74.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,C,08/09/2023,"Narrow-moat DocuSign reported solid second-quarter results, with both top-line and non-GAAP operating margin exceeding our expectations. Operating margin remains strong as a result of recent headcount reductions. Margins are expected to decline throughout the remainder of the year though, as DocuSign continues to innovate and invest in its products such as ID Verification and the expanded availability of DocuSign Monitor. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, good results and a raised full-year outlook indicate that DocuSign is confident enough in its core business to invest in its products even in a difficult operating environment. DocuSign has executed well by focusing on margins, streamlining its sales approach, and accelerating product innovation. We keep our fair value estimate of $74. We see shares as attractive for patient investors, but continue to prefer some of our wide-moat names as macroeconomic uncertainty persists. Total revenue grew 11% year over year to $688 million, exceeding the high end of guidance at $679 million. Subscription revenue grew 11% year over year to $669 million, while services grew 8%. Within the international segment, expansion remains the primary goal and DocuSign has demonstrated the ability to execute, as it grew 17% year over year, representing 26% of total revenue. Billings were $711 million, up 10% year over year based on a higher rate of time renewals. Net dollar retention declined sequentially, consistent with recent trends, to 102%, and management expects that figure to trend further down in the third quarter. As a reminder, DocuSigns normal range is 112% to 119%, but the downtick was not unexpected as buying patterns are more modest, expansion remains constrained, and slight churn occurs amid the difficult macroenvironment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.7%, up significantly from 18.0% a year ago, and was driven by recent headcount reductions when compared with the previous year.","DocuSign is the market leader in e-signatures and is expanding to a broader contract life cycle management solution. The free trial, easier implementation, and rapid return on investment for DocuSign customers make for a compelling sales pitch. The company is also enjoying success moving upstream to larger customers. DocuSigns market consists of considerably more greenfield space than is typical within software.","Given its May 2018 IPO, DocuSign has limited operating history. While the company reported positive non-GAAP profitability for the first time in fiscal 2019, the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis. E-signatures may ultimately be a feature rather than a full-fledged solution suite. As the company moves upstream to increasingly larger clients, it is likely to face intensifying competition, particularly from Adobe.",09/06/2023,"As the leader in electronic signatures and contract life cycle management software, we think DocuSign has a long runway for growth through viral adoption in greenfield opportunities. We also see existing customers adopting more use cases and expanding seats over time, and also moving to the Agreement Cloud platform. DocuSigns vision is to modernize the contracting process by taking it from a disjointed and paper-based manual sequence of steps to an automated digital and collaborative system. We think the company has mastered the sign step of the process and has used it to build the Agreement Cloud around, but theres more to DocuSign than just e-signatures. The Agreement Cloud is a platform that includes tools to help users prepare contracts using intuitive drag and drop forms, negotiate, e-sign using a variety of enhanced security and identification means, automate agreement workflows for satisfying contract elements post-execution, allow for payment collections, and centralize account management. As use cases expand, we still expect the current primary driver of growth, the e-signature solution, to continue to grow rapidly thanks to the companys entrenched leadership position and the more unpenetrated market. Underlying the larger picture is that the company still offers free trials and self-service for pain-free test drives. We already see strong adoption in the more than one million paid customers, with 88% involving a sales rep, and hundreds of customers already driving annual contract value in excess of $300,000 annually. In the meantime, net dollar retention rates were strong but have declined as the COVID-19 lockdowns ended. Based on a bottom-up analysis, management estimates that DocuSign has a total addressable market of $50 billion, half of which is e-signatures alone, while Agreement Cloud is the next largest piece, with other services making up a smaller opportunity. However, while we think the immediate market is smaller, the relative underpenetration, as evidenced by rapid growth from both DocuSign and its largest competitor, Adobe, makes this less relevant.","We assign a narrow moat rating to DocuSign as a result of high customer switching costs, which we believe have enabled the firm to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital. We believe such excess returns are more likely than not to continue for the next 10 years.DocuSign provides a workflow platform referred to as the Agreement Cloud, which essentially helps users collaborate on the preparation, execution, and management of a contract. The software is cloud based and comes in tiered offerings ranging from $10 per user per month for the personal tier, $25 per user per month for standard, and $40 per user per month for business pro. DocuSign also has three specific vertical solutions for the real estate market that start at $10 per user per month. The company also offers some specialized additional features at an incremental cost that we think would mainly pertain to business pro users. Lastly, there is a usage cap on the number of signatures, called envelopes, but additional envelope provisioning can be purchased. At present we see primary use cases as financial services, real estate, health care, life sciences, legal and compliance, and government (with government being an upcoming but significant opportunity). That said, contracting still takes place overwhelmingly on paper-based forms, so even basic sales contracts from any vertical could potentially be modernized. While there ultimately is a paying customer involved in a DocuSign transaction, all parties need not be paying customers. The company offers a free mobile app for signers to sign for free from anywhere or they can sign from any computer for free as well. To that end, the company has more than half a million paid users, with hundreds of millions of total users. One of DocuSigns key selling points is simplicity. The app itself is simple install and use for a free user, but for the paid user the Agreement Cloud can easily be integrated with core systems and popular applications--more than 350 integrations are pre-built. The company also offers customers an API that is used by small and large customers alike.Our position is that switching costs for software are often driven by several factors. The most obvious is the direct time and expense of implementing a new software package for the customer while maintaining the existing platform. A major implementation is likely to involve a system integrator and can take several years. Additionally, there are indirect costs along those same lines, mainly lost productivity as customers move up a learning curve on the new system along with the distraction of users involved in the function where the change is occurring. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is the operational risk, including loss of data during the changeover, project execution, and potential operational disruption. The more critical the function and the more touch points across an organization a software vendor has, the higher the switching costs.In DocuSigns case, we view the software as a noncore application that improves operational efficiency and reduces costs. To that end, we think companies are looking for modernization in their contracting process. Customers can absolutely forgo the adoption of DocuSign (or Adobe Sign for that matter). By doing so, they would remain in the dark ages of contracting. The efficiencies gained and cost savings earned are meaningful. According to management, each signature on the companys platform saves $5 to $100 (average of $36) for the user, relative to the time, effort, and shipping or other costs needed to obtain signatures under a paper model. Further, 50% of transactions on the platform are completed in less than 15 minutes, with 83% completed in one day, compared with a nine-day turnaround for a paper-based signature. We can see a use case for DocuSign in so many instances, but in obvious applications, we think the savings and efficiencies gained would be significant. Purchasing a home floats to the top of that list, where a typical contract requires more than 100 signatures from all parties. For $120 annually, plus more modest usage fees, we think a typical real estate agent would be able to save tens of thousands of dollars and free up weeks of time over the course of a year. Like many applications that serve a market that includes both sole proprietors and the biggest multinational companies, the implementation ranges from nearly instant to monthslong rollouts. The more people and systems an application touches, the more complicated the implementation. We note that customer size is increasing as the company increasingly focuses on commercial and enterprise accounts. Net dollar retention has been quite strong at 117%, even including the small- and midsize-business clientele. DocuSign employs both a low-touch, self-service internet model, alongside a direct salesforce for larger customers. Penetration within large organizations tends to be viral. A small team in a local office may try the software and find it meets their needs; then the larger group may follow; then a second group may add a use case. Eventually, the application may find its way to corporate headquarters, where the software is formally adopted by the entire organization for a use case--and once again it spreads from there. Throughout a slow rolling adoption with an application that must be integrated into a larger software stack, system integrators may be required (mainly for CLM), and the implementation is likely to be phased over a period of months. E-signatures seem like an obvious idea. The U.S. government passed the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to define and allow for electronic signatures. E-signatures, therefore, have been used since but have really taken off in the last 10 years. Companies began using internal electronic signatures that were initially just clunky solutions bolted onto enterprise resource planning systems. They lacked one of the critical tenets of e-signatures that would have made them usable with external parties--a searchable record for authentication documents to which all signatories had access. DocuSign has obviously overcome that notion. We also think the passage of time has played a critical role here, in that people are simply more comfortable signing legal documents electronically today compared with 15 years ago.DocuSign believes the market for e-signatures is $25 billion, which it derives from a bottom-up analysis involving the number of potential businesses, use cases, and users. We think there is merit to these estimates as a longer-term view. However, most industry analysis seems to suggest the market is $5 billion to $10 billion--still quite large. Chief competitor Adobe, for example, believes e-signatures are the key features in a $6 billion opportunity (beyond the $7 billion market for Acrobat). This market has quickly evolved into a two-horse race between DocuSign and Adobe. DocuSigns revenue is approximately 80% of Adobes Document Cloud and has been gaining rapidly on a comparative basis. That said, Adobes segment revenue has accelerated meaningfully in the last several years, which we think has been driven by Adobe Sign. Further, Adobes document cloud skews more toward broader Acrobat-related revenue. We think DocuSign is larger in terms of pure e-signature revenue and is therefore the clear market leader. Either way, there are not many software companies with approximately $1 billion in revenue that are growing at 25%, which we think reflects the greenfield nature of this market.","We assign DocuSign a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The company generally trades at high multiples relative to peers, which offers less room for missteps and greater inherent risks in our view.While we see the e-signature market as greenfield, we think there is a longer-term risk that this becomes a feature integrated into workflow management solutions.DocuSign serves customers of all sizes, including the SMB segment. As with other companies under our coverage that have self-service models and include SMB in their customer base, customer churn is likely elevated. This is further exacerbated by the availability of monthly consumption plans. Management does not disclose churn statistics, but does disclose net dollar retention, which has been in the 113%-117% range for some time.DocuSign is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, nor do we expect the company to reach break-even for several years.DocuSign faces strong competition from Adobe, as well as a variety of considerably smaller privately held companies. We think the market for e-signature applications is largely a greenfield opportunity, so we think stronger competition is less likely within the medium term, as DocuSign and Adobe (and others) can all enjoy rapid growth during this time.As DocuSign continues to move upstream to larger clients, it will likely need to expand its sales and servicing headcount to deal with more complex issues. SMB customers tend to be more nimble and more willing to go the self-service route, whereas enterprise customers expect a considerably higher level of service in our view.From an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, perspective, data breaches and service outages are a concern for any type of cloud software provider. DocuSign has personal information, including sensitive legal signature data, housed within its data centers. Like other software companies, DocuSign also faces employee retention and hiring risk given the competitive nature of Silicon Valley.","We assign DocuSign a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think investments back into the business are most likely to be the key driver of total shareholder returns and are therefore appropriately prioritized over other capital returns such as dividends, which DocuSign does not offer, and buybacks, which the company did for the first time in fiscal 2023. The balance sheet is sound with a modest net cash position and a relatively small gross debt burden. We do not view the companys debt as problematic and we expect the balance sheet to remain sound thereafter as EBITDA continues to scale over the next several years.Capital has been allocated to continued scaling of the business, with occasional small acquisitions. DocuSign does not pay dividends, which we would not expect given the company remains in a hypergrowth phase, but has a $200 million share repurchase authorization for the first time ever beginning in March 2022.In September 2022, Allan Thygesen was announced as the companys CEO. In March 2023, CFO Cynthia Gaylor announced she was leaving the company, and was replaced by Blake Grayson. We generally view management turnover as negative, and this is no exception. That opinion is not founded on the incoming executives, as we find Thygesen and Grayson as capable.","DocuSign offers the Agreement Cloud, a broad cloud-based software suite that enables users to automate the agreement process and provide legally binding e-signatures from nearly any device. The company was founded in 2003 and completed its IPO in May 2018.","We believe DocuSign is a financially sound company with a solid balance sheet, improving margins, and rapidly growing revenue. Capital is generally allocated to growth efforts and acquisitions, with no dividends on the horizon. The company did undertake an opportunistic buyback late in fiscal 2023, which we do not anticipate will be a trend.As of fiscal 2023, DocuSign had $1.03 billion in cash and marketable securities, compared with $723 million in debt. DocuSign generated free cash flow margins, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, averaging 18% over the last three fiscal years. We expect free cash flow margins to expand over the next five years. The debt relates to convertible notes due in fiscal 2024. We are confident that DocuSign can satisfy its obligations while continuing to fund normal operations.DocuSign does not pay a dividend, nor do we expect the company to do so within the next several years, although it did engage in an opportunistic share buyback in fiscal 2023. The company has made a variety of relatively small acquisitions, including Seal, totaling in excess of $400 million over the last several years. We view these as feature additions or product extensions that are additive to the companys product development efforts. While we acknowledge the timing and size of potential future acquisitions may vary, we nonetheless model a modest level of acquisitions annually.",DOCU,Technology,9345397760.0,NMS,5938324.0,USD,42.7400016784668,True,1,44.82682351504353,55.30554887725244,1
24/11/2023,TJX Value Proposition Benefiting From Consumer Caution in the Full-Price Channel,TJX Companies Inc,TJX,2,15/11/2023,Jaime Katz,89.95,USD,23/11/2023,73.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,15/11/2023,"We believe TJXs stellar fiscal 2024 third-quarter marks testify to its ability to navigate the tough macroenvironment, thanks to its high-quality value offerings and scavenger hunt shopping experience. During the quarter, TJX saw 9% top-line growth, to $13.3 billion, and a 12% pretax profit margin (up 80 basis points annually on higher sales and benefit from expense timing), outpacing our $12.9 billion and 11.3% preprint estimates, respectively. Still, the updated fourth-quarter outlook of 10.4%-10.6% pretax profit margin (from 10.7%-10.9% prior) and reiterated 3%-4% comparable sales imply more margin pressure than previously anticipated due to higher expenses. In aggregate, this should lead to a modest lift in our outlook for sales of $54 billion and EPS of $3.66, which will bring us in line with updated full-year guidance for 4%-5% comps and $3.71-$3.74 in EPS. As such, we dont plan a material change to our $73 fair value estimate. Shares still strike us as rich at a 20%-plus premium, even after a 3% drop after the print. Unpacking the quarter, strength was seen across categories (apparel and home) and income demographics, with all TJXs banners posting positive comps entirely driven by increased traffic. Marmaxx and HomeGoods (61% and 17% of sales, respectively) were bright spots, as comps each jumped 7% and 9% as its fresh, value-priced assortments continue to attract bargain-seeking customers amid an unsettled economic backdrop. In this context, we believe TJX is uniquely positioned to operate well in a challenging environment (where we typically see softening demand in discretionary categories in which TJX plays) due to its flexible inventory sourcing approach, value proposition, and strategic vendor relationships that underpin our narrow moat rating. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our long-term prospects for the business, and we view our mid-single-digit average annual sales growth and low-double-digit pretax profit margins as attainable.","With an agile merchandising and distribution network, TJX keeps inventory fresh, spurring traffic while minimizing risks associated with fashion trends and freeing capital. We believe digital retailers will have a more difficult time encroaching on the off-price channel, considering the sector's already-low prices and vendors' demand for discretion. TJX's international operations should offer ample runway for growth and associated incremental cost leverage, with the store banners and off-price concept translating well abroad.","Inflation and economic uncertainty pose many near-term challenges as TJX works to navigate shifting spending patterns. Competition in retail is fierce, necessitating continued investment in the stores and low prices to maintain traffic. Digital retailers have struggled to usurp TJX's off-price strength, but their efforts to build cost leverage, ease returns, and price even more aggressively could create strain, and the pandemic provide an accelerated adoption.",17/08/2023,"Despite ongoing inflation and an unsettled economy, we believe TJX and the rest of the off-price sector are better suited than most retailers, with potential for improved merchandise availability as shifting spending patterns upset full-price stores merchandise orders. We still believe TJX and its peers benefit from durable advantages over full-price apparel and home dcor sellers, with strong brands, store experiences, and scale working to keep returns on invested capital high (averaging 30% over the next decade). TJX's value proposition should resonate even as retail competition intensifies. While digital retailers are a factor (particularly if the pandemic durably increases e-commerce adoption), we see the off-price channel as relatively well protected, as the low-frills buying experience and 20%-60% discounts relative to the full-price channel result in competitive prices and superior economics after considering shipping and return costs. Vendors desire for discretion also favors physical stores that can discreetly sell merchandise without diluting top brands cachet. With a global presence, TJX leverages an extensive merchandising operation and proprietary inventory management system to maintain a fast-changing assortment at significant discounts. We believe TJX's ability to deliver a high-value lineup while maintaining strong returns is driven by its difficult-to-replicate sourcing and distribution agility. By accepting incomplete assortments without return privileges, paying promptly, and stocking brands discreetly (preserving labels' conventional-channel pricing power by avoiding the stigma of a consistent discount presence), TJX is a valued partner for its more than 21,000 vendors, in our view. As a result, TJX can opportunistically offer a fast-changing, high-value assortment in a treasure-hunt format that is difficult to replicate digitally.","We assign TJX a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets (including a proprietary inventory management system and strong vendor relationships) and a cost advantage. The company's long history of financial performance is consistent with our assessment, with adjusted returns on invested capital averaging 22% over the last decade, well above our 9% weighted average cost of capital estimate. Furthermore, the company's 24-year streak of positive comparable-store sales growth leading up to the pandemic (with only one year other than fiscal 2021 with a decline in its more than 40-year history) overlapped a variety of economic and competitive environments, including the financial crisis and ensuing recession, giving us confidence in its business model's appeal to customers under a variety of business cycle scenarios. We expect economic profits to build as conditions normalize, with our 10-year average estimate of adjusted return on invested capital at 30%.The full-price retail channel (particularly department stores) sells an assortment of apparel from a relatively stable roster of brands, ordered well in advance and in large quantities. Retailers and manufacturers work together to ensure ample supply, with stores motivated through advertising or markdown allowances to ensure inventory clears, delivery concessions, and return privileges for excess merchandise. TJX's business model differs considerably. The firm uses a far more flexible inventory sourcing approach, relying on a team of over 1,200 buyers sourcing products from over 21,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. The company attempts to be the retailer of choice for vendors (generally manufacturers) looking to sell excess brand-name merchandise quickly. TJX accomplishes this by dispensing with retail, promotional, and delivery concessions as well as return rights, all while paying promptly (payable days around 35 in a normalized environment, versus 110-120 for Macy's) and buying opportunistically, including in less-than-full assortments and with less than a full complement of sizes. In exchange, TJX secures products at lower prices that allow it to undercut full-price retailers by 20%-60%, capitalizing on its significant bargaining power with suppliers.The company's business model is enabled by a flexible store and distribution architecture as well as a customer value proposition that focuses on the in-store treasure hunt. TJX's assortment is rapidly changing, with brands and items rotating based on availability. This encourages bargain-seeking customers to visit the stores frequently, spurring traffic and repeat store visits that are further stimulated by the firm's loyalty program. The reputation for flexibility and a volatile assortment allows TJX to be opportunistic, with loosely defined departments that can expand and contract as demand and product availability warrant. The stores provide an ideal venue for monetizing the companys vendor relationships, which enable TJX to serve as a partner of choice for vendors who rely on it to clear inventory quickly and with minimal risk. The relationships and customer experience feed on each other, with TJX's vendor relationships enabling a low-cost, high-value branded assortment that draws customers, traffic that adds to TJX's value to its suppliers.We anticipate TJX will continue to have the pick of a large pool of attractive inventory. The volatile retail environment and fickle customer tastes make demand forecasting challenging for manufacturers and retailers alike, with demand projections often overly optimistic (a dynamic that has only become more pronounced as digital retailers proliferate). Product availability has been more than adequate for decades, and we expect the company's scale to give it access to the most attractive opportunities as its long history and established, national presence attract vendors. TJX's fast inventory turnover (around 6 times in fiscal 2023, about double Macy's and about the same as Target's despite the latter's food lineup, which is faster-turning merchandise) limits the damage caused by misidentification of trends, and the firm's financial scale allows it to opportunistically buy excess inventory for use in later seasons (packaway) to match demand with attractively priced supply. Although off-price retailers have not been immune to rising freight and labor costs, we believe full-price shipment delays and rapidly changing consumer spending patterns should result in exceptional near-term buying opportunities for off-price merchants, and expect rising prices to focus customer attention on value.TJX also offers vendors the opportunity to sell excess inventory of designer merchandise discreetly, which is important for manufacturers looking to maintain their brands' cachet by avoiding being seen as a discount label. The company does not expect to maintain a steady inventory of a particular item or brand; as a result, manufacturers avoid the stigma of being a regular, featured presence in an off-price store. Rather than advertise the brands it stocks, TJX's marketing focuses on the store banners themselves, and customers are largely left to find the labels they desire on their own as part of the treasure-hunt experience. In this way, TJX's standing with customers reinforces itself by making the firm a more attractive partner for vendors, allowing the retailer to acquire better merchandise and provide greater values in store. We contend that the apparel retail sector offers few opportunities for firms to develop a durable competitive advantage, in part because we have long held that consumers generally look to product brands rather than the retailer's marquee. TJX's approach also addresses this challenge by featuring the store experience (a rapidly changing assortment of brand-name products at attractive prices) in its advertising rather than the labels sold.TJX's scale allows it to leverage a number of costs over a broad sales base, including advertising, merchandising, supply chain, and distribution expenditures. Furthermore, its size allows TJX to create significant insights from its customer data, enhanced by its loyalty program, TJX Rewards. We believe the company's international operations enhance its cost standing; while fashion trends differ sharply across borders, TJX's geographic dispersion makes it a more valuable partner to multinational vendors that face excess inventory issues across all of their operating areas, even if the specific items differ.Despite TJX's history of performance, we think the firm's competitive advantages fall short of earning a wide economic moat rating. While we believe that TJX should be able to comfortably generate economic returns over the next decade, the years beyond that point carry increasing risk as digital retailers develop additional distribution scale (leveraging shipping costs), make returns easier, and use technology (such as virtual and augmented reality) to ensure customers receive products that fit and are in line with their aesthetic preferences.","We assign TJX a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.TJX faces an unsettled landscape amid economic uncertainty. Inflation can pressure discretionary income, although unemployment remains low and an increasing focus on value should favor off-price stores. Supply chain disruptions can create near-term costs while potentially improving product availability. Over the longer term, intense competition in a sector with negligible switching costs constitutes the main threat to our outlook.TJX has long delivered sales growth in myriad market conditions. However, the pace of change in retail is brisk, with upheaval coming as digital retailers develop distribution and supply chain scale, physical sellers attempt to keep pace through aggressive cost control and pricing, and manufacturers increasingly sell directly to customers. We believe the motivations that lead vendors to sell desirable product at attractive terms to TJX will remain intact (particularly as the new channels make demand forecasting challenging) and that customers will continue to respond to the values offered. However, results could deviate from this expectation, possibly a result of competitive encroachment on the off-price segment or improved production forecasting technology, or conversely a greater-than-anticipated shift from traditional physical retail into the off-price sector (as the lack of switching costs cuts both ways).We see few environmental, social, or governance risks, mostly concentrated in the management of a global workforce in varying jurisdictions. While the apparel manufacturing industry can draw scrutiny regarding its labor practices, we see the risk largely confined to producers; furthermore, TJXs assortment is drawn from thousands of suppliers.","We assign the company a Standard Morningstar capital allocation rating.Under CEO Ernie Herrman, who took the helm in 2016, TJX has continued to feature a sound balance sheet, with a conservative approach to leverage that has left it in a net cash position each year over the last decade. We applaud managements prudence and expect funds generated from operations can support continued outlays in service of international and home store expansion and share repurchases.TJXs investment record is fair, with the company deploying resources to expand its store footprint. Expansion in established TJX markets like the United States adds to store density, which we believe is positive as it allows for greater leverage over distribution, supply chain, and advertising costs while making the company more valuable to vendors. Additionally, the Homesense introduction in the United States adds new but adjacent categories (furniture) that should bolster the chains off-price strength in home fashions without diluting the HomeGoods brand. Internationally, TJX has worked to add density as well as build a presence in new geographies, which we expect to continue. We had a cautiously favorable view of its purchase of a 25% stake in Familia, Russias lone sizable off-price apparel and home goods seller, for $225 million, as the off-price concept has proven appeal abroad (including in nearby Poland, where TJX has had a presence for 10 years), and the minority structure allowed management to limit risk as it explored a market with political and regulatory conditions that can charitably be described as challenging. The companys move to sell the stake in the wake of Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine is not surprising and should not have a material economic impact. The firm has taken a measured approach to e-commerce globally; we see this approach as wise, considering the off-price sectors resistance to digitization.TJXs shareholder distributions have largely been appropriate and have not come at the expense of continued investment in its capabilities. The organization has generally repurchased shares at levels near or below our valuation, though buybacks have periodically come at premiums. TJX steadily raised its dividend in the years before the pandemic (with payouts growing at a 22% compounded annual rate from fiscal 2011 to 2020, to nearly 35% of earnings); we see the payouts as reasonable considering the companys ongoing growth aspirations.","TJX is a leading off-price retailer of apparel, home fashions, and other merchandise. It sells a variety of branded goods, opportunistically buying inventory from a network of over 21,000 vendors worldwide. TJX targets undercutting conventional retailers' regular prices by 20%-60%, capitalizing on a flexible merchandising network, low-frills stores, and a treasure-hunt shopping experience to drive margins and inventory turnover. TJX derived 77% of fiscal 2023 revenue from the United States, with 12% from Europe (mostly the United Kingdom and Germany), 10% from Canada, and the remainder from Australia. The company operated more than 4,800 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 under the T.J. Maxx, T.K. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, Homesense, and Sierra banners.","TJX's financial health is sound, with $4.6 billion of cash against $2.9 billion of total debt at the end of July 2023. The firm has a historically conservative approach to debt that we do not expect to change. With cash flow to the firm averaging 7% of sales over the last five years and a similar mark expected of the next decade, we do not foresee much need for outside funding.Management states that its maximum store count potential is 3,000 units at Marmaxx (from 2,482 at the end of fiscal 2023), 1,500 at HomeGoods (from 940), 650 in Canada (from 554), and 1,125 in its existing other international markets (from 781). We expect it will take about 10 years to approach these targets, with TJX likely adding new international markets in that time. We anticipate TJX will continue to favor leasing stores, though store expansion should remain its capital priority. We expect capital expenditures to account for 2%-3% of sales long term.TJX has returned capital via share buybacks and dividends. We assume about 45% of annual operating cash flow is returned to investors through repurchases long term, and that the dividend payout ratio remains near fiscal 2020s 34% (before the pandemic), at around 40%. The firm could also pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth, though we do not incorporate such purchases into our forecasts because of the uncertain timing and nature of any deal.",TJX,Consumer Cyclical,101477105664.0,NYQ,4939789.0,USD,89.94999694824219,True,0,89.21235252828707,94.70555519762593,1
24/11/2023,Telus Is in a Good Spot With Wireless and Fixed-Line Offerings,TELUS Corp,T,5,03/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,24.04,CAD,23/11/2023,33.0,Low,Narrow,Exemplary,A,03/11/2023,"Our takeaway from Telus third-quarter results was strikingly similar to peer BCEs report a day earlier. Telus posted good telecom results that saw it continuing to add broadband customers to its fiber network and a near-record number of mobile phone subscribers. But Telus results also showed signs of increasing wireless competition after Quebecor entered the national market in the spring. Customer churn took a notable tick up, and average revenue per user, or ARPU, declined. The competitive environment and limited ability to expand ARPU have been part of our thesis for the Big Three Canadian wireless carriers. Were maintaining our projections and our CAD 33 fair value estimate for Telus. We see each of the Big Three as undervalued. Telus added 160,000 net mobile phone customers, the best result of any quarter since 2008. Like BCE, Telus accomplished this despite a rise in churn, to 1%. Competition was also a factor in the 0.5% ARPU decline, the first year-over-year drop since early 2021. We dont expect ARPU to rise very much throughout our forecast because of the competitive environment. However, the ongoing robust level of new customer additions each quarter, which should have legs due to Canadas expansive immigration policy, should continue to drive solid sales growth. We still believe fixed-line services are where Telus has a bigger advantage, with its fiber network and lack of legacy satellite television customers. Telus added another 37,000 net broadband customers, continuing to steadily increase the subscriber base by about 1.5% every quarter. It also added another 20,000 net television customers. These drove 5% year-over-year growth in fixed data services revenue. Apart from the value we believe Telus fiber network has for directly driving fixed-line subscribers and sales, it is also key to giving Telus an attractive bundling offer that can differentiate it for some wireless customers and is leading to other cost efficiencies.","With the buildout of FTTH, Telus' wireline network quality has eclipsed that of primary competitor Shaw over much of its footprint. This should propel continued strength in wireline pricing, margins, and share gains.  The Canadian governments goal of significantly increasing immigration should prompt high levels of subscriber growth for all wireless incumbents, and Telus is second to none. Telus free cash generation should rise significantly and stay elevated as it has now passed the bulk of the capital spending associated with its fiber network overhaul.","A combined Quebecor and Freedom Mobile should make for Canadas strongest-ever fourth national wireless competitor, and it will undercut the Big Three on price, limiting pricing power and pressuring margins. Regulators' preference for competition and presence in the industry will keep a lid on incumbents' profits and business potential.  Telus' aggressive pursuit of nascent, noncore businesses for high valuations bring higher risks than typically associated with telecom stability, albeit with more potential upside.",03/11/2023,"We think Telus wireline unit is its best business and the one most likely to drive future returns. The firm has replaced most of its legacy copper network with fiber, significantly upgrading the quality. We think this strategy has set Telus up for a prolonged period of success. Telus has already taken significant market share from Shaw, its primary competitor in the western Canadian geographies where it competes. In addition to further success we expect in adding subscribers because of the better capability the fiber network offers, we believe the fiber network gives Telus more pricing power and is more efficient, leading to reduced costs. We also see Telus with strength in its wireless segment, but we simply think it will remain one of the leaders in a very competitive market. With just less than 30% share of Canadian wireless customers, it is one of the Big Three national providers, along with Rogers and BCE, that collectively serve almost 90% of the market. It also has a network-sharing agreement with BCE that we think makes the service it provides second to none. However, we think a combination of Quebecor and Freedom Mobile will give Canada the strongest fourth competitor the country has seen in many years. Nonetheless, we expect Telus' wireless business to benefit from subscriber growth throughout the industry. We think that Telus' network strength will help it keep pace with peers but that fierce competition will weigh on pricing power throughout the industry.  Unlike its peers, Telus has also made substantial investments in businesses that are not typically related to telecom. Although the firm generally thinks its telecom network will be an advantage for those businesses, we think they have a high degree of uncertainty and risk. These peripheral businesses--namely in the health, security, and agriculture industries, are typically small and fast-growing but not necessarily profitable. We generally see high potential upside but also the possibility for a drag on returns on invested capital. The firm also maintains a majority stake in Telus International, an IT Services outsourcing and consulting firm that Telus carved out TI via an IPO in early 2021. ","Telus' narrow moat stems from efficient scale and cost advantages in its wireless business and efficient scale in wireline. Telus' adjusted returns on invested capital have been depressed over the past three yearsaveraging about 7% versus 10%-11% in the preceding decadeas the firm has participated in multiple big wireless spectrum auctions and accelerated its capital spending to rebuild its fixed network with fiber. However, we think 2023 is an inflection point that will mark the start of increasing ROICs each year over our five-year forecast. The firm largely completed its new fiber buildout in 2022, and we dont expect spectrum auctions in the next couple of years to be nearly as big as those in 2019 and 2021. In wireless, Telus is one of the three big national competitors, and we believe these three firms have solid moats that protect them from any current or future competition. Rogers, BCE, and Telus share 90% of the total market and operate with an efficient scale. Building and maintaining a wireless network is very capital-intensive, and we think the modest economic returns that national incumbents generate typically result in prospective national competitors either unable to fund a competing network or deciding against it. Even regulatory incentives announced in 2021 coaxed only Quebecor, which already had a thriving wireless business in Quebec, to expand nationally, and we think Quebecors future success will depend on its acquisition of Freedom Mobile, which already operated in complementary provinces. With the scale that the incumbents have come significant cost advantages over all smaller rivals, as they can spread their marketing, overhead, and other fixed costs over comparatively massive subscriber bases.Nearly all of Telus' wireline footprint is in British Columbia and Alberta, where in both places it is the incumbent local exchange carrier. Telus' primary competitor in those provinces is Shaw, and the two companies address virtually the entire market with similar shares. We see the two companies operating with efficient scale, as hypothetical competitors would be starting from scratch and needing to build a very expensive network to compete. Historically, Telus competed with an inferior network, as its legacy copper network couldn'tt compare to the speed and quality of the hybrid fiber-coax network of Shaw. However, Telus has now upgraded most of its footprint with fiber to the home. Apart from the speed and the higher-quality service, FTTH has several advantages for Telus, including lower operating expenses due to less maintenance and customer calls, lower churn rates, and higher average revenue per user. We expect improved margins and a diminished cost disadvantage relative to Shaw over the next few years, and we think Telus has positioned its network as an even stronger competitor.The biggest factor keeping us from labeling Telus a wide-moat company is the ever-present threat of further regulation in the telecom industry. Management itself has stated that historically, onerous government intervention has been more problematic than competition from other companies. Telecom services are sometimes viewed as public utilities (a classification that the U.S. government used regarding broadband internet when it was defending net neutrality), and the government tends to keep a watchful eye over service offerings, competition, and network requirements. In the wireless space, the government seemingly favors more robust competition for the top three providers, as evidenced by it historically giving other competitors favored status in spectrum auctions, and it has mandated minimal levels of service offerings with a capped price for national providers. In wireline, we believe the Canadian government views broadband as a public good to some extent, which leaves a threat of things like price caps, mandatory network sharing, or other means of enhancing competition. With that in mind, we cannot assume that the environment that the firm has historically navigated will persist, and our level of confidence in long-term projections is tempered by the industry's sensitivity to government influence.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Telus is Low. Given consumers' reliance on wireless and broadband connections that we expect to increase, Telus should produce stable growth with limited opportunity for big upside surprises but a floor to the downside due to industry trends and the moats of the biggest telecom firms. The biggest environmental, social, and governance risk we see revolves around the essential function in society of broadband and wireless service, which means regulators may take a heavy hand in ensuring providers reach all residents for reasonable pricespotentially limiting pricing power and forcing higher spending even when it doesnt make economic sense. We consider this element in our forecast, but a new level of regulation than weve historically seen could bring further pressure. Potential data breaches, given Telus access and transport of sensitive data, and business disruptions of what's now essentially a utility would also be risks.In its operations, we expect the core wireless and wireline businesses to be stable, but the higher exposure Telus now has to peripheral businesses brings more potential volatility in our view. Further, managements interest in these businesses could lead to significant capital outlays for additional acquisitions for businesses with very uncertain financial performance.We think a combined Quebecor and Freedom Mobile as a fourth national wireless competitor leads to greater risk of market share loss or long-term ARPU declines. Wireline risks in Telus' business stem mostly from secular telecom trends that we expect to lead to perpetual declines in traditional TV and fixed-line voice services. However, Telus has much lower exposure to those businesses than BCE, and TV has been a strength because of the lack of satellite customers. Still, a mirroring of the TV-industry trend or a faster decline in voice subscribers than we project would reduce Telus wireline revenue growth, which we project to outpace peers.","We assign Telus an Exemplary capital allocation rating. Our rating is based on our assessment of Telus balance sheet and our outlook regarding investment in the business and shareholder distributions. We think business investment is likely to be the primary driver of shareholder returns and is what leads to our Exemplary rating.Telus has a history of good investment decisions that we expect to continue. When the wireless industry was in its early days and Telus was a regional wireline operator, CEO Darren Entwistle led Telus to acquire wireless operator Clearnet in a then-record CAD 6.6 billion Canadian telecom deal. The stock dropped 10% on the news, but the deal proved to be a home run, as wireless is now the firms biggest business, and Telus has a 30% national wireless market share. More recently, we attribute Telus investment in fiber with the strength in that segment and think it has created significant value. Historically, Telus legacy copper phone network was inferior to primary competitor Shaws cable network. Closing the performance gap with a superior fiber-based network has allowed Telus to take wireline market share while being able to charge higher prices and lowering costs. Fiber should also be a further advantage as the wireless industry moves more toward 5G. We believe the strategy to invest in fiber has strengthened the firms competitive advantages in its core telecom businesses and should drive outperformance for years to come.Telus has also invested in many peripheral businesses with a history of success. We think the jury is out on whether the more aggressive move to non-telecom businesses will prove wise, but managements track record should earn it the benefit of the doubt. The firm carved out Telus International in early 2021 to monetize part of that investment while retaining majority ownership. We think the move was wise, and a similar blueprint for other businesses could add value.In our view, Telus shareholder return strategy is mixed, as we believe annual dividend increases have been higher than necessary and have led to stretched payout ratios. Telus dividend was CAD 1.36 in 2022, a 7% increase versus the prior year, and the stock yielded nearly 5% for most of 2022. Weve felt the dividend payout was a little aggressive, but with Telus now past most of its fiber spending, we expect the firms payout ratio and debt leverage to come down. We think this should enable the annual 7% dividend increases to which shareholders have become accustomed to persist. Share repurchases have not been a part of Telus strategy to return capital to shareholders, and while we believe the stock has had periods of being undervalued, we havent seen a reason why a big shift in strategy would be necessary. Nonetheless, wed be in favor of more opportunistic share repurchases while moderating the aggressive dividend increases. Telus has a sound balance sheet. Its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio has risen since 2019, as the firm was accelerating its fiber buildout program. After historically sitting in the mid-2 range, it has trended toward the mid-3 range. With less fiber spending, we expect the leverage ratio to slowly trend down, even as the firm continues returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders and Telus participates in any upcoming wireless spectrum auctions. We project a rise in wireless capital spending to only partially offset the much lower wireline spending resulting from the fiber network overhaul now largely completed.","Telus is one of the Big Three wireless service providers in Canada, with its nearly 10 million mobile phone subscribers nationwide constituting about 30% of the total market. It is the incumbent local exchange carrier in the western Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, where it provides internet, television, and landline phone services. It also has a small wireline presence in eastern Quebec. Mostly because of recent acquisitions, more than 20% of Telus sales now come from nontelecom businesses, most notably in the international business services, health, security, and agriculture industries. The firm has a 55% economic stake in Telus International. ","We think Telus is in a good financial position. Though it ended 2022 with net debt/EBITDA of 3.6, which is historically high for Telus, we expect the ratio to decline to 2.5 by 2026, since its fiber buildout is largely complete. At the end of 2022, the company had about CAD 1 billion in cash and an interest coverage ratio (adjusted EBITDA/interest expense) of nearly 10.0. We dont expect Telus to get anywhere close to the limits required by its debt covenants (requiring debt/adjusted EBITDA below 4.0 and interest coverage above 2.0). Telus has CAD 2.0 billion in debt maturing in 2023 followed by an average of CAD 1.5 billion in each of the following four years, but it had CAD 1.3 billion available on its revolving credit facility at the end of 2022, and we dont expect it will have any difficulty rolling over its obligations.Debt levels have recently been higher than usual due to the costly fiber buildout and the spectrum auctions of 2019 and 2021. These costs are now mostly behind Telus, as fiber building will slow and near-term spectrum auctions should not be as big as the prior two. We don't project Telus to engage in any major M&A activity, but the firm has shown its always interested. We also, however, think Telus may carve out some of its peripheral businesses, such as health and agriculture, similar to what it did with Telus International. These factors should result in higher cash flow, which should allow for greater shareholder return concurrently with a reduction in the firms debt leverage ratio. We expect the firm to raise its dividend by about 7% annually (in line with the average historical practice) and think it will begin to repurchase shares within the next few years, something it has not done much of since the middle of last decade.",T.TO,Communication Services,36345901056.0,TOR,5423667.0,CAD,24.049999237060547,True,1,23.14321433930357,23.941951216720728,0
24/11/2023,Keysights Broad and Deep Communications Portfolio Offers Good Growth and a Wide Moat,Keysight Technologies Inc,KEYS,4,21/11/2023,William Kerwin,135.72,USD,23/11/2023,166.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,21/11/2023,"We modestly trim our fair value estimate for shares of wide-moat Keysight Technologies to $166, from $170, to reflect lowered expectations for fiscal 2024. We reiterate our confidence in Keysight for the long term, and its ability to rebound from current soft end-market demand. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Keysight saw a continuation of the weak spending environment for telecom customers that has hamstrung orders across fiscal 2023. The firm is now encountering additional weakness out of its consumer and semiconductor end markets, particularly in China, which leads us to taper our short-term forecasts. We now expect a low-single-digit sales decline in fiscal 2024, driven entirely by weaker end markets. We continue to forecast an inflection back to healthy growth for the firm in fiscal 2025 and forecast longer-term growth driven by wireless network, broadband, and data center buildouts and supplemented by artificial intelligence. We believe Keysight will gain share in communications testing with unmatched portfolio breadth and depth, which also underpins its wide moat rating. We see shares as undervalued. October quarter sales dropped 9% year over year and 5% sequentially to $1.31 billion, at the high end of management guidance. Commercial communications continued its decline dropping 17% year over year and 7% sequentially. This end market declined 7% in fiscal 2023 for Keysight, led largely by weaker spending at data center and wireless customers that we see as broad-based and not specific to Keysight. This was the first quarter of weakness for the electronic and industrial segment, or EISG, which dipped 7% year over year. EISG had served as an offset to communications weakness over fiscal 2023 with midteens growth in the past three quarters, but is seeing weaker spending in China, where Keysight has consumer and semiconductor manufacturing exposure.","We think Keysights large research and development budget has created a competitively advantaged portfolio for communications testing that we dont expect other firms would be able to easily replicate. Keysight holds a majority share of the 5G testing market, which we think will elicit strong top-line growth and expand profitability over the next five years. We expect Keysight to convert over 100% of net income into free cash flow, and predict it to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow annually over our forecast.","We think Keysight faces an uphill battle to disrupt an automotive testing market which we think is more fragmented and competitive. In our view, Keysights reliance on M&A to build out its portfolio creates risk of stagnating growth if its target pipeline dries up, or of destroying value if it overpays for bolt-ons. Keysights transition to a recurring revenue model for its software and services is still nascent, and we think the firm has a long way to go to increase the stickiness of its solutions.",21/11/2023,"We think Keysight Technologies is the leader in communications testing and measurement solutions, and offers a vendor-agnostic way to invest in the rapidly growing 5G and high-speed networking markets. In our view, Keysight has the strongest and broadest communications testing capabilities in the market, inclusive of hardware, software, and services. We think a comprehensive portfolio allows Keysight to act as a strategic partner to its customers, enabling new designs and accelerating time to market for network operators, network equipment OEMs, device OEMs, and suppliers.  We believe that Keysight can reduce time to market for customers more than competitors as a result of its end-to-end portfolio of premium offerings. We think Keysights leadership stems from its large investment in R&D that it focuses on the communications market. We also think hefty organic and inorganic investment has led to Keysight leading the market pivot toward software and credit its unmatched portfolio breadth for its top market share. We also contend that a broad portfolio that layers software and services on top of hardware embeds Keysight into customer workflows and entrenches customers in its ecosystem. A broad, sticky portfolio underpins our wide economic moat rating for the firm.  Keysight should continue to dominate the communications market, especially as it pivots toward more complex 5G testing in which it is already demonstrating proficiency. We forecast market share gains for Keysight and think greater complexity in 5G networks will expand its wallet share at customers--both of which would result in continued outperformance of the underlying testing market. We expect the firm to continue shifting customers to subscription billing for its software and services and think it will complement continued organic investment with strategic M&A to further build out its software portfolio. We expect the growing mix of software and services to expand margins. Finally, we forecast Keysight to continue generating impressive cash flow and to send a large proportion of it back to shareholders. ","In our view, Keysight Technologies possesses a wide economic moat owing to intangible assets in the design of test and measurement equipment and software and switching costs for its portfolio of solutions. We think Keysight is a leader in testing and measurement, helping OEMs and all tiers of suppliers accelerate time to market for new products in the communications, aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial, and semiconductor markets. We dont expect any competitor to encroach on Keysights leadership--especially in communications--and expect the firm to earn economic profits over the next 20 years as a result of its comprehensive portfolio that layers software and services over hardware. Testing equipment is used by OEMs and suppliers during research and development and manufacturing to fine tune chips and devices to exact specifications. For example, Keysight manufactures millimeter wave transceivers and radio frequency emulators to test an RF chipsets ability to transceive signals amid a variety of interference environments and signal strengths. Oscilloscopes can analyze the amplitude and frequency of a 5G signal in testing out a base stations effectiveness. Similarly, Ethernet channel testing solutions enable suppliers to test the effectiveness of optical transceivers in data transfer and connectivity in a data center, connected car, or other application. We believe Keysight is the leading player in the communications testing market, in part from being the only player to service the entire communications ecosystem. Keysights portfolio addresses all layers of the communications stack, from the physical layer all the way through to the application software layer. We think having the most comprehensive communications testing portfolio in the marketplace makes Keysight a more efficient solution and gives it a leg up in acquiring new customers. Testing is an integral part of the development process, with engineers iterating designs in simulation software, testing different prototypes, and then implementing quality control in manufacturing. Each step introduces new variables to account for, and using multiple testing vendors across development can require calibrating equipment together and ensuring measurement differences arent resulting from different equipment. By using Keysight tools and software at each step, engineers can remove variability between each step, saving critical development time and accelerating time to market. Keysight takes this one step further with its PathWave platform, which aggregates software analysis from each step of the development process into one place, reducing variability and iterations and simplifying the process for engineers. In one case study, NTT Docomo credits using a comprehensive Keysight solution for shortening development time for its 5G deployment at the Tokyo Olympics by at least 20% and going to market a full year faster than the competition. With a portfolio addressing all facets of communications and including software, Keysight stands out among its testing peers as a strategic partner. Rather than selling into a specific portion of a customers development, Keysight can offer a complete strategy for reducing time to market that features its tools and software. We think unmatched portfolio breadth and leading capabilities have led to Keysight holding one of the top market shares overall in testing and measurement, a leading position in communications, and a dominant share of the 5G testing market. Management estimates that Keysight holds 25% of the overall testing and measurement market and estimates that 75% of 5G designs globally--between base stations and devices--have been developed using Keysight solutions. We posit that Keysights advantage in communications testing and measurement stems from hefty investment in research and development and vertically integrated production. While some of its peers invest similar proportions of sales into R&D, Keysight exceeds all of them in size, so its total R&D investment in a given year nearly doubles that of the nearest competitor. We think large R&D investment has allowed Keysight to invest aggressively in software and be first to market with a platform like PathWave. Moreover, Keysight gains efficiency from partial vertical integration, with about 50% of manufacturing taking place in-house. The firm operates its own fab in Santa Rosa, California, which it co-locates with its R&D staff. This allows the firm to quickly take designs into production and troubleshoot, rather than waiting on a foundry partner with myriad other customers to serve. We think this improves R&D efficiency and allows Keysight to maintain its high organic investment while staying profitable. Among its peer group, Keysight is the only one in the top three of both R&D as a percentage of sales and operating margin. In our view, the ability to invest twice as much as competitors while maintaining top-tier operating profits gives us confidence in Keysights ability to maintain its innovation lead over the next 20 years. We also think Keysights moat is bolstered by switching costs, stemming from an end-to-end solution set combining hardware, software, and services. Keysights solutions service the entire design cycle, from design and simulation all the way through to volume manufacturing and operation. We view Keysight as a one-stop-shop for customers and think this leads to switching costs as entire workflows get designed around Keysights solutions. Keysights comprehensive portfolio not only improves efficiency at customers but makes ripping its solutions out even harder--a customer would likely have to source from multiple suppliers if it chose to leave Keysight. For example, Keysight is the only testing player to supply electronic design automation (EDA) software for chips, which is typically a standalone market. Switching away from Keysight would likely require sourcing from multiple new testing suppliers and a new EDA supplier, too. We also think that Keysights focus on selling into research and development versus manufacturing leads to stickier customer relationships. R&D relationships tend to be quite close-- sales usually involve one engineer at a time. In our view, individual engineers exhibit stronger personal preference and stickiness than a company as a whole--once an engineer adopts Keysight into their workflow (and so long as it satisfies their needs), we think theyd be loath to learn an entirely new solution. Furthermore, selling early in development to R&D makes Keysight more likely to win manufacturing placements later in development. Manufacturing testing (quality control) is typically dual-sourced, but if a given supplier is used in R&D, its likely to be used predominantly in manufacturing, further reducing variability between measurements. A second testing supplier would then be used as a check, ending in roughly a 70%/30% split for Keysight and the competitor, respectively. We think Keysight entrenches customers even further by layering software on top of its solutions. It is our view that layering software on top of enterprise hardware creates an overall stickier combined solution that engrains itself deeper in customer workflows. Although all oscilloscopes, signal analyzers, and other testing hardware run on embedded software, Keysight has been pivoting to proprietary analytical software to optimize testing and measurement with its hardware. Keysights applications save engineers time by automatically analyzing massive quantities of data--an oscilloscope can make 256 billion measurements per second--and Keysights customers can aggregate all their data and subsequent analysis in its PathWave platform. Moreover, Keysights applications are modifiable. A Keysight application engineer will help customize a program to fit an engineers specific requirements at installation. We think an integral software approach with customization embeds Keysights tools into customer workflows and makes cobbling together a replacement difficult. Customers would have to replace more than physical tools, and adapt entire workflows to new software--or face the prospect of not finding similar functionality from a new vendor. Finally, we think the inclusion of services into customer contracts further augments Keysights stickiness. We think services both elongate the average duration of contracts and further embed customers in the Keysight ecosystem. Keysight has 68 regional services centers globally and locates them near hubs of customers. Keysights services vary in intensity. At a base level, Keysight customers utilize repair and calibration services annually or biannually--equipment needs to be calibrated for accurate measurements, similar to tuning a guitar or violin. Additionally, Keysight application engineers can work with customers to offer troubleshooting, usage guidance, and tweaking of software. For large customers, application engineers will even work on-site at a customer, integrating into the design team. In our view, services allow a customer to use their solutions for longer and create a stickier overall solution as software and workflows become customized to having Keysight as an on-demand partner. We think deep partnership and services has led to long customer relationships--sometimes lasting decades. We think Keysights sticky portfolio has led to a strong base of high-margin recurring revenue that we think will enable it to continue earning excess returns on invested capital. According to management, adding services to a contract can double the gross margin of a deal--and come at little additional cost to the firm. We credit growing software and services sales for helping to expand gross margins since Keysights spinoff in 2014. Software and services now make up more than one third of Keysights top line, and we expect this number to expand. In 5G applications, which we expect to become a significant portion of sales, software alone can make up 40% of a contract. Additionally, over two thirds of Keysights engineers are now focused on software, and many of the firms recent acquisitions have been software-centric--exhibiting a companywide pivot toward software. In our view, strong recurring revenue gives us confidence in Keysights ability to retain customers in its ecosystem and in turn earn economic profits over a 20-year horizon.","We assign Keysight Technologies a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The firm is heavily exposed to the communications market, and we think any downturn or slowdown in this market would have an outsize effect on Keysights results. Additionally, much of our forecast for the firms top-line growth and profitability rests upon 5G network buildouts, and slower-than-expected adoption could hamper Keysights growth and profitability. We also think Keysight faces risk from its mix shift toward software. We view Keysight as the leader among its peers in the transition but think the pivot offers an opportunity for a competitor to disrupt the market. If Keysight fails to maintain its leadership in software, its competitive position could weaken. In our view, Keysights active M&A strategy poses another risk. We forecast a steady stream of tuck-in acquisitions for the company helping to pad growth and profitability. If the firm fails to make the right deals, or overpays for targets, it could hamper growth and destroy value. If Keysights inorganic strategy slows altogether, it could risk losing key additions to competitors and its competitive advantage could grow slimmer. Finally, we foresee minimal environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk for Keysight. The firms greatest material ESG issue (MEI) in our view is the risk of losing human capital to competitors, but we dont see evidence of this happening and think a strong variable compensation program helps keep talent motivated to remain at the firm.","We rate Keysight Technologies Capital Allocation as Standard, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Keysights stated capital allocation priorities, in order, are organic investment, strategic M&A, and share repurchases. We think Keysights balance sheet is in sound position, with a net cash position and long-dated debt maturities. We also think Keysights investment strategy is fair. We approve of the firms focus on organic investment, specifically in R&D, which we think has allowed it to carve out a wide economic moat. We also think that Keysights M&A strategy has given it access into high-growth future markets like quantum, and has helped it to transition to a more integrated software approach. Finally, we think Keysights shareholder distributions are appropriate. The firm targets sending 50% of its free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of repurchases. We also credit the firm for focusing on investment first, while using its heady free cash flow to send leftover cash to shareholders.","Keysight Technologies is a leader in the field of testing and measurement, helping electronics OEMs and suppliers alike bring products to market to fit industry standards and specifications. Keysight specializes in the communications market, but also supplies into the government, automotive, industrial, and semiconductor manufacturing markets. Keysights solutions include testing tools, analytical software, and services. The firms stated objective is to reduce time to market and improve efficiency at its more than 30,000 customers.","We expect Keysight Technologies to continue generating impressive cash flow, which we forecast will fund organic and inorganic investment as well as returns to shareholders. As of Oct. 31, 2023, the firm held a net cash position, with $2.5 billion in cash on hand and $1.8 billion in gross debt. We think the firm will stay leveraged-- especially with its current long-term maturities--but pay off its debt as it comes due. We forecast over 100% free cash flow conversion through fiscal 2028 and anticipate more than $1 billion in free cash flow annually during this period.",KEYS,Technology,24484042752.0,NYQ,1102774.0,USD,135.72000122070312,True,1,135.01094091078704,152.23320968062842,1
24/11/2023,Medtronics Efforts To Remodel Its Portfolio Are Beginning To Bear Fruit,Medtronic PLC,MDT,5,21/11/2023,Debbie Wang,78.37,USD,23/11/2023,112.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,21/11/2023,"Medtronic posted strong fiscal 2024 second-quarter results that put it on track to meet our full-year expectations, and were leaving our $112 fair value estimate unchanged. We think this quarter demonstrated more progress on the firm's larger objective of matching market growth. Organic revenue growth of 5% was fueled by strength in stent grafts for abdominal aortic aneurysm, the digital Aible system for spine procedures, and GI Genius, which incorporates artificial intelligence to better detect polyps during colonoscopy. Importantly, Medtronic recently obtained regulatory approval on several emerging technologies that we see as key growth drivers. These innovative new products reinforce the intangible assets that support Medtronics wide economic moat. We think the star of the second quarter was the diabetes business, which finally took a strong step toward growth thanks to the first full quarter of U.S. 780G pump sales. Domestic pump revenue growth exceeded 30% sequentially, and we think the differentiated features of this new pump should see solid adoption through the rest of the fiscal year. While performance of Medtronics accompanying continuous glucose monitor, especially the sensor, has lagged that of market leader Dexcom, the benefits of the 780G pumpparticularly the automated mealtime correctionsseem compelling enough to compensate for the current sensor. Nevertheless, CGM product cycles are relatively quick, and Medtronic recently received European regulatory approval for its one-piece Simplera CGM, which takes a big step toward closing the gap with Dexcoms G7. Recent U.S. regulatory approvals for Aurora (extravascular implantable defibrillator) and Symplicity Spryal (renal denervation for hypertension) should goose growth, as both differentiated technology platforms offer clinical benefits. We expect fairly quick adoption of Aurora, as reimbursement is already in place and electrophysiologists are familiar with this new technology.","Medtronic has historically held roughly 50% share in its core heart devices. It's also the market leader in spinal products, insulin pumps, and neuromodulators for chronic pain. Medtronic's pipeline contains treatments for atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and renal denervation for hypertension. If these new therapies prove effective, Medtronic could dominate three more potentially large markets. Medtronic often finds novel ways to apply familiar technologies, like using the implantable electronic stimulation in pacemakers to address fecal incontinence and chronic pain.","As smaller firms introduce new insulin pump technology, Medtronic may face a stiffer fight to maintain its leadership in this arena. Medtronic's devices are indirectly subject to Medicare reimbursement rates; increasing pressure on payments could hurt profitability. Over the years, Medtronic has issued a number of voluntary recalls of some of its products. Although the fatalities associated with these problems have been few, recalls generally require time and effort, and potentially, legal settlements.",15/06/2023,"Medtronic's standing as the largest pure-play medical-device maker remains a force to be reckoned with in the med-tech landscape. Pairing Medtronic's diversified product portfolio aimed at a wide range of chronic diseases with its expansive selection of products for acute care in hospitals has bolstered Medtronic's position as a key partner for its hospital customers.  Medtronic has historically focused on innovation, designing and manufacturing devices to address cardiac care, neurological and spinal conditions, and diabetes. All along, the firm has remained focused on its fundamental strategy of innovation. It is often first to market with new products and has invested heavily in internal research and development efforts as well as acquiring emerging technologies. However, in the postreform healthcare world where there are higher hurdles for securing reimbursement for next-generation technology, Medtronic has slightly shifted its strategy to include partnering more closely with its hospital clients by offering greater breadth of products and services to help hospitals operate more efficiently. By partnering more closely and integrating itself into more hospital operations, Medtronic is well positioned to take advantage of more business opportunities in the value-based reimbursement environment, in our view. In particular, Medtronic has been pioneering risk-based contracting around some of its cardiac and diabetes products, which we think is attractive to hospital clients and payers alike. We have always appreciated Medtronic's diverse portfolio, where certain waning product lines would be offset by growth in other categories. Management has recently taken a more active role in pruning the product portfolio with the intent to ramp up growth. The COVID-19 disruption added more near-term turbulence, especially with supply chain issues and delays in nonpandemic patient volume, but we remain confident that underlying demand for many of these therapies and Medtronic's ongoing innovation should prevail over the longer term.","Medtronic's wide moat is rooted in its dominant presence in highly engineered medical devices to treat chronic diseases, including those beyond its historical stronghold in heart disease. Medtronic's strongest moat source is intangible assets and to a lesser extent switching costs that are associated with specific products. In the cardiac area, Medtronic competes with roughly three competitors in total across its heart-related portfolio. The markets for pacemakers, ICDs, coronary stents, heart valves, and neuromodulation generally operate as rational oligopolies. There are some switching costs related to cardiac rhythm management devices and transcatheter aortic heart valves.In the spine area, Medtronic's moat is strengthened by high switching costs for surgeons. Doctors often rely on medical-device sales reps for their deep device knowledge as well as their experience with device usage in a wide range of patients. As a result, Medtronic's reps play the role of highly specialized experts who advise practitioners on implantation, programming, and maintenance of Medtronic devices and create sticky relationships with medical practitioners. This dynamic tends to keep spinal surgeons loyal to Medtronic's products, as long as the company does not fall too far behind its competitors when it comes to introducing new technology. Finally, Medtronic's wide moat is bolstered by several intangibles, including intellectual property and carefully nurtured relationships with physicians. Thanks to its persistent ability to innovate, Medtronic is often first to market with new products in various therapeutic areas. We expect Medtronic to continue its record of innovation, based on its extensive patent portfolio. According to independent intellectual property evaluation publications Device Link and The Patent Board, Medtronic holds the strongest intellectual property position based on number and technological strength of its patents. We think Medtronic's diversified medical technology portfolio allows it to better weather occasional glitches in the development or approval process for any particular new device. Investments in neuromodulation, diabetes, and spinal products from the middle to late 1990s paid off in spades through 2010. Although the spine and ICD businesses have been hit with slower market growth since then, the firm has seen double-digit growth in its diabetes, surgical technologies, drug-coated balloons, neurovascular, and atrial fibrillation segments. While some of Medtronic's product lines have waned as new clinical data has altered treatment guidelines, the firm continues to invest in emerging technologies, including renal denervation and transcatheter mitral valves, that should drive future growth. The addition of Covidien deepened Medtronic's competitive advantages, as Covidien's medical-device segment enjoys brand recognition, technological innovation, and substantial scale. Most of Covidien's device subsegments operate in an oligopolistic fashion; the absence of irrational price competition and the evolutionary (rather than revolutionary) nature of innovation tend to lead to only marginal share shifts in the industry and strong excess returns. Covidien currently ranks at or near the top in all product categories where it competes in devices and vies mainly with Johnson & Johnson; the rest of the field is typically highly fragmented, with most companies occupying product niches rather than competing broadly against the big two. We have seen few new entrants making significant inroads. New competitors sometimes pop up on the margins, ranging from less sophisticated (discounted prices) to high-end (technological advancements), but they rarely result in monumental market shifts. The existing players' positioning is very defensible, with most practitioners rarely switching to competitors' products because of inertia as well as up-front training costs. While surgeons' influence over procurement decisions is arguably waning, the established players also have administrators' ears. In terms of environmental, social, and governance issues, Sustainalytics rates Medtronic's ESG risk at medium, and we concur. The risk profile is driven primarily by exposure to potential defects in life-sustaining products, such as cardiac rhythm management devices, insulin pumps, and heart valves. Some of this risk is mitigated by Medtronic's strong management measures.As with other cardiac device makers, Medtronic has also weathered periodic product recalls, ensuing litigation, and ponied up funds to settle suits. However, we note none of the recalls we've observed in two decades has permanently damaged Medtronic's economic profits or its reputation with practitioners. There are several reasons for this. First, because device markets are relatively small, the pool of complainants usually numbers in the thousands or tens of thousands, not millions of people. This translates into settlements that are relatively small and manageable.Second, device makers that rely on the FDA's premarket approval process are granted significant protection from legal liability on devices sold in the U.S. This counter-intuitive situation is the result of a confluence of factors, including how the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act from 1938 that established the FDA were written (and further amended), and a series of cases that ran up to the Supreme Court. We estimate a significant proportion of Medtronic's products, including the life-saving Class III products, go through the premarket approval pathway. This also acts to largely limit the size of the settlements to the costs of ensuing medical care for affected patients.Third, Medtronic's device product cycles are relatively short and product defects can often be addressed by the engineers. As a result, new products or even previous-generation products that have demonstrated their safety and efficacy can be marketed fairly quickly, saving some of the lost sales. We've seen this most recently with Medtronic's recall of its 600-series insulin pumps that had a defective retainer ring, but the firm was able to switch over to a different retainer ring as a replacement.","Based on the average volatility of cash flows from a diverse product portfolio in relatively less discretionary therapeutic markets, our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Medtronic is Medium.With baby boomers hitting Medicare age, there could be future cuts to Medicare reimbursement for device-related procedures, which would translate into financial pressure for Medtronic's hospital customers. Innovation is the name of the game in medical devices, but the bar has been raised in the wake of healthcare reform. Successfully securing price premiums for new technology is no longer a given and now depends on favorable clinical data. Increasing regulatory attention and interest in conducting more extensive clinical trials and aftermarket studies could increase development costs for Medtronic. Periodic product recalls and liability and inventory write-downs are occasional sore spots for the industry. Although the U.S. Department of Justice wrapped up its investigation into off-label use of the Infuse product without issuing any charges, the controversy around the investigation added uncertainty and contributed to a decline in Infuse sales during that period. Potential investigations into other products and their marketing remain a risk in the medical-device business.","We reiterate our Standard Capital Allocation Rating for Medtronic. This rating encapsulates our view of sound balance sheet management, fair investment, and appropriate distributions.The firm has whittled down its leverage since its acquisition of Covidien. Based on new CEO Geoff Martha's investment strategy, we think it's unlikely Medtronic will significantly increase debt in pursuit of another large, transformative purchase similar to Covidien. Instead, we anticipate Medtronic will focus on smaller, tuck-in acquisitions of emerging technology, complementary products, and expanding Medtronic's presence in international markets.We give Medtronic positive marks for the choices it has made to invest in programs that solidify its wide economic moat, including developing the MRI-compatible cardiac rhythm devices ahead of competitors, acquiring CoreValve to enhance its presence in the transcatheter aortic valve market, and more recent investments in the Mazor spinal robot , renal denervation, and extravascular implantable defibrillators. Many of its investments in landmark clinical trials have also paid off as Medtronic has successfully expanded indications on its ICDs and CoreValve.However, we give Medtronic demerits for prices paid on its acquisitions. In particular, the purchase of Covidien put a temporary dent in returns on invested capital. Looking forward, we are hopeful that the current management team will be more disciplined on this front. However, we're not yet willing to give them much credit until we see some proof in the pudding.We think Medtronic's distributions have been appropriate. The firm has long set a benchmark of 50% free cash flow distributed to shareholders. In the most recent years, the payout ratio has crept up closer to 70% to 80%. The firm has also raised its dividend for 45 consecutive years. Medtronic also supports a low level of share repurchases, with roughly $6 billion shares remaining on its repurchase authorization. Over the years, the firm has acquired shares that traded both at a discount and a premium to our intrinsive value, making for a neutral effect, from our standpoint.","One of the largest medical-device companies, Medtronic develops and manufactures therapeutic medical devices for chronic diseases. Its portfolio includes pacemakers, defibrillators, heart valves, stents, insulin pumps, spinal fixation devices, neurovascular products, advanced energy, and surgical tools. The company markets its products to healthcare institutions and physicians in the United States and overseas. Foreign sales account for roughly 50% of the company's total sales.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Medtronic is Medium.We are comfortable with Medtronic's financial flexibility. As with other major medical technology competitors, Medtronic occasionally makes large acquisitions that push leverage up, followed by significant deleveraging over the ensuing years as the firm generates considerable cash flow. This dynamic occurred most recently after Medtronic financed a significant portion of the Covidien merger with new debt issuance in 2015. At the end of January 2016, Medtronic owed $36 billion in debt, or close to 5 times adjusted EBITDA, up from around 2 times historically. Since then, the firm has paid off approximately $14 billion of the debt. The firm ended fiscal 2023 with debt/adjusted EBITDA just under 3 times, which is manageable, but slightly higher than what is common in the medical technology industry. Nonetheless, the firm generates strong cash flow that can be put toward tuck-in acquisitions. Beyond its debt obligations and M&A, the firm aims to return a minimum of 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders but has been in the 60% to 70% range in recent years, primarily through its dividend and peripherally due to opportunistic share repurchase.",MDT,Healthcare,106358702080.0,NYQ,5082582.0,USD,78.37000274658203,True,1,78.33517617618587,83.95419735378766,1
24/11/2023,Mizuhos JPY 87 Billion Investment Mitigates Immediate Default Risk but Mobile Still Draining Cash,Rakuten Group Inc,4755,3,13/11/2023,Kazunori Ito,577.9,JPY,24/11/2023,620.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,C,13/11/2023,"Rakuten posted an operating loss of JPY 54.5 billion in the September quarter, largely unchanged from a loss of JPY 48.9 billion in the June quarter. Despite an increase in subscribers to 5.22 million from 4.81 million in the June quarter, operating loss in the mobile segment improved only slightly to JPY 81.2 billion from JPY 82.4 billion. Although we expect the pace of user acquisition to accelerate due to the revision of its incentive plans and increased promotions related to the introduction of the so-called platinum band, which is expected to begin in early 2024, we believe Rakuten Mobiles EBITDA will turn positive in 2026, one year later than the company target, as a result of less room for cost reduction and limited room for average revenue per user growth. We make no changes to our fair value estimate of JPY 620 for Rakuten Group, as we broadly retain our assumptions that mobile losses will gradually shrink and the internet and fintech businesses will maintain healthy growth over the next few years. We think the stock is currently fairly valued. Rakuten plans to achieve positive EBITDA for Rakuten Mobile in 2025 with 8 million-10 million subscribers and JPY 2,500-JPY 3,000 in ARPU, which were 5.22 million and JPY 2,046, respectively, in the September quarter. Rakuten explains that the pace of user acquisition is accelerating as the churn rate declines, with an increase of 192,000 users in October alone, so it may be possible to reach the target of 8 million-10 million subscribers by 2025. However, the bigger hurdle in our view is to increase ARPU to JPY 2,500 from the current JPY 2,046, as heavy users who find Rakutens plans beneficial have already switched to Rakuten Mobile and we expect Rakutens abundant incentives to attract relatively light users in the future. Moreover, we also expect the increase in corporate subscriptions to limit ARPU growth.","Rakutens domestic e-commerce marketplace, Rakuten Ichiba, will defend its leading position.  Rakutens advertising revenue will be boosted by better algorithms for target marketing and new advertisement inventory. Rakutens fintech business will see continuous margin expansion from operating leverage. ","Amazon Japan and other local e-commerce players continue to compete aggressively.  Rakuten needs to write off more goodwill for its overseas investment.  Rakuten Card and its mobile payment will see challenges from newcomers, such as Yahoo Card and Line Card.",13/11/2023,"Rakuten, the earliest and largest business-to-business-to-customer e-commerce platform, has benefited from the structural shift from offline to online shopping in Japan.  Rakutens business model of combining e-commerce and fintech has helped the company build up a network effect, with about 36 million monthly active users and 26 million Rakuten Card holders. The company has been building up a one-stop platformnot only for shopping, but also for financial services, entertainment and telecommunications. Rakuten Points, one of the largest points programmes in Japan, has promoted cross-use of Rakuten services. The cross-use ratio of more than two Rakuten services is at a high level of about 74.8% by the end of the March quarter in 2022. Although competition in the Japanese e-commerce market has intensified, we believe Rakuten Ichiba will maintain its user base, leveraging the ecosystem. Rakuten's points system is also effective in promoting cross-use of services. In 2021, JPY 530 billion points were issued and over 90% of points were being used on different Rakuten platforms. As such, the e-commerce and fintech businesses have been able to bring in steady income for the company, and maintain a high operating margin of around 13% and 15% in the past five years. However, Rakuten Group's profitability has declined significantly in the past three years due to their loss-making new mobile business. In 2020, Rakuten launched its very own mobile network service, and has acquired over 5 million users by April 2022. We estimate that Rakuten mobile has about 2% of Japan's telecommunications market share currently. The business has not been profitable since its launch, due to heavy initial investments, roaming costs, and promotion costs. Nevertheless, with further expansion in population coverage, we expect Rakuten mobile to acquire about 5% of market share by 2026, and gradually improve its profitability in the midterm.","We assign Rakuten a narrow moat rating, based on network effect and intangible assets in the domestic market. Rakuten is not only the top e-commerce provider, but is also one of the top e-finance service providers in Japan, constituting a comprehensive ecosystem, in which users of one service can benefit from other services provided by the same company. We believe Rakutens economic moat, which protects its future cash flow from competitors, is derived from this unique position.We think Rakutens e-commerce business is the core source of its network effect. Rakuten Ichiba, established in 1997, is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Japan, sharing market leadership with Amazon Japan. Yahoo Japan follows in third position, with 9% market share. Rakutens business model is that of managing an online shopping mall, which provides an e-commerce platform for merchants. Under this business model, we identify a strong network effect, as merchants prefer to display their products on a larger e-commerce platform that provides more business opportunities, and users gravitate to larger platforms that offer a wider mix of merchandise. Rakutens network effect is reinforced by other services, such as Rakuten Travel (online travel agency), Rakuten Card (credit card), Rakuten Securities (online brokerage), Rakuten Life, and Rakuten Mobile (mobile network operator). We believe its unique business model of combining e-commerce and e-finance has helped to enhance the firms network effect. For instance, Rakuten users gain Rakuten Super Points from online shopping, and they can use earned points for other services, such as traveling and online trading. Rakuten grants twice as much Rakuten Points when customers pay using the Rakuten Card within its ecosystem, which incentivizes users to stay inside Rakutens ecosystem. Each of the services has substantial market share. Rakuten Travels market share in online travel agents is 21%; Rakuten Cards market share in credit cards is 9%; Rakuten Securities market share in online brokerage firms is 15%; and Rakuten Mobiles share in mobile virtual network operators is 26%. While Rakuten has competitors in each of its businesses, no other company can provide an established comprehensive ecosystem to users. More than 50% of Rakutens gross merchandise value is paid by customers using the Rakuten Card, and 73% of its active users use Rakuten points on multiple services. We think these numbers imply the strength of Rakutens entire ecosystem.Rakutens intangible assets comprise accumulated user data and its strong brand name in Japan. Operating the largest e-commerce business in Japan, Rakuten has been acquiring and storing user activity data for more than 20 years, which is useful for target marketing. We think new entrants are unable to easily compete with Rakuten, as it can leverage its data to suggest other products, display adverts that attract users, and send marketing emails; these actions may further stimulate users buying intentions. As accumulated data is hard to replicate for new entrants, we believe it will work as an economic moat. Throughout its 20-year history, Rakuten has focused on improving its brand name to establish a solid user base in Japan; we think its acquisition of one of the 12 professional baseball teams in 2004 (Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles), pushing up its ranking from 167th in 2003 to 32nd in 2004, contributed significantly to this.Meanwhile, we do not believe that Rakutens overseas business has an economic moat. Rakuten has built up a solid brand name and ecosystem in Japan by leveraging its position as the first online shopping mall, and we acknowledge that it has been accelerating its merger and acquisition activity to replicate its success overseas. The firm bought PriceMinister in 2010, Kobo in 2012, Viki in 2013, Viber and Ebates in 2014, and OverDrive in 2015. However, while Ebates has been profitable, we estimate that most of the other businesses are struggling because of the tough competition, and the company had to file an impairment loss of goodwill for two consecutive years.","We assign Rakuten a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. We believe that the biggest risk in the short term for Rakuten stems from the intense competition in e-commerce in Japan. Amazon Japan has been catching up rapidly in recent years. In addition to promoting its Prime membership, it has added to its content services in Japan, such as video streaming. Rakuten operates one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Japan, and in addition, possesses one of the leading credit card, online securities, and online banking subsidiaries, with over 120 million active IDs. That said, Rakuten is managing not only the transaction data of online shopping but also the credit card data and users asset data in one place. We do not think this is a material risk to Rakuten as the company has never recorded a data breach before, but we note that it could pose a serious issue to Rakuten. Since the launch of the mobile network operator, or MNO, business in April 2020, Rakuten has experienced several connection issues, due to the lack of experience and sufficient network coverage area. Meanwhile, Rakuten reported that the number of Rakuten Mobile subscribers reached 5 million (including mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, subscribers) in August 2021. We believe that Rakutens MNO business made a decent launch, but we need to keep a close eye on it, as repeated connection issues may lead to reputation risks.","Based on our framework, we assign Rakuten a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. Although we are concerned about the massive investment required for the mobile business in the short term, we think that the business will contribute to enhancing Rakutens economic moat in the longer term. In addition to the current combination of the e-commerce and the fintech businesses, we expect the mobile business will add more stickiness to Rakutens entire ecosystem and contribute increasing revenue per Rakuten user.Rakuten officially started the mobile network operator, or MNO, service in April 2020. As Rakuten needs to build its own nationwide network, capital expenditure for base stations will be necessary. At the same time, the company must pay a roaming fee as Rakuten has to rely on KDDIs network until it establishes its own nationwide network. That said, Rakuten will suffer from both the capital expenditure for base stations and roaming fee to KDDI for the meantime. Rakutens original plan was to use JPY 600 billion as capital expenditure to cover 96% of the population with 27,397 base stations by March 2026. While the company has raised the number of base stations to 44,000, the target date has been moved up significantly to the end of 2021. Consequently, Rakuten estimates that the total capital expenditure will increase by 30%-40%, and thus the company raised JPY 240 billion in March 2021 by the third-party allotment. We forecast that fiscal 2021 will be the peak of the loss of the segment as both capital expenditure and roaming fee payment will start to decline from 2022.Rakutens dividends have been unchanged over the past seven years. Similar to other internet companies, Rakuten has been focusing its resources to expand its ecosystem and therefore the dividend payout ratio has been low. We believe this policy is well understood by investors.","Rakuten is a leading e-commerce and fintech service provider in Japan. It has built up a comprehensive Rakuten ecosystem in Japan, including Rakuten Ichiba for e-commerce, Rakuten Travel, Rakuten Card, Rakuten Bank, Rakuten Securities, and decided to become the fourth mobile network operator in Japan, started its full service in April 2020. Mergers and acquisitions in internet and e-finance businesses have driven growth. The loyalty programme, Rakuten Super Points, has encouraged cross-use of services in its ecosystem. About 80% of revenue is generated from the Japanese market and the firm has been scaling back its unprofitable overseas business.","Recently, Rakutens strategy has involved the pursuit of growth in overseas markets, and accelerated M&A activities. Rich cash flow from the e-commerce business and bank loans were the major resources for acquisitions, and as a result debt of the parent company increased from JPY 1 trillion in 2017 to JPY 3.4 trillion in 2021. Still, we consider the parent companys balance sheet to be healthy, with a debt/equity ratio of 0.9 times. We focus on the parent company to exclude the impact of financial subsidiaries.Meanwhile, impairments from unprofitable businesses are becoming a short-term risk. Although the fintech business operating margins have stood steadily at 22%-23%, the impairment loss has dragged down the overall margin. The company booked an impairment loss of JPY 53.2 billion in the past two years, including JPY 17.2 billion for PriceMinister and JPY 7.8 billion for Kobo. We are concerned that other international investments, such as Viber, are not profitable, and hence that the firm is exposed to further impairment risk. However, we do not see this as critical, as we assess that more than half of the goodwill does not have an impairment risk, and total goodwill (JPY 358 billion) is less than shareholders equity (JPY 680 billion).Rakuten has suggested that it will use bank loans to finance the capital expenditure for the MNO business, and that debt will peak at JPY 600 billion by 2025, which may lift the parent companys debt/equity ratio to 1.8 from 0.9. The total investment will be JPY 600 billion-900 billion over seven years, depending on how much the company will use from its own cash flow. In any case, we are concerned that this is insufficient to establish its own network from scratch, and that further investment may be necessary. Over the past three years, NTT Docomo has invested JPY 1.8 trillion, KDDI has invested JPY 1 trillion, and Softbank has invested JPY 1.2 trillion, suggesting that Rakutens plan might be optimistic.",4755.T,Consumer Cyclical,1209495453696.0,JPX,13265600.0,JPY,577.9000244140625,True,1,571.169511004194,675.6759489035217,1
24/11/2023,2024 Begins the Next Phase in L3Harris' Emergence as a Prime Defense Contractor,L3Harris Technologies Inc,LHX,4,29/10/2023,Nicolas Owens,187.83,USD,23/11/2023,230.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,29/10/2023,"With L3Harris' third-quarter results in hand, we have raised our fair value estimate for the narrow-moat defense contractor by just over 1% to $230 to account for the time value of money. Year to date, the company reported steady growth across its segments, with segment operating margins over 14%, which bodes well for future quarters if the company can fulfill its multiple post-merger plans to increase margins further. The company is the result of a series of strategic mergers, like most of its larger ""prime"" defense contracting peers, but it is a bit earlier in its evolution by comparison. The company announced that 2024 would begin the next phase of its merger integration between L3 Technologies and Harris, itself consummated in 2019referring to this as the hard work beyond finding obvious cost overlaps to finding ways for its teams to work together on projects they might not have been able to pursue as well if they weren't part of the same company. We believe this will credibly result in some opportunity, reflected in our long-term revenue and profit forecast. In 2023, the firm completed the acquisition of ViaSat's data link networking business, as well as the more transformative Aerojet Rocketdyne, which supplies rocket motors and munitions to the defense and aerospace industry. Aerojet Rocketdyne has suffered recently from supply chain bottlenecks as many inputs for rockets are rare and may come from only one or two specialized suppliers. Its products are in sharp demand as global stockpiles of munitions, missiles, and rockets are depleted and restocked as a result of military conflicts in Ukraine, Israel, and elsewhere. Inclusion in the L3Harris portfolio should help with the supply chain as the larger firm has the people and resources to send to suppliers (and their suppliers) to work through bottlenecks.","L3Harris' strategy to position itself as the ""sixth prime"" U.S. defense contractor could offer growth potential if it is able to bid for programs it could not take on as a smaller and more specialized contractor. L3Harris is at the base of a global replacement cycle for tactical radios, which we think will drive substantial growth. Defense contractors operate in an acyclical business, which could offer some protection if the U.S. enters a recession.","L3Harris depends on U.S. military funding, which is an inherently political and thus uncertain process.  We expect that, for better or worse, L3Harris top line will be more reactive to changes in defense spending than longer-cycle peers. L3Harris recent acquisitions may distract management and have attracted regulatory scrutiny.",29/10/2023,"L3Harris Technologies is the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor by sales (13th globally, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). It formed in 2019 from the merger of L-3 Technologies, a sensormaker that operated a decentralized business focused on inorganic growth, and the Harris Corporation, a sensor and radio manufacturer that ran a more unified business. Underpinning the merger was an assumption that additional scale would primarily generate cost synergies and eventually, the firms could produce meaningful revenue synergies. With the recent addition of ViaSat's tactical data link business and most recently the $4.7 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris has opportunistically vaulted its strategy forward into becoming a more well-rounded defense prime contractor, adding munitions, space exploration, and hypersonic missile components and capabilities to its very radio- and communications-heavy base. That said, Aerojet supplies components to many other defense contractors, which isn't likely to change, and competes with the space segment of Northrop Grumman. We think it will take time for meaningful revenue synergies that weren't already in the backlog for L3Harris, ViaSat, or Aerojet to materialize. The defense budget allocation is a political process, which is inherently difficult to predict, so we favor companies with tangible growth profiles through a steady stream of contract wins, ideally to contracts that are fulfilled over decades. While many of L3Harris' products are replenished over a short- to medium-term timespan (in defense-industry context: years, not decades), many of these are integrated with long-lived platforms such as fighters and ships, where L3Harris has some incumbency advantage in rebidding for the next upgrade or refit. The Aerojet acquisition stands to augment this effect, simply in terms of the long duration of some of the programs it supplies motors and components for. The three biggest organic growth opportunities we see for L3Harris Technologies are the tactical radios replacement cycle, national security satellite asset decentralization, and international sales expansion.","The durability of economic profits in the defense sector may seem paradoxical: large defense contractors invest billions of dollars to generate products on the cutting edge of technology, and unit pricing for their products declines over time. What's more, these companies primarily sell to a single buyer (referred to as a monopsony in economic textbooks; in this case, it's the procurement arm of the U.S. Defense Department) with rapidly evolving needs, a tendency to change product requirements, and intermittent and sometimes politicized squabbles over paying the bill. The U.S. Defense Department counts tens of thousands of contractors among its suppliers, many of them small businesses, and any of these contracting directly with the government (itself a kind of intangible skill set) are referred to as ""prime contractors"" (sort of like the general contractor on a construction project) that routinely source from smaller subcontractors, suppliers, and one another for portions of the systems they design and deliver. Nonetheless, we observe that wide moats are prevalent at the large end of the defense contracting business. These durable competitive advantages exist because of significant intangible assets: first among these is the extreme product complexity that thwarts new entrants, bolstered by decadeslong product cycles, contract structures that reduce risk for incumbents and lock out alternative suppliers, as well as the switching costs of a risk-averse customer facing significant time and risk to potentially switch products or suppliers.We believe that intangible assets in the defense industry ensure that incumbent firms are the only companies capable of servicing the militarys large need to purchase arms (broadly defined), which manifests as a material barrier to entry. In terms of keeping competition at bay, we believe the primary source of intangible assets is product complexity. First, the technology used in arms production requires extensive and specialized expertise that also usually lacks commercial viability outside of the defense industry (aside from commercial aerospace manufacturing), so a new entrant would likely need to develop this know-how entirely from the ground up or acquire it outright, and we observe only a few capable incumbents in each major category of defense systems development. Second, the development of a military program is long and expensive; a would-be competitor would face material sunk costs ranging from the challenge of developing a workforce that has the required experience and/or security clearances to enter the space to the time and money spent developing a prototype to pitch for a contract. We note that the only serious outside threat to a small subsegment of this business, space launches, are the pet projects of multibillionaires. We use the Stockholm International Peace Research Institutes dataset on the arms industry as evidence that the arms production industry is insulated from outside competition: Lockheed Martin, along with Boeings defense unit, BAE Systems, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, and General Dynamics have remained the top six or seven global arms producers for the past 15 years (a Chinese state-owned enterprise is the seventh in some of those years).The second major intangible asset in the defense industry is the contract structure that allows excess return generation. Generally, defense prime contractors compete fiercely within initial bidding rounds to win contracts to design and develop a prototype for a new program. The government then usually selects one or more of the winning prototype bidders to deliver a small number of testable products, after which the winning prime contractor is awarded a low-rate initial production contract, followed by full-rate production and eventually sustainment business. After the original round of purchasing is completed, it is quite rare to see a government switch contractors. During the early stages of development and production, the government generally purchases using cost-plus contracts, which shift the financial burden of cost overruns to the customer, but the potential profit is lower. Given the immense risk of cost overruns in designing complex products such as bomber aircraft, this dynamic frequently works in the contractors favor. As programs age to the production phase, they tend to move toward fixed-price contracts, often split into phases or lots, where the unit economics evolve over time as production can be scaled up for a successful program. Although fixed-price contracts carry more financial risk because the burden of cost overruns rests on the contractor, they tend to be more profitable because manufacturing costs become better understood and can even decline significantly as a program ages and delivery volumes increase. Considering the opportunity for additional revenue and profits from maintenance of delivered weapons systems (""sustainment"" in the military contracting parlance), these mature program contracts often become long-standing cash cows because program life cycles can last decades.Switching costs for the military customer are generally predicated on the mission-criticality of the product, extended product cycles, a lack of viable alternative products, and the substantial time investment or risk involved in switching suppliers. The major products for U.S.-based defense contractors include military vehicles (including land, air, and sea-based vehicles), intelligence-gathering and communication systems, radars and sensors, and munitions. The ability for a military to succeed at its strategic objectives and defeat an adversary, as well as protecting the lives of soldiers and civilians, is contingent on these products working as intended, which we think protects the proven suppliers from upstart competition. Product cycles are a source of differentiation. We view the products with the longest procurement cycles, such as fighter jets and submarines, as the moatiest because contracts with decades-long fulfillments provide extraordinarily long-term revenue and profit visibility. We see short-cycle products, such as defense IT contracting, less favorably. As contracts for defense hardware essentially grant a monopoly over that product, we also see some modest switching costs stemming from a lack of viable alternatives, but this is partially mitigated by the governments right to license patents to third parties as well as the fact that product cycles for similar systems often overlap and may be provided by competing suppliers. More important to us is the extensive investment required to replicate a product that fulfills a mission. Product development in this industry ranges from years to decades, and if the military is dissatisfied with the product, it is much faster and easier to work with the existing contractor to fix it than to fund the development of a brand-new program to replace it. Following this framework, in which we view the moatiest segments as those with the most difficult-to-replicate products with the longest production and upgrade cycles, we give a narrow moat to L3Harris Technologies. We think that L3Harris Technologies benefits more from the switching costs related to the programs it deploys with customers than the inherent complexity of the development of very-long-cycle systems, which L3Harris provides integrations with but does not primarily design and manufacture like its larger competitors. L3Harris has built or acquired an enviable portfolio of communications, intelligence gathering, and avionics products, and we anticipate that the firm is more likely than not to continue earning excess returns. We constrain our moat rating to narrow, unlike several peer contractors, as its returns on invested capital are not as strong as peers and because we think the complexity-based intangible assets are less strong than peers. We also view the shorter-cycle nature of the firms portfolio less favorably. Much of the firms stand-alone products are low-price, higher volume products, and are thus more reactive to changes in the funding environment. We view L3Harris sensitivity to the overall budget less favorably than for products with long-term revenue visibility on platform products. The firm derives about 63% of its revenue as a prime contractor. While many of the firms C4ISR products are well integrated into longer-cycle products, some avionics and components are updated occasionally, which we view less favorably than prime contracts that seldom switch.Across all three of its business segments, though to somewhat varying degrees, we see L3Harris benefiting from product complexity-based intangible assets and switching costs stemming from mission criticality as well as placement of its products on longer-cycle platforms.Within integrated mission systems, the firm produces and maintains a diverse set of sensors and control systems within various military vehicles, ships, and aircraft as well as uncrewed underwater vehicles, or UUVs. These sensors are used for surveillance, targeting, and interfleet communication. We think L3Harris benefits from barriers to entry from the extensive expertise required to produce these high-end sensors and UUVs, and we anticipate that the lack of commercial viability outside of the defense industry keeps would-be competitors out of the industry. We see switching costs in the form of integration on longer-cycle and more-complex products, and we think the firm benefits from razor-and-blade dynamics with the aftermarket. The firm maintains the communications systems for attack submarines and ships that have decadeslong useful lives and are unlikely to change their communication systems to save on sensor maintenance.Within space and airborne systems, we see complexity-based barriers to entry on the advanced sensors and jammers. While we think many companies are capable of creating high-level sensors, only a few can produce military-grade sensors that are designed to operate despite adversaries best efforts to jam and disrupt them. Many of the firms contracts are classified in this segment, which further increases the barrier to entry. We see switching costs stemming from placement on more complex products. While most of the time, complex manufacturing processes mean that firms do not compete much once a product is integrated onto a platform, there are some instances of recompetes. F-35s Block 4 purchase included a dramatic upgrade to the cockpit and computers powering the aircraft. L3Harris won additional content on the F-35 from this upgrade, but we view the fact that the components were recompeted in the first place as indicative of less favorable business dynamics in comparison to the wide-moat defense contractors we cover. There is material technical know-how protecting these products from competition, but we believe switching costs are the more powerful moat source in this segment. The firm has managed the FAAs communications infrastructure for 25 years, and there is a substantial cost of failure if the customer switched to a product that didnt operate as intended. The communication system must also be secure as it manages defense facilities communications. We do not expect that aircraft manufacturers will choose untested suppliers for avionics that avoid collision due to the lethal cost of failure and the wide publication of aviation failures.Within communication systems, the firm produces military-grade encrypted radios and broadband communication equipment and has product placement on a variety of aircraft, ships, and other vehicles. We see some modest complexity-based intangible assets. While plenty of firms can create radios and broadband networks, far fewer can provide sufficient speed, encryption, and can operate properly despite adversary attempts to jam communication. We see the mission criticality of the product as the primary switching cost. As product failure can be lethal or lead to highly embarrassing fiascos, we expect that the military would be unwilling to switch to an untested supplier. The firm has a large and well-understood installed base, which means that the firm can upgrade products with minimal additional training from the government, which we think increases costs.","The major risks we see for L3Harris are geopolitical risks relating to the defense budgeting and sales process and execution risk related in part to the firm's recent spate of mergers & acquisitions. We assign a medium uncertainty rating to the stock.Although U.S. defense spending has risen recently, as has that of allied partners, the risk always remains that defense budgets get caught up in political wrangling; even if the money eventually gets approved, the Defense Department cannot spend it until that happens, which can hamper contractors' ability to plan and execute on existing contracts.L3Harris faces general execution risk related to delivering on its contracts. Supply chain issues and production challenges could continue to prevent it from meeting deadlines or other contractual obligations, affecting costs and putting L3Harris' customer relationships under strain. While fixed-price contracts are generally reserved for more mature programs that have well-understood costs, the contractor bears the financial risk of cost overruns for such programs, so a poorly executed development program could also harm the company financially. These execution risks are exacerbated by the company's recent series of acquisitions; itself the product of a combination of L3 and Harris, integrating sizable businesses like ViaSat's tactical data business and Aerojet Rocketdyne can distract management and increase the likelihood for surprises or misjudgments on pricing, staffing, and other execution fronts.We see moderate ESG risk to the firm from the nature of the company's business model. The company is a defense contractor that produces cutting edge technology for military purposes. We think there is a risk that the company would be unable to find sufficient human capital to continue designing high-quality products. A data breach may release substantial confidential information, which may in turn make it more difficult for the company to win new contracts.","We assign L3Harris Technologies a Standard capital allocation rating. This assessment is based on a sound balance sheet rating, a fair investments rating, and an appropriate shareholder distributions rating. The firm has a sound balance sheet, in our view. L3Harris' net debt was just shy of 3 turns of EBITDA at the end of 2022. We're expecting net debt will be less than 2.0 turns of EBITDA over our forecast period, even after the integration of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The firm's debt maturity schedule is spread out enough that we don't see meaningful refinancing risk.We think the firm's investments have been fair. The foundation of its strategy is to use the increased scale and centralization from the merger of equals between L3 and the Harris Corporation to produce a better cost structure and improve efficiency. While the firm achieved its synergy targets from that combination so far, it has also embarked on two sizable and potentially strategic deals: ViaSat's tactical data business, and the takeover of Aerojet Rocktdyne. Time will tell if execution on both deals results in increased returns on invested capital.We think the firm's shareholder distributions have been appropriate. It divested a sizable portion of noncore L3 assets in 2020 and 2021 and used the proceeds for share repurchases. Management intends to use a large proportion of free cash flow for share repurchases going forward. The firm has stated that it intends to refinance, rather than repay, much of its debt so that it can focus on repurchases. We think this is sensible for an acyclical defense contractor with a well-funded pension like L3Harris. That noted, while we understand the market rewards firms that pay shareholders, we would be more comfortable applying a lower cost of equity to the firm if it had less debt, so we think the firm could increase its intrinsic value by paying down debt.","L3Harris Technologies provides products for the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or C4ISR, market. The firm produces uncrewed aerial vehicles, sensors, and avionics, as well as provides military and commercial training services and maintains the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's communications infrastructure. In July 2023, the company acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne, a key supplier of rocket motors to the space and defense industry.","We think L3Harris is in solid financial shape. We project a 2023 gross debt/EBITDA of roughly 3.0 times, including the Aerojet Rocketdyne deal and related debt issuance. Between 2019 and 2022, while its indebtedness hovered around $7 billion, the company returned over $11 billion to investors in the form of share repurchases ($8.3 billion) and dividends ($3 billion), augmented by about $4.3 billion in proceeds from portfolio divestitures. In 2023 L3Harris issued just over $3 billion of new notes to finance most of the Aerojet acquisition. We're anticipating EBTIDA expansion will be the driving force behind any decreasing debt/EBITDA ratio over our forecast period.L3Harris produces a substantial amount of free cash flow and is not especially indebted, so we anticipate that the company would be able to access the capital markets to refinance debt or fund its next acquisition at minimal cost if necessary. Management has indicated that ViaSat and Aerojet Rocketdyne are likely its last deals for a few years.",LHX,Industrials,36901543936.0,NYQ,1109921.0,USD,187.8300018310547,True,1,178.9241178624753,207.30000003767532,1
25/11/2023,DaVita's Long-Term Outlook Challenged by Obesity Drug Expansion,DaVita Inc,DVA,3,08/11/2023,Julie Utterback,99.48,USD,23/11/2023,104.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,08/11/2023,"Narrow-moat DaVita turned in strong third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, and management increased its 2023 guidance for the third time this year. We are keeping our $104 fair value estimate intact, but recognize the firm's strong trends on the top and bottom lines, which may be enhanced by management's plans to resume its share repurchase program. We think repurchases would be a good use of capital considering recent trades well below intrinsic value and the firm's leverage in the middle of its target range. In the quarter, DaVita fared better than anticipated as external challenges eased and the firm controlled costs well. For example, COVID-19 mortality challenges appear to be dissipating in the dialysis market, as the pandemic turns into an endemic situation. With that easing, sales in the quarter grew 6% year over year, including about flat treatments and revenue per treatment up 3% in the U.S. DaVita's cost controls really stood out in the quarter, as the company reduced both its patient care costs (on the switch to Mircera drug costs for anemia management and reduced labor pressures,) and general and administrative costs per treatment. In total, U.S. operating profit per treatment grew 29% year over year by our calculations, which looked strong in that mature market, and overall, DaVita's adjusted EPS nearly doubled to $2.85 in the period, or well above FactSet consensus of $2.01. On these stellar trends, DaVita increased its 2023 guidance again. Now, management expects a 22% increase in adjusted EPS at the midpoint of its new guidance range of $7.80-$8.30 (from $7.00 to $7.80 previously). Also, the company increased its free cash flow estimate to $950 million to $1.15 billion, up from $850 million to $1.1 billion previously. Overall, we appreciate that DaVita's near-term challenges appear to be easing a bit after a tough pandemic period, but our fair value estimate has not changed materially, despite mild changes to our near-term expectations.","Excluding recent COVID-19 mortality challenges and obesity drug expansion, the ESRD patient population may grow at a healthy rate in the U.S. and around the globe for the long run, which should benefit DaVita. DaVita enjoys top-tier status in the essential dialysis business, and we do not expect competitive dynamics to negatively affect that attractive position anytime soon. While growing at-home care could change its business model a bit, DaVita could also benefit from ESRD patients being able to continue working and staying on commercial insurance plans.","Potential U.S. healthcare policy changes could reduce industry profitability if insurance coverage shifts away from employer-based plans and if Medicare reimbursement rates aren't changed significantly. DaVita's high financial leverage creates significant fixed obligations that could weigh on the stock, especially if profitability declines. If technology is introduced that makes dialysis unnecessary in the long run, such as obesity drugs, demand for its services may decline permanently.",11/10/2023,"After selling the DaVita Medical Group in 2019, DaVita focuses almost exclusively on providing services to end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, patients primarily in the United States with an expanding international footprint. Over several decades, DaVita has built the largest network of dialysis clinics in the U.S., and although COVID-19-related mortality and labor pressures cut into DaVita's profits in recent years, we see brighter days ahead for DaVita, despite some challenges emerging on the obesity drug front. Once COVID-19 concerns dissipate, we would expect DaVita to get back to more normalized growth trends driven primarily by ESRD trends. We think low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth is likely for DaVita in the long run based on the continued expansion of the U.S. dialysis patient population, mild revenue per treatment growth, and ongoing international expansion. These expectations include ongoing expansion of at-home treatments, and we think DaVita can even benefit from extending the at-home treatment stage for patients, despite its clinic infrastructure. At-home patients still have relationships with clinics and are more likely to continue working and, in turn, remain on more profitable commercial insurance plans for a more substantial part of the 33 months where that is possible before Medicare automatically takes the lead on reimbursement for ESRD treatments. Eventually, most ESRD patients will need in-clinic therapy, too, unless they receive a kidney transplant. Of note, supply and demand for transplants remain greatly mismatched with the average wait list time around four years. But if those dynamics change, DaVita may even be able to benefit, as it has invested in early-stage initiatives to improve transplants. And in general, we think DaVita stands to benefit from the continued growth in the ESRD population however they are treated, and it is even pursuing integrated care models to gain a bigger piece of the treatment pie in the long run.  With these factors in mind, we expect low- to mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit operating income growth that could be further expanded on the adjusted EPS line by share repurchases through 2027.","DaVita has dug a narrow moat in dialysis services, operating the most clinics in the United States. We believe the companys competitive advantages in this business should help it generate returns on invested capital including goodwill in the low double digits on average throughout our explicit 10-year forecast period, or moderately above its capital costs. At DaVita, we see intangible assets and scale-related cost advantages as the firm's moat sources. In terms of intangible assets, DaVita has built the largest network of dialysis clinics in the U.S. over several decades, based in part on its brand and reputation for high-quality services, extensive physician relationships, and convenient locations, which all influence the lifeblood of its businessreferrals from nephrologists. The firms reputation for quality remains especially important, and DaVita continues to deliver high-quality metrics in this essential niche of the healthcare service sector. Transparency around clinic quality appears strong with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rating clinics in the U.S. by care quality and patient survey results, which can be easily accessed by potential users. While one may argue that smaller clinics could deliver similar service quality, the data suggests that the other U.S. clinics are having a tough time replicating the service quality that DaVita and Fresenius regularly demonstrate. For example, the top two players in this niche score better on clinic quality than the other franchises on average when judging by a variety of factors, including hospitalizations, mortality rates, bloodstream infections, and waste removal. This consistent care quality influences doctor referrals, and DaVita recently estimated that it has referral relationships with about 70% of the practicing nephrologists in the U.S. These quality ratings also influence penalties that CMS imposes on underperforming facilities, and DaVita and Fresenius both avoid these penalties at a higher rate than other clinics based on the quality of their service offerings. We think aspects of DaVitas relationships with referring nephrologists provide intangible assets, as well. For example, some referring physicians have ownership stakes in the clinics that DaVita operates. Specifically, about 28% of DaVitas U.S. dialysis revenue in 2021 came from such joint venture arrangements. We believe these arrangements give partial owners incentive to refer patients to those specific clinics, which is a significant intangible asset, in our opinion. Also, each clinic employs a medical director, consisting of a nephrologist or nephrologist group, that can refer to dialysis clinics and receives compensation from DaVita for providing medical program guidance and other administrative functions. While DaVita denies that any referring physician is required to send patients to a specific clinic, we believe natural financial incentives, perceived quality based on influence at certain clinics, and other loyalties can influence a physicians clinic recommendation when helping determine a patients care plan. Additionally, DaVitas widespread clinic locations can offer patients convenience that is particularly important when considering where to regularly receive these typically time-intensive treatments. In-clinic dialysis patients receive treatment for three to four hours per day, three times per week for the rest of their lives or until they get a successful kidney transplant. Considering that grueling schedule for an already very sick patient, additional commute time to and from the treatment facility remains a major point of concern when physicians and patients determine individual treatment plans. Therefore, DaVita takes care to locate its clinics in convenient areas to serve ESRD patients efficiently. Also, we see a mild switching cost related to convenient locations because once a patient is slotted into a shift at a high-quality and convenient dialysis center, patients would have little incentive to leave that facility or care team, although we see this switching cost as only supportive of the moat rather than a moat source for the company.Beyond those intangible assets, we think scale-related factors lead to cost advantages and negotiating power with key payers that help DaVita generate economic profits. On the most basic level, todays dialysis service industry embodies how third-party payers reward using cheaper outpatient facilities (dialysis clinics) rather than an acute care setting (hospitals) to lower the cost of treating chronically ill patients. In healthcare, outpatient facilities typically enjoy much lower overhead costs than their hospital peers and can be reimbursed by payers at lower rates because of that fundamental cost advantage. For example, receiving an emergency dialysis treatment in an acute care hospital would cost many multiples of what a scheduled outpatient treatment would cost (around $359 on average per treatment at DaVita in 2021), and third-party payers have incentive to drive ESRD patients to that cheaper outpatient alternative for care on a regular basis. Additionally, we think both top-tier dialysis service providers enjoy scale-related advantages relative to their healthcare service and even dialysis clinic peers where DaVita and Fresenius operate at similar scales and cumulatively treat about 75% of outpatient dialysis patients in the U.S. This scale-related advantage contributes to pricing power against commercial insurers. While we do not think the negotiating position of DaVita is substantially different than Fresenius given their similar market positions, we think both players enjoy stronger negotiating positions than the average U.S. healthcare service provider versus commercial health insurers. This differential is especially important in dialysis services since nearly all of the industrys profits are derived from commercial insurers, and the dialysis industry's concentration appears much stronger than other major healthcare systems in the U.S. For example, the top 10 hospitals claim only about 15% of the hospital market and the top independent reference labs (narrow-moat LabCorp and Quest) cumulatively claim less than 25% of the lab services market. This scale difference appears to give DaVita and Fresenius a much stronger negotiating position relative to commercial insurers than the average U.S. caregiver. For example on the average dialysis treatment, commercial insurers pay DaVita about 4 times what the government would pay for a dialysis treatment, and that differential is substantially higher than what the average healthcare service provider can garner from a commercial insurer versus Medicare, which is roughly 2 times. This scale-related pricing power directly affects DaVitas ability to generate economic returns in our opinion, and from a commercial payer negotiation perspective, we view the dialysis industry as stronger than the narrow moat reference lab industry and much stronger than the hospital space, which we generally view as a no-moat industry with some exceptions, such as narrow-moat HCA. Relative to other dialysis clinics, we see scale-related cost advantages at DaVita and Fresenius, too. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPac, has identified higher volume dialysis facilities as having a cost-per-treatment advantage based on direct reports from individual clinics. Based on the treatments per facility, we think DaVita and Fresenius benefit from a mild cost advantage over their smaller dialysis clinic peers. We think these cost advantages are influenced by internal efficiencies probably related to the experience and standardization of its operations. For example, the average DaVita and Fresenius clinic in the U.S. operates with higher potential capacity, higher utilization, and fewer full-time employees than their smaller peers. Additionally, we believe DaVita and Fresenius have more negotiating leverage for major treatment inputs, including pharmaceuticals and supplies, than smaller clinics, and they can spread general and administrative costs over a larger base of clinics than smaller clinics, as well. All of these factors help reduce the overall cost per treatment at the top-tier players relative to smaller-scale peers, which helps the top-tier players generate economic profits.","After the U.S. Supreme Court offered a surprising decision in the case of Marietta Memorial Hospital Employee Health Benefit Plan versus DaVita, we raised our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for DaVita to High from Medium, since this decision could allow employers to push outpatient dialysis services out of network for employees, including dialysis patients. Although limited negative consequences have emerged so far, we suspect such a shift, if unchecked by a statutory language change by Congress for example, could create a significant financial burden on the roughly 10% of U.S. dialysis patients that currently receive treatment through commercial insurance plans and represent the vast majority of U.S. dialysis service-related profits. That could negatively affect cash flows at DaVita substantially if these patients switch over to the secondary payer option (Medicare) from commercial plans more quickly without any significant offsets like Medicare raising rates. We also see some uncertainty around efforts to treat more ESRD patients at home. Positively, the need for dialysis clinics will not evaporate in that scenario since at-home patients need to be trained and monitored even if they don't receive treatment in the clinic. However, we recognize that one of the firm's major intangible assets (convenient locations) may become less important, which could eventually affect profitability. In the very long term, new drug or technology threats, such as regenerative medicine or other technology developments that eliminate the need for dialysis, could emerge and disrupt the DaVita business model. For example, as obesity drugs expand with their potential to slow disease progression, the incidence rate of dialysis may eventually decline. ","Our Capital Allocation Rating for DaVita remains Standard, although we think it scores weakly in the category with a weak balance sheet, fair investments, and mixed shareholder distributions.DaVita's fair investments are the most influential part of the company's Standard capital allocation rating, and the company's purchase of HealthCare Partners in 2012, in particular, weighs on our view of this scoring component. First, this acquisition cut into the firm's returns on invested capital including goodwill for an extended period. Prior to that transaction, DaVita's ROICs stood in the low double digits. Directly after that deal, ROICs declined by about 200 basis points, and subsequent problems, including goodwill and intangible impairments, cut even further into ROICs. While DaVita's ROICs returned to pre-deal levels briefly in 2020, COVID-19 and other challenges may keep the company from returning to those levels for another five years. The firm's top-tier position in dialysis services is so strong that ROICs have remained above WACC since the acquisition and are estimated to stay above WACC during the next 10 years. But DaVita's previous management team's decision to stray from its core competency in dialysis services appears to have narrowed the firm's moat a bit, in our opinion. In the future, we would be skeptical of the firm straying far from chronic kidney disease or ESRD-related ventures because of the precedent set by the HealthCare Partners acquisition (for a total cash and stock consideration of $4.7 billion in 2012, net of cash acquired) and subsequent divestiture in 2019 (at a price of $3.8 billion, net of cash held). The current management teamled by new CEO but DaVita veteran and previous leader of the kidney care division, Javier Rodriguezhas noted a preference for tuck-in acquisitions related to kidney care, which we think is positive. In terms of size, management has indicated that considered deals would likely peak in the hundreds of millions of dollars range rather than the multi-billion-dollar range. We think smaller deals like that would be easier to integrate and manage for DaVita, as well.DaVita's balance sheet management is weak, and like most high-yield issuers, the company may need to refinance many of its obligations as they come due. DaVita operates with significant leverage, especially when considering lease obligations, and after rising above its target leverage range on profit contraction and share-repurchase activities, the firm now plans to focus on reducing debt to return to its leverage target. Once it reaches that leverage range, we would expect DaVita to return cash to shareholders through repurchases in an effort to boost its EPS growth above operating income growth. However, we generally have a mixed view of its share repurchases, given its high leverage and its recent miss of cheap valuations. We think investors should keep one key factor in mind, too. DaVita's largest shareholder, with a 40% stake as of March 2023, was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has a penchant for investing in firms with maintainable competitive advantages. ","DaVita is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, boasting market share that eclipses 35% when measured by both patients and clinics. The firm operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, mostly in the U.S., and treats over 240,000 patients globally each year. Government payers dominate U.S. dialysis reimbursement. DaVita receives about two thirds of U.S. sales at government (primarily Medicare) reimbursement rates, with the remainder coming from commercial insurers. However, while commercial insurers represented only about 10% of the U.S. patients treated, they represent nearly all of the profits generated by DaVita in the U.S. dialysis business.","Like many healthcare services providers, DaVita operates with significant leverage, especially when considering lease obligations. After recapitalizing its balance sheet and repurchasing shares following the 2019 sale of DaVita Medical Group, DaVita owed about $9 billion of debt and held $435 million of cash and short-term investments as of June 2023, or 3.7 times EBITDA, moderately above its net leverage target range of 3.0-3.5 times. Management has said it plans to focus on returning to its target leverage range by using excess cash flows on debt reduction rather than significant share repurchases, but once it reaches that target, we expect repurchases to resume. Also, operating lease obligations of $3 billion add another turn or so to leverage. After refinancing many of its obligations, including large maturities in 2024, the company's near-term maturity schedule looks easily manageable. Its next big maturity comes due in 2026 ($2.7 billion). Through 2027, we expect DaVita to generate about $1 billion on average of annual free cash flow, but since we expect share repurchases to resume once it hits its leverage target range, DaVita may need to refinance its larger maturities.",DVA,Healthcare,9528509440.0,NYQ,1193802.0,USD,99.4800033569336,True,0,93.8651761223294,114.21679065845804,1
24/11/2023,Search Disruption Won't Result in Google Displacement,Alphabet Inc,GOOGL,4,20/11/2023,Ali Mogharabi,138.49,USD,23/11/2023,161.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,20/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $161 fair value estimate on Alphabet, as we do not expect the latest events around OpenAI and Microsoft to significantly affect Google's artificial intelligence capabilities in the short or long term. Google remains in the same position as before the OpenAI ordeal, facing Microsoft, with access to OpenAI technology, in a race to develop features and uses that solve real-world problems. On Nov. 17, the board of OpenAI fired co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, which led to co-founder Greg Brockman announcing his departure. Altman and Brockman have joined Microsoft and a large percentage of talent at OpenAI will likely follow the co-founders. We still think that Google and other firms will also have an opportunity to attract a few OpenAI employees to their teams, including Google DeepMind. We remain confident about the resources and talent at hand at DeepMind, but we think the firm will need to increase its investments there more aggressively. Google may also try to acquire Anthropic, one of the leading independent artificial intelligence firms. Amazon may also be considering the same, as both have stakes in Anthropic. However, such an attempt could result in more antitrust scrutiny. We expect more internal pressure at Google to accelerate its efforts to match or exceed OpenAI, and now the Altman and Brockman team at Microsoft. According to some reports, Gemini, which was considered Google's better version of GPT-4, has been delayed until the first quarter of next year. While we do not think this will affect its cloud revenue much in the fourth quarter, the firm must meet the deadline next quarter. Otherwise, the patience of some current or potential cloud clients could wear thin, possibly affecting cloud revenue growth in 2024.","As the number of online users and usage increase, so will digital ad spending, of which Google will remain one of the main beneficiaries. Androids dominant global market share of smartphones leaves Google well positioned to continue generating top-line growth as search traffic shifts from desktop to mobile. The significant cash generated from the Google search business allows Alphabet to remain focused on innovation and the long-term growth opportunities that new areas present.","There is little revenue diversification within Alphabet, as it remains heavily dependent on Google and the state of the search ad space. Alphabet is allocating too much capital toward high-risk bets, which face a very low probability of generating returns. Googles dominant position in online search is not maintainable, as more companies and regulatory agencies are contesting the methods through which the company has been extending its leadership.",24/07/2023,"Alphabet dominates the online search market with 90%-plus global share (80%-plus U.S. share) for Google, via which it generates strong cash flow. We expect continuing search growth as we remain confident that Google will maintain its leadership despite Microsoft moving first to include generative artificial intelligence in Bing search. We also foresee YouTube and cloud contributing more to the firms top and bottom lines. Finally, we view investments in moonshots as attractive, with significant uncertainty but also substantial upside.  Googles ecosystem strengthens as its products are adopted by more users, making its online advertising services more attractive to advertisers and publishers and resulting in increased online ad revenue. We think ad revenue can continue to grow at high-single-digit rates during the next five years. The firm utilizes technological innovation to improve the user experience in nearly all its Google offerings, while making the sale and purchase of ads efficient for publishers and advertisers. Adoption and usage of mobile devices has been increasing. The online advertising market has taken notice and has followed its target audience onto the mobile platform. We have seen Google partake in this on the back of its Android mobile operating systems growing market share, helping it drive revenue growth and maintain its leadership in the space. Among the firms investment areas, we particularly applaud the efforts to gain a stronger foothold in the fast-growing public cloud market. Google has quickly leveraged the technological expertise it applied to creating and maintaining its private cloud platform to increase its market share in this area, driving additional revenue growth and creating more operating leverage, which we expect will continue. Most of Alphabets more futuristic projects are not yet generating revenue, but the upside is attractive if they succeed, as the firm is targeting newer markets. Alphabets autonomous car technology business, Waymo, is a good example: Based on various studies, it may tap into a market valued in the tens of billions of dollars within the next 10-15 years. ","We assign Alphabet a wide moat rating, thanks to durable competitive advantages derived from the companys intangible assets, as well as the network effect.We believe Alphabet holds significant intangible assets related to overall technological expertise in search algorithms and artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning), as well as access to and accumulation of data that is deemed valuable to advertisers. We also believe that Googles brand is a significant asset; ""Google it"" has become eponymous with searching, and regardless of actual technological competency, the firms search engine is perceived as being the most advanced in the industry. While with Microsofts Bing is attempting to dethrone Google with AI technology from OpenAI, we think the firm can defend its dominance in search with its own AI technology, some of which OpenAIs products are based on.In our opinion, Alphabets network effects are derived mainly through its Google products such as Search, Android, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and more. Ultimately, we view Googles network as heterogeneous. On the one side, all the products Google offers have provided it with a massive consumer base that allows the company to collect data. On the other side, via its rich collection of data and large user base, Google can offer the best return on investment for advertisers and build a growing network of advertising customers. The addition of each new ad and advertiser improves the efficiency of Googles programmatic advertising offerings, allowing the firm to better monetize the network.In search, Google has successfully and consistently monetized many of its technology-based intangible assets, from the original algorithms behind search to the current machine learning ones and the deep learning-based generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), which are also being applied to nearly every product. The company was recognized first for its ""extremely relevant results"" by PC Magazine in December 1998. From that point, it grew into the worlds most popular online search engine and has maintained its leadership. Google processes more than 3 times and 4 times as many search requests as Bing (Microsoft) and Yahoo, respectively. Google Searchs success stems from the relevance of its results to its users and the likelihood that this relevance will improve as more data is gathered and analyzed, assumptions are generated, and predictions are created. Google has used machine learning technology to improve the user experience. The company has applied machine learning to Search (speech recognition), Gmail (Smart Reply), Google Photos, Maps, and many other products, including its cloud offerings. As technological advancements improve the user experience for each product, the likelihood of further usage increases. The firm is also applying generative AI to enhance its search engines communication and response with users. Products with those features include Bard and the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which the firm is testing in its Search Labs. With generative AI in search, while clicks will likely decline, the search engine will have more data regarding users interest, which it can use for contextual campaigns for advertisers.Based initially on its technology, Google has successfully increased its users dependence on its products to keep transforming the usage of those products into something habitual. We have seen that with online search, as most people around the world continue to ""Google it."" It has strengthened its brand, which we think has longevity. We view the Google brand as a significant driver of user growth for YouTube, Maps, Gmail, and Chrome. Again, an expanding user base helps the company collect more data, which is monetized when applied to online ads.Google searchs large and growing user base has created a network difficult to replicate, in our view. We believe that an additional search on Googles search engine creates value for other users, as well as for advertisers and businesses. With AI (machine learning and deep learning) technology, more requests made by current and/or new users improve relevancy of search results, creating value for users. More relevant results also decrease the likelihood of users jumping to another search engine, creating somewhat of a barrier to exit.For advertisers, value is created mainly through growth of the large user base to target and from behavioral data compiled and analyzed. As users and search requests grow and more data is gathered, advertisers demands for ads increase, helping Google to further monetize the network. We think this can be strengthened in the long run with the application of generative AI.As with Google Search, we see network effects from large and growing user bases of other products, such as Maps, Gmail, and Chrome, all of which create value for users and advertisers. As more consumers use Maps, more data regarding traffic, commuting tendencies, and so forth is gathered, helping Google generate more accurate results (in terms of locations, travel times, and route suggestions). Google also utilizes such data to provide faster routes. Businesses and advertisers pay Google to place their search ads, targeted based on users locations and previous searches, within Maps search results list and directly on the map.Google's Chrome browser remains the market leader with nearly a 63% share, according to StatCounter, compared with over 20% for Apple's Safari and 5% for Microsoft's Edge. In our opinion, growth in Chrome browser usage helps increase the network effect for Google. In addition, by launching Android in 2007, Google positioned itself well in the faster-growing mobile ad market, maintaining its online search dominance and strengthening its network effect. According to IDC, Googles Android OS powers more than 87% of smartphones around the world, compared with Apple iOS' slightly over 12%. With Googles Chrome browser on Android phones, more mobile searches are conducted using Google. We note, however, that Google makes annual payments to Apple and Samsung for its search engine to be the default option on their mobile devices. Androids network effect also creates more value for users. As the number of Android-powered smartphones increases, more developers will create more apps to be made available on Google Play and run on those smartphones, creating additional value for Android smartphone users.We think YouTube is also valuable, as it benefits from a network effect that creates value for users, content creators, and advertisers. With more viewers on the site today, more content creators will look to YouTube for content distribution. Continuing growth of YouTubes content library drives further viewer growth. YouTubes video platform has more viewers than other online video properties, making it attractive for advertisers. We expect Google to gain a foothold in the growing enterprise cloud market, but we do not think its cloud offerings create a network effect. Although Amazon is clearly the leader in this space, we expect Google to gain further traction and trail only Amazon Web Services and Microsofts Azure in market share. Ultimately, we believe Google can leverage the technological expertise (including machine learnings and deep learning AI) it applied to creating and maintaining its private cloud platform to build and maintain public cloud platforms for many businesses.Regarding other potential moat sources, we do not believe Alphabet has a durable cost advantage when compared with its peers. Alphabets size allows it to invest heavily in Maps and YouTube, and perhaps in more capital-intensive businesses like enterprise cloud or Google Fiber. However, we dont see an inherent cost advantage in Alphabet that other tech titans like Apple and Amazon cant replicate, especially since cloud hardware is becoming increasingly commodified.We believe that customer switching costs provide Alphabet with only a negligible competitive advantage. Alphabets Google offerings, such as search, YouTube, Android, Maps, and Gmail, have some switching costs associated with time and effort needed to learn a new user interface, move content to another platform (YouTube) and notify contacts of an email change (Gmail), but such costs are not so prohibitive that these customers are locked in forever.Finally, while Alphabet generates economic profit through Google, which we think will continue, this profit would be higher were it not for Alphabets efforts to remaining a step ahead in terms of innovation. In its other bets segment, Alphabet is betting on (or investing in) using technology to enhance health (Verily), self-driving cars (Waymo), and much more. Some of these wagers may not bring in any winnings, and we believe it is too early to consider these businesses as contributors to Alphabets economic moat, either in terms of intangible assets or network effects.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Alphabet is High, primarily the result of high dependency on continuing online advertising growth. While we remain confident that Google will maintain its dominant position in the search market, a long-lasting downturn in online ad spending could have a negative impact on Alphabets revenue and cash flow, resulting in a lower fair value estimate. On the other hand, positive returns on Alphabets investments in cloud and moonshots could increase our fair value estimate considerably. Although the moat sources of intangible assets and network effect will help Google retain its competitive advantages, minimal switching cost to utilize a rival search engine remains a risk for the company. This risk remains manageable, in our view, as Microsofts Bing, the nearest competitor and the first-mover in enhancing search with generative AI capabilities, currently does not have significant presence in the mobile market, which is one of the main growth drivers of the search ad market. Google also has generative AI technology to defend its over 90% global search market share. The firms high dependence on user behavior data also represents an environmental, social, and governance risk, mainly due to risks related to data privacy and security, which could affect not only Googles advertising business but also users trust in the firms products as data can be misused.Google faces antitrust pressure and various claims and investigations brought by different companies and regulatory agencies regarding search bias and its overall market dominance in online advertising. Some governments may simply forbid access to some of Googles properties, which could result in lower user growth and monetization. Similar to Meta, Google also faces limitations in mergers and acquisitions as the U.S. and other countries attempt to lessen the firms dominance in advertising and the overall internet market.","We assign Alphabet a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Exemplary. The balance sheet remains sound. As the overall digital advertising market continues to mature, Alpahbets main source of revenue is becoming more cyclical. With more than $115 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only around $14 billion in debt (as of the end of first quarter 2023), Alphabets leverage ratios remain very low. We think continuing growth in Googles business-to-business segment, Google Cloud, will help offset this cyclicality. Alphabets strong network effect moat source should create operating leverage, albeit partially offset by increased legal and other costs related to data privacy and security issues, along with lobbying on the antitrust front. In any case, Alphabets financial health is virtually assured.On the investment front, we view the firms decisions as exceptional. Alphabets R&D investments (which have been growing at 15% in the last three years) remain at around 14%-16% as a percentage of revenue. Microsofts addition of generative AI features to Bing search is only the most recent possible technology disruption that supports our view that Googles continuing high R&D investments are justified. While the firm is not the first to commercialize its generative AI capabilities, we consider Google as a front-runner in AI. In  fact, generative pre-training transformer, or GPT, the technology created by OpenAI and used by Microsoft Bing, is based on an architecture that Google developed in 2017, which is widely used by other AI technology providers. In addition, Google has developed various technology which have similar capabilities to GPT and other AI-based products. Alphabet also continues to invest in various high-risk and high-reward projects, which if successful could generate significant returns for the company. Investment in autonomous vehicle technology (Waymo), is just one example. It appears that management aims to remain ahead of the pack by acquiring valuable assets to utilize and build upon, as it did with Android, YouTube, DoubleClick, AdMob, Motorola Mobility, Looker, and Fitbit. Management likely will continue making acquisitions and investments in futuristic projects, including artificial intelligence.In terms of shareholder distributions, Alphabet does not currently pay a dividend but it has implemented share-repurchase programs consistently. The firm repurchased shares totaling $18.4 billion, $31.1 billion, $50.3 billion, and $59 billion in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In late 2015, Alphabet became a holding company, with Google as one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Alphabet is also the parent company of other businesses, mostly moonshots, which are grouped into the other bets segment that includes Waymo. This structure has provided slightly more transparency to shareholders, as the companys mature cash-generating business, Google, is managed separately. In our opinion, such a move may indicate that management is considering some form of redistribution of cash generated by Google to shareholders a few years down the road.Under this structure, Larry Page, who co-founded Google and is a director, was the CEO of the parent company Alphabet. Sergey Brin, the other co-founder of Google and a director of Alphabet, was the president of the firm. In December 2019, Page and Brin left their roles (but remained on the board) and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, also became the CEO of Alphabet. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and was its product chief before becoming CEO in 2015. Susan Wojcicki, who has been with Google since 1999 and convinced Google to acquire YouTube, became CEO of YouTube in 2014. Thomas Kurian, former president of Oracles product development group, became the CEO of Google Cloud in 2019. Ruth Porat is the CFO of Alphabet and Google. She was CFO at Morgan Stanley before coming to Alphabet in 2015.Although managements decisions have generated exceptional returns for shareholders in the past, and are likely to continue doing so, we remain watchful regarding the high concentration of voting power. Page, Brin, and former CEO and former executive chair Eric E. Schmidt still have more than 55% voting power. In addition, given Alphabets multiclass share structure, it appears that this high concentration of power will remain intact in the long run, which could result in a significant conflict of interest if the cofounders and Schmidt, who is no longer with the firm, make too many high-risk wagers on futuristic projects. However, we have not seen any indications of this.","Alphabet is a holding company. Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google generates 99% of Alphabet revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Googles other revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as cloud service fees and other licensing revenue. Sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home, also contribute to other revenue. Alphabets moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), provide faster internet access (Google Fiber), enable self-driving cars (Waymo), and more. ","Alphabet has a very strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $114 billion and total debt of nearly $15 billion at the end of 2022. The company also has a $4 billion revolver with no outstanding balance. Over 60% of the companys cash and cash equivalents is held outside the U.S. The company generated $91.5 billion in cash from operations in 2022, flat compared with 2021. We expect cash from operations to grow 13% annually through 2027. While we see a return to double-digit top-line growth, we also expect the firm to continue to invest in innovation. Alphabets free cash flow to equity/gross revenue ratio averaged 24% over the past three years, which indicates strong operational and financial health. We model a five-year average FCFE/sales ratio of 28% through 2027.",GOOGL,Communication Services,1658970308608.0,NMS,31442263.0,USD,138.49000549316406,True,1,132.79729443718938,140.27555621111728,0
24/11/2023,"With Quebec Saturated, Expansion Outside Quebec Provides Quebecors Best Opportunities",Quebecor Inc,QBR.B,4,09/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,30.08,CAD,23/11/2023,40.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,C,09/11/2023,"Quebecor had a stronger quarter of wireless subscriber additions than we anticipated in the second quarter since it acquired Freedom Mobile. The rest of Quebecors business mirrored recent trends, with a stagnant internet business and all other businesses slowly declining. However, wireless is easily the most important business line, and we expect both wireless and internet subscriber growth to accelerate as Quebecor continues to find its footing outside Quebec. Were raising our fair value estimate to CAD 40 from CAD 38. Quebecor added 90,000 net mobile phone subscribers in the quarter, as it has already improved the service experience with Freedom Mobile and refined the plan offerings. We expect strength in the wireless business to grow, as the firm had not yet introduced in service areas outside the Freedom footprint, which it has now started to do in the fourth quarter through a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, offering, which will allow it to offer service by using the networks of competitors present in the area. The MVNO capability is a byproduct of the 2021 regulatory decision that also essentially requires Quebecor to build out its own network in those places within seven years. The wireless subscriber growth led to a 2.5% sequential rise in wireless revenue. Average revenue per user, or ARPU, was little changed compared with the prior quarter, but Freedom Mobile has reduced wireless ARPU from the levels Quebecor sported in Quebec prior to the acquisition, so ARPU was down almost 6% year over year. We dont anticipate any material growth from these lower ARPU levels, as we believe Quebecor will have to keep prices low to gain some market penetration. Overall, we think the competitive environment will pressure pricing for all competitors, but industry tailwinds stemming from Canadas expansive immigration policy should enable healthy subscriber growth for all major competitors.","Quebecors national wireless ambitions should benefit from a favorable regulatory environment. It should be able to offer promotions and gain share without taking significant economic losses. The unique culture within Quebec combined with Quebecors status as a local provider will allow it to maintain market share, profit margins, and returns on invested capital that competitors have been unable to achieve. The Media and Sports & Entertainment segments are poised to recover as a postpandemic society returns.","As a national wireless carrier, Quebecor will have none of the advantages that have made it successful in Quebec. As BCE completes its fiber-to-the-home buildout in Quebec, Quebecor will finally face a competitor that can offer comparable service, which will eat into its market share and ability to maintain such high margins.  Secular declines in television and wireline voice customers as well as more focus on lower-value Fizz customers will keep a lid on average revenue per telecom customer, limiting growth and further pressuring margins.",09/11/2023,"Telecom dominates Quebecors business, making up more than 85% of revenue and all of its EBITDA. The firm has historically focused its telecom efforts in Quebec, where it dominates the fixed-line market--providing broadband service to 60% of the homes its network passes--and holding its own in wireless against national providers. We estimate Quebecor has a 21% wireless market share in Quebec.  With further growth opportunities in Quebec limited, the firm made the strategic move to expand its wireless footprint nationwide. At the most recent spectrum auction, Quebecor won 3500 MHz spectrum licenses in Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia in addition to Quebec. In April 2023, Quebecor closed its acquisition of Freedom Mobile, which gave it an existing network and subscriber base in each of those provinces except Manitoba. In Manitoba, Quebecor will initially operate as a mobile virtual network operator after the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission issued a 2021 ruling requiring the big three wireless incumbents to offer wholesale capacity on their networks under certain conditions, which Quebecor meets, for seven years. With the acquisition and service accommodations made by Rogers to get the Freedom Mobile acquisition completed so that Rogers could acquire Shaw, we expect Quebecor to get off to a fast start in these new markets and to immediately provide a legitimate competitor to the Big Three national providers. The ability to begin operating nationally before it has to build its own network should keep Quebecor from maintaining a period of huge spikes in capital spending or economic losses in its wireless business. While we believe Quebecor has advantages in entering the national market, we see challenges that will prevent it from replicating its local success nationally. Without a fixed-line network, high name recognition, or a unique cultural presence--all attributes it has in Quebec--we expect it to require significant marketing and to rely primarily on undercutting incumbents on price to win market share, which we expect to limit margin expansion and revenue per user. ","Our narrow moat for Quebecor is based on the efficient scale pertaining to its telecom business in Quebec. Quebecor, with its Videotron brand, is the leading provider of fixed-line telecommunications services in Quebec, and it has averaged double-digit returns on invested capital over the past decade, well in excess of the roughly 7% weighted average cost of capital we estimate for the firm. We project returns on invested capital to remain steady at around 11% over the next five years.Over 40% of Quebecors total revenue comes from fixed-line telecom services, which have a dominant share in Canada. Quebecors network passes more than 3.5 million homes, which constitutes more than 80% of all households in Quebec, and Quebecor provides broadband service to roughly half of the homes within its footprint. Its primary competition is from BCE, the incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC. BCE historically had a copper network that left it inferior to Quebecors cable network. BCE has invested to cover much of its footprint with fiber to put it on a more even playing field in terms of quality, and it has now covered most of Montreal, Quebecs largest city, with fiber. With Quebecor entrenched as the provincial leader and BCE capable of providing a high-quality alternative in many areas, we see little potential for a third facilities-based competitor (one that owns infrastructure) to emerge. The costs to simply build a fixed-line network would be enormous. If a new competitor decided to undertake those costs, it would then need to go about taking share as an upstart competitor from familiar providers that already offer network quality the competitor would be looking to match. Such an ambition would certainly require huge marketing costs and promotional pricing, making the ability to ever earn sufficient returns on capital dubious. Fixed-line telecom historically, both in Quebec and globally, has experienced rational markets where a cable company and phone company compete, absent onerous regulation, and we dont expect any change from that norm in Quebec.Relative to BCE, we expect Quebecor to maintain its share lead. In a province that is culturally different from the rest of Canada and uses French as its official language, Quebecor is the local provider, and it prides itself on its customer friendliness. The firm has highlighted its number one ranking as Quebecs most respected telecom company for 12 years running in market research firm Legers annual survey. With its French-language programming and French-language over-the-top television app, we believe Quebecor is the firm that best caters to Quebecers, and its historical fixed-line results have proven it. We dont expect BCE could make a material dent in Quebecors leading position without drastic promotions. Given BCEs history of responsibly managing capital and a footprint that reaches nationwide, we dont believe it will risk depressing returns on the massive fiber investment it has made by getting into a price war with Quebecor.Although Quebecor hasnt had to make the network investment BCE has, and its telecom business has averaged adjusted EBITDA margins over 50% since 2017, materially ahead of all the biggest Canadian telecom firms, we arent assigning a cost advantage moat source for two reasons. First, it does not have the national scale of the biggest Canadian telecom firms, which is the key reason we have assigned them cost advantage moat sources, as they can spread their operating costs over much larger customer bases. Second, Quebecor is now taking its local mobile service national, and we think it may face cost headwinds in that ambition.Quebecors mobile business, which is part of its telecom segment, currently makes up about 30% of total company revenue. Although it is difficult to perfectly compare it with the big three national competitors, Rogers, BCE, and Telus, because they dont break out their subscriber results by province, we believe it is at least on even footing with those firms in Quebec. It currently has about 1.7 million mobile subscribers in a province that had just over 8 million people as of Canadas 2016 census. With its April 2023 acquisition of Freedom Mobile, the firm now also has more than 1.5 million mobile subscribers in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. We expect a period of low pricing and lower returns as Quebecor builds its national brand.We dont believe Quebecor has competitive advantages in its Media or Sports and Entertainment segments. Media makes up about 15% of total company revenue but only 4% of EBITDA and is dedicated to entertainment and news media. Its broadcasting group includes the largest French language private TV network in North America and about 10 television stations. The media group also publishes several newspapers and magazines, produces and distributes films and television shows, and participates in out of home advertising. Like other media businesses in Canada with similar offerings, its results have been choppy, and it hasnt shown an ability to grow profits. The Sports and Entertainment segment consists primarily of the ownership of sports and entertainment venues as well as production and promotion of live events and ownership in two junior hockey league teams. While it takes very little incremental capital investment, it has never reliably turned a profit.While Quebecors dominant telecom position in Quebec makes us consider whether its moat could be wide, two concerns weigh against that. First, we have hesitated to award Canadian telecom firms wide moats because of the ongoing threat of regulatory intervention. The Canadian government is always cognizant of keeping its market competitive, and Canadian media and the population continually gripe about high telecom prices in Canada. Considering the quality of Canadian networks, we dont think pricing is too high and believe regulators always weigh the risk of stifling investment, but we believe regulatory threats will be a continuing uncertainty.Quebecors national wireless ambitions is the second reason we are not awarding it a wide moat. Even if its business in Quebec is worthy of a wide moat, we dont yet see any moat in a national wireless strategy, and the spending and risk Quebecor will undertake as it looks to become a national wireless carrier will weigh on the returns wed otherwise expect it to have.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Quebecor is Medium. The firm's core business in Quebec has been very stable and would lead us to characterize future uncertainty as low, but its efforts to expand its wireless business nationally lead us to believe a wider range of outcomes is possible over the next several years.From an operating perspective, we think the biggest risk to Quebecor stems from how its national wireless strategy develops. It may have difficulty breaking through in markets where it faces entrenched, national competitors with high name recognition. It has invested heavily to buy Freedom Mobile, a small national provider that nonetheless has built national infrastructure and invested in multiple spectrum bands or build its wireless infrastructure from scratch. The ability to successfully and efficiently gain market share in provinces outside Quebec is questionable, but regulatory tailwinds give Quebecor potential to compete with the big three wireless providers nationally.In Quebec, Quebecor faces the typical secular risks to fixed-line providers, namely a perpetual move away from linear television programming and landline phones. In addition, BCE has become a stronger competitor as it has replaced its copper network with fiber, a project that continues.The biggest ESG risks we see revolve around broadband and wireless communications essential function in society and the sensitive data they control. Regulators may take a heavy hand in ensuring providers reach all residents at reasonable prices--potentially limiting pricing power, enabling new competitors, and forcing higher spending even when it doesnt make economic sense. With access to sensitive information, data breaches also pose a persistent risk. Lastly, Quebecor is family-controlled through dual share classes, a structure that has recently been scrutinized in Canada in the wake of the Rogers family fallout.","We assign Quebecor a Standard capital allocation rating. Our rating is based on the health of Quebecors balance sheet and our outlook in regard to investment in the business and shareholder distributions. We think business investment is likely to be the primary driver of shareholder returns.Quebecor has increased its dividend significantly in recent years while also continuing to repurchase shares. We believe these are both good uses of cash, as the dividend payout remains below 50% of free cash flow, and we see the stock as undervalued, making the share repurchases value-accretive. We think the key to investor returns, however, is continuing investment in the business. Quebecor has sufficiently invested in its fixed and wireless networks in Quebec to maintain market leadership. With continuing spectrum purchases and a more gradual buildout of a 5G network than most peers, we believe future investment will continue to be very responsible. We dont see a need for an immediate wireless upgrade to 5G and believe the more measured approach is both sufficient and fiscally advantageous, as it will allow Quebecor to invest elsewhere. Namely, investment will go to building a national wireless network after acquiring Freedom Mobile in April 2023. The national wireless ambition carries risk, but we believe the Freedom acquisition and favorable regulatory actions that will allow Quebecor to use the networks and facilities of incumbents for several years in areas where its network is not yet sufficient will be an advantage and make the ambition a risk worth taking.Quebecors balance sheet is sufficiently well positioned to take on what we expect to be higher capital intensity as the firms wireless business goes national, and we classify it as having moderate balance sheet risk. The firms net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio remained around 3.0 prior to the Freedom acquisition, slightly below where most major peers have taken leverage recently. We expect the leverage ratio to be more in line with peersin the 3.5-4.0 rangefollowing the Freedom acquisition and as Quebecor continues to expand its wireless network nationally and buys new spectrum. We view Quebecors debt maturity schedule as well laddered. The firm has no material debt maturing before 2024, when CAD 800 million comes due. After that, between CAD 400 million and CAD 1.1 billion in debt matures each year through 2031.","Quebecor primarily provides telecom services in Quebec, where it has roughly 1.7 million internet subscribersequating to a penetration rate of about 50% in its footprintand over 3 million mobile subscribers, including more than 20% wireless market share in Quebec. With the acquisition of Freedom Mobile in April 2023, Quebecor also has more than 1.5 million mobile subscribers in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. Quebecor also offers a French-language subscription video on demand service and has a media segment that owns and operates television stations, publishes newspapers and magazines, and produces and distributes films and television shows. A very small portion of Quebecors business engages in live event production and promotion and has ownership of live-event venues.","Quebecors leverage has generally been in line with its major peers. It currently enjoys a relatively stronger financial position as the major national carriers have been participating in spectrum auctions, building 5G networks, and, in the case of the phone companies, building fiber networks. Quebecors net debt stood at 3.2 times EBITDA at the end of 2022, but we expect that to rise to about 3.5 as Quebecor launches its national wireless ambitions. We expect Quebecor to be a bigger player in future spectrum auctions, as it was for the first time in 2021s 3500 MHz auction, and to build a national wireless network. Quebecors historical fiscal responsibility should give it ample flexibility to pursue these capital outlays, but we expect it will keep leverage above 3.0 for the next several years and preclude other activity.Still, we expect Quebecor will have no trouble covering its obligations. We project the firms interest coverage ratio to remain at about 3.5, and its debt maturity schedule is well laddered.

25/11/2023,"Discover Is Benefiting From High Loan Growth, but Credit Costs Are Set to Rise",Discover Financial Services,DFS,5,19/10/2023,Michael Miller,86.77,USD,24/11/2023,152.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,19/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Discover reported weak third-quarter results as the bank's credit costs rose sharply. Discover's net revenue increased 17% from last year to $4.04 billion. Earnings per share declined 27% year over year to $2.59, which translates to a return on equity of 19%. The drop in profitability was due to higher credit provisioning costs, as the company built $601 million in reserves during the quarter. As we incorporate these results, we do not expect to materially alter our $152 per share fair value estimate. We see the shares as undervalued right now. While Discover's credit quality continues to deteriorate, the rate of decline was faster than we had anticipated. Discover's credit card portfolio, which provides the bulk of its revenue and earnings, saw its net charge-off rate rise to 4.03% from 2.88% last year. To make matters worse, after a period of relative stability, the bank's delinquency ratios also increased sharply, with the 30-day credit card delinquency rate rising to 3.41% from 2.86% last quarter. We expect net charge-offs to continue increasingand to be elevated next yearand we note that the acceleration in Discover's delinquency rate bears monitoring as it comes despite a surprisingly resilient labor market and may be a sign that the end of student loan forbearance is affecting credit results. Discover's revenue growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, which increased 17% year over year to $3.3 billion. Higher net interest income was due to strong loan growth, with the bank's average receivables increasing 18% from the prior-year quarter. Loan growth was partially offset by net interest margin compression, though, with the bank's NIM falling to 10.95% from 11.05% last year. While Discover did initially benefit from rising rates, increased competition for deposits has led to higher funding costs. That said, we do not expect to see much more margin compression as we reach the tail end of the Fed's tightening cycle.",Discover has consistently been able to generate returns on equity that are among the highest of its peers. Discovers credit card receivables growth has been above the industry average for some time now. This outperformance continued in even in 2020 when its receivables balance shrank less than its peers'. Discover has made good progress in improving its deposit base through online savings accounts and more recently online checking.,"Discover is subject to the same competitive rewards environment as other credit card issuers. Its rewards rate has climbed over time and is likely to continue to do so. Discover has a higher cost of funding than some of its peers, giving it a disadvantage when funding a portfolio of receivables. Discover's credit costs are rising as credit card net charge-offs rise in the face of deteriorating economic conditions.",03/08/2023,"As consumer debt repayment rates in the United States normalize, Discover is enjoying a period of significant loan growth. On the other hand, while credit costs had initially normalized slower from historic lows than we had initially expected, they have increased materially in the first of 2023 and we expect them to rise further as we head into 2024. We do not expect this to put any pressure on the bank's balance sheet, though, as the firm is in a strong financial position with good reserves. Additionally, Discover's net interest income will benefit from a larger credit card receivable base now that growth has returned. The bank ended June 2023 with just under than $94 billion in credit card loans, 18.6% higher than the prior year. Discover generates most of its revenue through interest income from its credit cards (roughly 70% of its net revenue). While the company has substantial private student debt and personal loan portfolios in addition to operating its own payment network, its long-term health will be driven by its ability to build and maintain its portfolio of credit card receivables. Discovers credit card business has historically been a strong performer, with receivable growth and credit results better than most of its peers. With the majority of its credit cards and student loans charging variable interest rates, the bank is a beneficiary of rising interest rates, though this is limited by the firm's reliance on online and brokered deposits, which tend to be more interest rate-sensitive.  In the long run, Discover must continue to deal with the challenges that come with being smaller than many of its competitors in size and scope. Many of the traditional banks that the company competes with can offer their cardholders a broader selection of products and services. Discover's more traditional competitors often benefit from a lower cost of funding driven by their strong deposit bases. While it is unlikely that Discover will ever fully replicate the product offerings of some its peers, it has made good progress in improving its funding cost through the use of online savings accounts and has begun to expand into checking. ","In our view, Discover has a narrow moat around its business that will allow it to continue to earn returns on equity above its cost of capital for the immediate future. Discover benefits from the implicit switching costs of its cardholders, its lean cost structure as a direct bank, and some limited cross-selling opportunities available from its multiple product lines. The advantages have allowed Discover returns on equity that have consistently been between 20% and 25%, and we expect that as a result of its narrow moat, the company will continue to enjoy these strong returns for some time.The majority of Discovers revenue is generated through its credit card business where, much like American Express, it operates as a closed-loop network in which the company issues credit cards to consumers and forms direct relationships with the merchants receiving payments. Unlike American Express, Discover generates most of its revenue from interest income generated from its customer loan balances, with less than 20% of its revenue coming from noninterest income. The company also has a strong competitive position in the private student loan market, where it is the second largest by market share, and has a sizable debt consolidation business. While smaller than its credit card business, Discovers student and personal loans make up roughly 20% of total receivables and contribute meaningfully to the bottom line. Discovers credit card business is focused on building a portfolio of cardholders who maintain large revolving balances as opposed to consumers who may spend heavily on their cards but pay off their balance monthly. Discover has been largely successful in building said portfolio, with total credit card receivables nearly half the size of its total 2020 purchase volume. This is a complicated underwriting task, as the company must offer credit cards to consumers with weak enough credit that they will carry a balance but not so weak that they will eventually default on their debt. Discover also needs to develop rewards and marketing that are attractive to consumers who are likely to accrue interest payments while doing its best to avoid attracting high spenders with low balances. This is not easy and requires a significant investment of time and capital as cardholders with weaker credit need to be weeded out over time. This investment has the benefit of creating a cardholder base with relatively high switching costs, as consumers with large existing balances will face difficulties in getting approved at another firm. Building this kind of loan portfolio is not easy for a new entrant, as it requires a significant investment of time as well as sophisticated credit models built on past loan data that only existing credit card issuers have access to.As a direct bank, Discover takes deposits and issues loans without the cost of maintaining any branches or meaningful physical infrastructure. This gives it a cost advantage over some of its larger competitors despite its more limited scale. As a result, Discover has managed to keep its operating structure lean, with efficiency ratios that have historically stayed below 40%, well below those of many traditional banks. This is partially counteracted by Discovers higher cost of funding, which was 1.87% in 2020. This is a symptom of Discovers smaller size and a deposit base that still makes use of more costly certificates of deposit. Discover has made improvements here, with its savings deposits making up a steadily increasing portion of its total funding. It is unlikely that Discover will ever be able to close the gap between it and the larger credit card issuers, but the improvement helps support its strong margins and already impressive efficiency ratios. Outside its credit card business, Discover is the second-largest issuer of private student loans. While private student debt has grown rapidly in recent years, the total student loan market is dominated by the federal government, which holds more than 90% of outstanding balances. With such an extensive government presence and the fact that private student loans are typically the second choice for student borrowers, we think it will probably be difficult for Discover to prevent its student lending business from becoming commoditized over time, given its lack of competitive advantage. We also see this industry as being exposed to shifts in government policy that could either hurt or help the company. In a similar vein, Discover has reduced its investment in its debt consolidation business as it believes the competition in that industry has become too intense for it to generate the kinds of returns it is accustomed to. On their own, we do not see these business lines as having significant moats to them. But while Discover has less of an advantage in these fields, it does benefit from having multiple lines of consumer finance as well as its direct banking platform. Discovers credit cards often act as an entry point for consumers into the companys broader platform, and roughly 70% of the companys depositors have another outstanding account with the firm. This increases switching costs for Discovers cardholders and depositors, making these relationships stickier. On the network side, Discover is the third most widely accepted credit card in the United States, though at this point both Discover and American Express have rough parity with Visa and Mastercard in acceptance, making exact ranking somewhat moot. Outside of the U.S., Discover has signed network agreements with national card networks in order to extend the acceptance of its cards internationally. However, there are still plenty of holes in the acceptance of Discover cards overseas, and the Discover networks broad reach has come at the cost of fee rates at or below those of competitors.","We give Discover a high fair value uncertainty rating. The company generates more than 80% of its revenue through net interest income, with interest on credit card balances being its primary source of revenue. Because of the focus on building a portfolio of interest-paying consumer loans, the company is highly exposed to the credit and interest-rate cycles. This means that much of its performance depends on macro factors that it has no control over. Credit costs began to rise in the second half of 2022 and consumers are being pressured by inflation. We expect this trend to continue in 2023 and project materially higher net charge-offs both this year and next as economic pressure and higher borrowing rates lead to more delinquencies. That said, the bank's strong financial position, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% at the end of June 2022, should allow it to withstand higher credit losses, and we do not foresee the bank coming under severe financial pressure in the near term. Discover does have some exposure to ESG risk. Credit cards carry inherit product risk as they can trap consumers in a cycle of continuously paying high interest rates as they struggle to reduce the principal. The CFPB has proposed new rules to limit credit card late fees, which will reduce Discover's noninterest income if implemented. In our view, this risk is more significant for Discover than some of its peers since its business strategy focuses on building a portfolio of cardholders with high ongoing balances. Discover has also had internal product governance issues, with share repurchases being paused twice in the last two years pending internal reviews. During its second-quarter 2023 earnings, Discover announced that it had found they had been overcharging the merchants that accept its cards and that the bank would set aside $365 million for merchant compensation. While this represents less than 2% of Discover's equity, there is potential for reputational damage. ","We give Discover an Exemplary rating for capital allocation. The company ended June 2023 with its balance sheet in a strong position, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% and an allowance for bad loans that was 6.8% of total receivables. Despite expectations for higher charge-offs in second-half 2023, we see this as sufficient. Discover has typically had a modest dividend payout ratio, instead choosing to use share repurchases as the primary vehicle to return value to shareholders. The company reduced its share count by more than 21% from 2018 to 2022. In light of Discovers macroeconomic exposure through its heavy reliance on credit card receivables, we see a repurchase heavy policy as appropriate, as the company's cash flow and balance sheet needs are heavily influenced by the credit and interest-rate cycles. We are impressed by Discovers investment discipline. The companys decision to pull back from the personal loan market due to excessive competition has been validated by lower returns and higher credit costs in that space. The company also continues to invest in technology--a necessity, given Discovers direct banking platform. While still in the initial stages, the companys rollout of online checking accounts should provide a cheap source of funding, helping the bank close the funding gap with many of its peers.","Discover Financial Services is a bank operating in two distinct segments: direct banking and payment services. The company issues credit and debit cards and provides other consumer banking products including deposit accounts, students loans, and other personal loans. It also operates the Discover, Pulse, and Diners Club networks. The Discover network is the fourth-largest payment network in the United States as ranked by overall purchase volume, and Pulse is one of the largest ATM networks in the country.","Efforts to conserve capital by suspending share buybacks in the initial stages of the pandemic paid off and the company was able to navigate the uncertainty of 2020 and 2021 with ease. Discover is in a strong financial position, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of ratio of 11.7% at the end of June 2023. Given a long-term target ratio of 10.5%, Discover does have room to return value to shareholders by restarting share repurchases, though given our expectations for higher credit costs in 2023 and 2024 it would be understandable if Discover decides to retain excess capital. In our view, Discover is well positioned financially, given that historically the firm has had strong underwriting standards with credit card net charge-off rates below many of its peers. The firm has had success in improving its funding, with more than 70% of total funding now coming from deposits. On the other hand, Discover primarily relies on online savings accounts and brokered deposits. This means it must compete on price for accounts, giving it a higher cost of funding than many of its traditional banking peers. The company is seeking to mitigate this with an expansion into online checking, but these efforts are still in their early stages.

24/11/2023,Stericycle's Transformation Gains Steam as It Completes Another ERP Milestone,Stericycle Inc,SRCL,4,02/11/2023,Brian Bernard,45.32,USD,23/11/2023,59.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,02/11/2023,"Putting aside lower recycled sorted office paper prices and surcharges compared with the year-ago quarter and revenue lost with divestitures, we thought Stericycle reported solid third-quarter results. The companys competitively advantaged regulated waste and compliance services segment (67% of sales) reported 4% organic revenue growth, primarily driven by pricing actions. And while the secure information destruction services business saw a 12% decline in organic revenue, that decline was almost entirely due to lower paper prices and fuel and environmental surcharges. Nevertheless, Stericycle is better protected from paper price volatility now than in the past due to contract adjustments implemented by the current management team. Adjusted EBITDA margin fell 250 basis points year over year to 14.8%, but again, lower paper prices were an outsize contributor to the margin decline. Based on our math, Stericycles adjusted EBITDA margin wouldve been in line with the prior year (at 17.3%), holding paper prices constant. In our view, SOP prices are normalizing from unusually high levels reached in mid-2022, and we expect related revenue and margin headwinds will abate for Stericycle during the second half of 2024. More importantly, Stericycle successfully launched its new enterprise resource planning platform across its U.S. RWCS business. Approximately 80% of Stericycles business is on the new platform, and management expects to complete the international roll out by 2025. With less headcount needed to manage manual processes, management announced a workforce reduction plan that will save the company $8 million in annualized costs. We think theres further opportunity to optimize labor costs, which should support margin expansion next year. Weve reduced our fair value estimate 2% to $59 per share due to our tempered near-term growth and profit margin expectations, but our long-term view is intact, and we continue to think the stock is undervalued.","Stericycle's turnaround efforts will prove successful, materially improving the firm's profitability and free cash flow. Medical waste volume should grow faster than U.S. GDP due to an aging population that requires more medical procedures. Stericycle's leading position in an expanding market should improve the firm's financial prospects.  Stericycle is past the apex of pricing pressure related to private practice consolidation and a customer class action lawsuit. Going forward, the firm should realize annual price increases above inflation.","Stericycle's Shred-It business is a no-moat business in secular decline. This ill-advised 2015 acquisition could haunt the current management team and prevent the firm from realizing its long-term financial goals. The ERP project has cost Stericycle over $400 million since its inception. Future cost overruns or implementation difficulties could cause uneven financial performance.  Stericycle's days of double-digit annual price increases are over. While client healthcare consolidation may be slowing, pricing pressure could persist and constrain Stericycle's profit margins. ",02/11/2023,"Since its founding in 1989, Stericycle had been extremely acquisitive, having acquired over 500 companies. On the surface, this acquisitive strategy led to a lengthy period of impressive growth and the firm built unmatched scale. However, acquisitions began to stray from Stericycle's core competencies and poor integration efforts caused inefficiencies to build. After decades of strong growth and profitability, Stericycle's financial performance began to deteriorate in 2017. However, with a refreshed management team, led by CEO Cindy Miller, we now believe Stericycle has turned the corner. With Miller at the helm, Stericycle has divested low-margin, noncore businesses, most notably, environmental solutions. The enterprise resource planning implementation project continues, and we expect it will be completed within the next couple of years. We expect a common ERP system will streamline Stericycle's operations and improve the firm's financial planning and analysis. Finally, Miller has implemented much needed oversight and standardization, for example, customer contracts are now reviewed by a deal review committee. Management's turnaround efforts are taking hold. Both the regulated waste and and compliance and secure information destruction services segments have reported organic growth since 2020 and consolidated gross profit margin has substantially improved compared with 2019. Stericycle's self-help measures and significant exposure to the growing United States medical waste market should result in solid top-line growth and margin expansion over the next five years. We forecast Stericycle's revenue to grow at about a 3% five-year compound annual rate and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand to around 23.5% by 2027 from (17.5% to 18.5% during 2019-21). Most importantly, we expect return on new invested capital will rebound to the low double digits by 2025.","We believe Stericycle's regulated waste and compliance segment enjoys a narrow economic moat. We see a scale-driven cost advantage as the segment's primary moat source with intangible assets (licenses and permits) and switching costs as secondary moat sources that create additional barriers to entry and support high customer retention rates (about 90%). Customer retention rates were relatively unaffected by the class-action lawsuit as customers have few alternatives.Stericycle has long dominated the North American medical waste space, and the next largest national competitor is Sharps Compliance, which generates less than 3% of Stericycle's global regulated waste and compliance revenue and is barely profitable (Aurora Capital Partners acquired Sharps in August 2022). Aside from Sharps, there are a couple hundred small private local and regional medical waste operations. The three largest traditional solid waste management companies have either failed to enter the space or decided to not even try. We believe Stericycle's regulated waste and compliance segment possesses a scale-driven cost advantage, underpinned by superior route density and fixed cost leverage compared with its much smaller competitors. Stericycle's dominant market share oftentimes translates into dense collection routes, which allows the firm to collect more medical waste per mile driven and direct more volume through its transfer sites and processing facilities (that is, better asset utilization) as compared with smaller competitors that operate sparser routes. Furthermore, the firm's scale allows it to spread its selling, general, and administrative costs over a greater revenue base relative to its competition.We see Stericycle's cost advantage as a strong deterrent to new entrants, which has helped defend the firm's high market share. Given Stericycle's superior unit economics, the firm can price lower than competitors that must also grapple with high startup costs (for example, collection vehicles, processing facilities). Even municipal solid waste giant Waste Management struggled to profitably enter the medical waste market and decided to move on rather than press on and incur losses.In our view, Stericycle's strong market share in the medical waste market is also supported by two other moat sources, intangible assets and switching costs, which can prove to be challenging barriers for new entrants and existing competitors to overcome.The medical waste industry is heavily regulated, and operators must acquire myriad licenses, permits, and other authorizations. Permits for hospital, medical, and infectious waste, or HMIW, incinerators are the most challenging to obtain. We consider the difficulty in obtaining new incinerator permits akin to, or perhaps even more challenging than, obtaining permits for new solid waste landfills. Indeed, stringent Environmental Protection Agency regulations caused the number of incinerators to plummet from several thousand in the late 1990s to less than 60 by 2010. Sharps Compliance has recently disclosed there are only 10 permitted commercial incinerators for medical waste and unused pharmaceuticals in the U.S., and we believe Stericycle owns most of these (Sharps owns one).Stringent environmental regulations and alternative disposal methods (mainly autoclaves, which uses high pressure and steam to sterilize medical waste) have greatly reduced the role incinerators play in medical waste disposal today. Indeed, according to the EPA, over 90% of potential infectious medical waste was incinerated before 1997, but that figure has shrunk to less than 10% today. Still, incinerators are used to dispose of trace chemotherapy, pathological, and other hazardous waste. Given that incinerators still play a crucial role in disposing of high-risk medical waste streams, and we believe it is unlikely new incinerators will be constructed, Stericycle's control of this scarce asset helps the firm retain customers that need access to incinerators. Medical waste operators must obtain permits to transport medical waste and construct and operate transfer stations and processing facilities. Many of these permits are granted by local jurisdictions, but some come from other entities. We acknowledge many of the permits needed to transport and process medical waste can be obtained by competitors, but it can be a lengthy process. Furthermore, new processing facility proposals can face community opposition that can delay or scuttle the projects. Medical waste generators must comply with myriad state and federal regulations that can be strict and onerous, and violations can result in significant monetary and reputational damage. For example, state regulations can place cradle-to-grave liability on waste generators, meaning the ultimate liability for mishandled medical waste can fall on the generator even if the collection and disposal process is managed by a third party. We believe the substantial risks involved with medical waste disposal dissuades generators from switching to less reputable providers and makes managing some of the disposal process in-house a less attractive proposition. We think this assertion is especially true given that waste disposal represents a small cost for generators. We estimate that medical waste disposal accounts for well below 1% of hospital costs and perhaps costs a few grand annually for a small-quantity generator. Stericycle's secure information destruction services segment consists of its Shred-It business it acquired in October 2015 for $2.5 billion (10.8 times EBITDA with synergies and 14 times EBITDA without synergies). Like Stericycle's medical waste business, Shred-It is a route-based business serving regulated markets with leading market share. However, unlike the medical waste business, Shred-It has a much more formidable, albeit still smaller, competitor in Iron Mountain's $400-million information destruction business (about half the size of Shred-It) and the market is more fragmented with thousands of private regional and local competitors compared with hundreds of these firms in the medical waste market. We assign Stericycle's secure information destruction segment a no-moat rating. However, because we estimate the segment accounts for less than 50% of Stericycle's earnings, it doesn't prevent us from assigning the consolidated firm a narrow moat rating. We believe the segment has a scale advantage (better route density and overhead cost leverage) compared with smaller regional and local competitors; however, we don't think it benefits from intangible assets or switching costs. While there are regulations for data destruction, we think many businesses are less concerned about the risk of shredding documents in-house as evidenced by the large portion of the market that Stericycle believes is unvended (50%-60%). Furthermore, our analysis of Shred-It's historical financial performance supports our no-moat rating, in our view. The business Stericycle acquired in 2015 was created a year earlier through the combination of privately held Shred-It and Cintas' paper shredding business. Based on our estimates, Cintas' paper shredding business struggled to earn the consolidated company's cost of capital between 2006 and 2014. While Cintas was bullish on its paper shredding business early on, it proved to be its most volatile business due to changes in paper prices that are difficult to forecast and can have an outsize effect on profit margins. Cintas also found it more challenging than expected to cross sell its paper shredding services to customers using its other services. As such, Cintas' management decided to move on from the business. We're unsold on the strategic merits of the Shred-It acquisition, and we think the prior management team overpaid for the business given its long-term prospects. Still, despite the specter of a shrinking market, Shred-It has posted organic revenue growth (aside from pandemic-stricken 2020) since its acquisition. We believe the current management team, with its narrowed focus on optimizing its core assets, can better realize Shred-It's scale-driven cost advantage and perhaps achieve modest excess returns. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Stericycle is Medium. We see four main risks for the firm.First, Stericycle continues to progress through its ERP system implementation, which has cost several hundred million dollars so far (including both operating and capital expenditures). Future cost overruns or implementation difficulties could cause uneven near-term financial performance and could ultimately cause the firm to fall short of management's five-year revenue growth, free cash flow, and leverage targets.Second, Stericycle's future growth and profitability prospects are partially dependent on management's execution. We like the actions management has taken so far to improve revenue quality and optimize the company's cost structure. Strong execution will need to continue if management hopes to defend the firm's competitive advantages and achieve maintainably higher profit margins.Third, we believe its a consensus view that paper shredding is a declining market. However, the slope of that decline is debatable. We believe Stericycle is positioned to outperform a market that will shrink at a low- to mid-single-digit pace over our forecast. However, our financial forecasts would be affected if the market and/or Stericycle's relative performance materially differs from our expectations. Still, we estimate that Stericycle's security information destruction business will only account for approximately 25% of the firm's EBITDA in our midcycle year. Finally, we see emissions, effluents, and waste as Stericycle's most significant environmental, social, and governance risk. Improper waste collection and disposal practices can result in fines, remediation costs, and damage the firm's reputation. Overall, we think Stericycle has a strong track record that few, in any, competitor can replicate. While remediation costs or reputational damage could be material, we see a low probability of these events occurring over the next decade.","We assign Stericycle a Standard capital allocation rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, satisfactory investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions.Stericycle's net leverage ratio is now within its long-term target (net debt/EBITDA is approximately 2.8 versus the below 3 target). Stericycle has about $1.3 billion of net outstanding debt with senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2029. However, we forecast the firm will generate about $1.4 billion of cumulative cash flow over the next five years, so we expect the firm will be able to reduce its outstanding debt. As such, we believe Stericycle has a sound balance sheet.We assess Stericycle's investment strategy as satisfactory. If our capital allocation methodology were backward looking, we'd consider a poor rating given prior management's missteps. However, our methodology is forward looking, and we believe current management has taken the right steps to support the firm's competitive advantages and improve returns on invested capital. For example, management divested low-margin, noncore businesses, it continues to invest in a much-needed common ERP system, and it has instituted myriad initiatives to improve the firm's revenue quality and cost structure. Finally, we believe Stericycle's shareholder distribution policy is appropriate. While the firm doesn't pay a dividend and hasn't repurchased a meaningful amount of its stock in years, we think this policy is appropriate given that the firm is in turnaround mode and needs to complete its ERP implementation and reduce its leverage.","Stericycle is the largest provider of medical waste disposal and data destruction (primarily paper shredding) services in the United States. Its next closest national competitor in the medical waste disposal space is Sharps Compliance, which generated $76 million of sales in fiscal 2021 before its 2022 acquisition (about 4% of Stericycle's global regulated waste and compliance revenue). Stericycle's data destruction business (Shred-It) is about twice the size of its closest competitor (Iron Mountain's information destruction segment). Stericycle has a global presence, with about 20% of its revenue earned outside North America. ","Stericycle's debt balance increased by over $1.5 billion in 2015 a result of the Shred-It acquisition. As the company's financial performance deteriorated in subsequent years, the firm's net debt/EBITDA ratio swelled to approximately 4.5. However, the current management team is committed to rightsizing the balance sheet, and the firm's leverage ratios have already become more palatable (net debt/adjusted EBITDA was about 2.8 as of September 2023).Stericycle ended its third-quarter 2023 with $1.3 billion of net debt. The firm's outstanding balance on its credit facility and term loan (approximately $170 million) is due in 2026, $600 million of 5.375% senior notes is due in 2024, and $500 million of 3.875% senior notes is due in 2029. Over the next five years, we project Stericycle will generate approximately $1.4 billion of free cash, so we're not concerned about the firm's ability to service its outstanding debt, and we believe management's goal of maintaining its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio below 3 is achievable. Stericycle has plenty of liquidity with approximately $1.1 billion available on its $1.2 billion credit facility.",SRCL,Industrials,4455000576.0,NMS,517950.0,USD,45.31999969482422,True,1,43.41294129315882,49.661481409900006,1
24/11/2023,Alnylam's Narrow Moat Based on Intangibles From RNAi Tech and Lengthy Patents Will Drive Growth,Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc,ALNY,4,09/11/2023,Rachel Elfman,162.88,USD,23/11/2023,199.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,09/11/2023,"Alnylam reported solid third-quarter results highlighted by $313 million in net product revenue, representing a 35% year-over-year increase. Alnylams results are largely tracking our expectations, and we maintain our fair value estimate of $199 per share. We view shares as undervalued, currently trading about 15% below our fair value estimate. During the quarter, Alnylam received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its pipeline candidate, patisiran, for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of transthyretin-mediated, or ATTR, amyloidosis. As a result, management has decided to no longer pursue an expanded indication for patisiran in the United States. Patisiran is already approved under the name Onpattro for the treatment of polyneuropathy in ATTR amyloidosis. Despite this setback, we think Alnylam remains in a strong position and is focused on its Helios-B phase 3 study evaluating vutrisiran, which is an RNAi therapeutic subcutaneously administered once every three months in development for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of ATTR amyloidosis. Vutrisiran is on track to report top-line results in early 2024, and we expect it could receive approval as early as 2025 with a 45% probability of approval in our base case. We expect Alnylams competitor, Ionis, to receive approval for its pipeline candidate, eplontersen, in amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy in December. Alnylam is already entrenched in this space, with total sales of Onpattro and next-generation drug Amvuttra growing 35% year over year to $231 million during the quarter. We still expect Alnylam will retain leadership in this market, but with Ionis having AstraZeneca as its global collaboration partner and a more convenient, self-administered product, we think Ionis is positioned to create some competition for Alnylam.","Alnylam's Nobel-prize-winning technology and massive intellectual property in RNA interference helped the firm create an entirely new class of therapeutics for difficult to treat diseases. Alnylam's full pipeline offers several opportunities to bolster the company's competitive position, and it indicates a reproducible research strategy. Onpattro is the first approved RNA interference therapy. In addition to first-mover advantage, Alnylam is positioned to expand its reach in ATTR amyloidosis with next-generation Amvuttra, which is administered less frequently.","Alnylam's valuation rests on its ability to maintain six-figure pricing and payers' willingness to continue reimbursement, which could be affected by shifts in healthcare drug policy.  While Alnylam is targeting several rare genetic disorders--including amyloidosis, AHP, and  complement-mediated diseases--entrenched competitors are also progressing next-generation treatments. As is the case with most orphan diseases, if Alnylam cannot successfully raise awareness of these underdiagnosed diseases and improve diagnosis rates, its commercial success will be limited.",13/02/2023,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is a pioneer in designing therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi, a mechanism that occurs naturally in cells and silences overexpressed genes, which often cause protein misfolding and/or protein accumulation. Alnylam seeks to capitalize on the therapeutic potential of RNAi by creating small interfering RNA, or siRNA, that can treat diseases at the genetic level. When siRNA reaches its intended target, it can silence the gene that it contains code for, making it a potentially game-changing technology for difficult to treat diseases caused by genetic mutations. After over a decade of research, Onpattro, the first RNAi therapy, was approved in 2018 for polyneuropathy in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. This positioned Alnylam as a leader among RNA-based biotech companies. With the potential for label expansions into cardiomyopathy and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, we believe Alnylam has a large opportunity in ATTR amyloidosis with Onpattro and next-generation Amvuttra.  We believe Alnylam is one of only a few biotechnology companies with a systematic methodology for identifying targets and developing drug candidates. Alnylam currently has four marketed products and several late-stage candidates in its pipeline. In addition to Onpattro's 2018 approval, Alnylam received approval in 2019 for Givlaari for acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP. In 2020, Oxlumo was approved for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in all age groups. In June 2022, Alnylam received FDA approval for Amvuttra for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In December 2021, Leqvio received approval for high cholesterol, which was developed with Alnylam's partner Novartis under a license and collaboration agreement. Alnylam competes with a few other biotech companies that focus on RNA-based therapies, including Ionis, which received approval of Tegsedi for polyneuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis in 2018 about two months after Alnylam. Onpattro's safety profile is much more attractive since Tegsedi comes with a black-box warning as it has severe safety risks, but we expect both companies to produce next-generation candidates that could look more competitive.","We assign Alnylam a narrow moat rating based on the intangible assets from its RNA interference, or RNAi, technology and lengthy patents. Alnylam's proprietary technology specializes in RNAi, which uses small interfering RNA to silence malfunctioning genes. Its technology has led to a new class of therapies, which are prime for targeting rare diseases and other disorders caused by genetic mutations. Alnylam's RNAi technology platform has produced four marketed products since 2018 along with a growing and diverse pipeline, which support the companys intangible assets and narrow economic moat. In addition, Alnylam has lengthy patents for its drugs extending well past our explicit forecast period to 2035. We think it is highly likely that Alnylam will see returns above its cost of capital by 2031, and we model ROICs of nearly 38% in that year versus a 9% WACC. Even in our bear-case scenario, which is marked by a forecast diminished patient share, the failure of some drug candidates, and lower operating margins, we see ROICs steadily improving to 28% by 2030.Onpattro (patisiran) was approved in 2018 for polyneuropathy in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a rare, progressive disease characterized by the abnormal buildup of amyloid deposits in the bodys organs and tissues. Alnylam has a dominant position within the hATTR amyloidosis market, and it has been able to build upon its RNAi expertise to create a highly effective drug. One of Alnylam's primary competitors, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, competes in this space with its own RNA-based technology platform. Ionis' drug, Tegsedi (inotersen), was approved in late 2018 for polyneuropathy, about two months after the approval of Alnylam's Onpattro in the same indication. However, Tegsedi's efficacy comes with several severe side effects, and the label includes a black-box warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, which can be life-threatening and may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure. As a result, Ionis Tegsedi requires testing prior to treatment and frequent monitoring during treatment. Tegsedi is administered subcutaneously once weekly, but the black-box warning requires frequent blood and urine monitoring. In comparison, Alnylams Onpattro is administered every three weeks by intravenous infusion. The poor safety profile of Ionis Tegsedi has not made it competitive in polyneuropathy when matched with Onpattros much better safety profile and strong commercial success. We believe this illustrates the competitive edge of Alnylam's RNAi platform over Ionis' Tegsedi. However, Ionis is testing next-generation versions of Tegsedi that could improve upon this profile.Alnylam's other main competitor in ATTR amyloidosis is Pfizers Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (tafamidis), a small molecule that stabilizes the misfolded protein that causes the disease. Vyndaqel is currently approved in amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, while Alnylam's Onpattro and Ionis' Tegsedi are approved in polyneuropathy. Many ATTR amyloidosis patients may have both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy, and both are commonly mis- or underdiagnosed. Given this dynamic, we believe that the first competitor to gain approval in both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis (with solid efficacy and minimal side effects) has the best chance to garner patient share. Alnylam received FDA approval in 2022 for next-generation Amvuttra (vutrisiran) in ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and is also investigating vutrisiran in cardiomyopathy. Approval in cardiomyopathy would significantly increase the company's market opportunity in ATTR amyloidosis. Alnylam stands to compete with next-generation Amvuttra, which would be a quarterly subcutaneous injection as opposed to Onpattro's intravenous injection every three weeks.Regeneron and Intellia Therapeutics are co-developing an ATTR drug using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing components and presented data in June 2021 on their phase 1 study. An impressive 87% mean reduction in TTR at a high dose was reported; however, the data is very limited as this study only included six patients for just 28 days of assessment. However, key questions remain around the safety and long-term impact of gene-editing. A substantial amount of data involving hundreds of patients over extended periods of time will be needed to demonstrate the safety of gene-editing for ATTR amyloidosis. Alnylam already has a dominant position within the ATTR amyloidosis market, and we anticipate it will continue to have several years of further expansion into the market with the recent approval of Amvuttra and positive cardiomyopathy data for patisiran.Givlaari (givosiran) received FDA approval in November 2019 for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP. AHP is a family of rare, genetic diseases associated with distinct enzyme defects in the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver. Givlaari has also received approval in the EU and in several other countries, including Brazil, Canada, and Japan. AHP is a rare indication with a high unmet need, which allows for strong pricing power. At launch, Givlaaris average net cost per patient was over $440,000. AHP is characterized by attacks of pain and paralysis, and the symptoms can often to lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as viral gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and appendicitis. Alnylam has a U.S. gastrointestinal diseases education and promotional agreement to help raise awareness about AHP. Likewise, the company has also engaged with patient groups and communities. We expect diagnosis rates to improve with time, providing a tailwind for Givlaari's market penetration. In November 2020, Alnylam received approval for Oxlumo (lumasiran) in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Primary hyperoxaluria, or PH, is a group of rare genetic metabolic disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of oxalate in the kidneys and other organ systems of the body, which can result in kidney and liver failure. Alnylam has been expanding its global commercialization of Oxlumo with a launch underway in Germany, temporary authorization for use allowed in France, and marketing authorization approval in Brazil. Alnylam has pending regulatory filings for Oxlumo in other countries as well. Alnylam also has several partnered programs, where it would receive royalties or a share of the profits if the drug candidate is approved. Leqvio (inclisiran), partnered with Novartis and Blackstone, seeks to target hypercholesterolemia, or high cholesterol through a twice-yearly dosing by subcutaneous injection. Leqvio received EU approval in December 2020, and it has a PDUFA date in January 2022 for its U.S. approval. It is estimated that 40% of adults worldwide have high LDL cholesterol and 80% of high-risk patients do not achieve recommended LDL targets despite the use of statins. In its clinical development program, Leqvio provided an effective and maintained LDL cholesterol reduction of up to 52% in patients with elevated LDL, despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. We believe Leqvios efficacy looks competitive against statins, Amgens Repatha, and Regeneron and Sanofis Praluent. Repatha and Praluent use PCSK9 inhibitors, and while Leqvio also targets PCSK9 through RNAi, it offers the convenience of only a twice-a-year subcutaneous dose. In comparison, the recommended dosing for Repatha and Praluent is every two weeks or monthly subcutaneously. Alnylam is eligible to receive royalties up to 20% on Leqvios sales. Other partnered programs include fitusiran for hemophilia (phase 3; partnered with Sanofi), cemdisiran for IgA nephropathy, a complement-mediated disease (phase 2; partnered with Regeneron), and ALN-HBV02 for hepatitis B (partnered with VIR).","Alnylam deserves a high uncertainty rating. Its proprietary RNAi platform has churned out several late-stage candidates in a range of rare indications, but the success of the novel therapy class in more prevalent diseases is relatively unproven. The approval of Onpattro significantly derisked Alnylam's technology platform, and we don't see any lingering risks from previous issues, which includes the discontinuation of revusiran for cardiomyopathy due to a higher incidence of patient deaths during clinical trials (2016) and a patient death during clinical trials of fitusiran in hemophilia (2017). Alnylam is continuing to update its RNAi technology platform, rolling out improvements in efficacy and safety, yet the company's pipeline remains vulnerable to clinical trial missteps or safety issues.In addition to clinical development risks, we see some risks to Alnylam's commercialization strategy. The company is targeting several rare, underdiagnosed diseases such as cardiomyopathy in ATTR amyloidosis and acute hepatic porphyria. As is the case with most orphan diseases, if Alnylam cannot successfully raise awareness of these diseases and improve diagnosis rates, its commercial success will be limited. Additionally, other companies are pursuing RNA-based therapies. Despite Alnylam's notable progress, competitors such as Ionis, Dicerna, or Moderna could encroach on Alnylam's territory and target similar indications. Lastly, Alnylam hasn't yet reached profitability because of the high operating expenses associated with drug development and commercialization.Product governance is the main ESG risk, as failure to adhere to extensive regulations and quality management standards can lead to expensive recalls, increased regulatory scrutiny, compliance costs, and lawsuits from affected customers. Alnylam's valuation rests on its ability to maintain six-figure pricing and payers' willingness to continue reimbursement, which could be affected by shifts in healthcare drug policy.","We assign Alnylam a Standard capital allocation rating. Our analysis evaluates what we determine to be the three key facets of management decision-making from the perspective of shareholders: balance sheet strength, investment efficacy, and distributions. Our Standard rating results from a sound balance sheet, fair investment strategy, and an assessment of shareholder distributions as appropriate.Alnylam's balance sheet is sound, with revenue cyclicality and operating leverage each possessing a medium rating. The company is in decent financial health, thanks to its low debt levels and sizable cash on its balance sheet. As of year-end 2021, Alnylam held nearly $820 million in cash and equivalents and had a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.66.We view Alnylam's investment decisions as fair, with economic profit increasing throughout our explicit forecast period. Alnylam has continued to invest and improve upon its RNAi technology in order to bring innovative drugs to the market and expand its patient reach. We like management's focus on diversifying the company's pipeline to help ensure growth.Finally, we assess overall shareholder distributions as appropriate. Even though the company does not currently pay a dividend, we view this as appropriate since Alnylam is growing quickly and reinvesting in its drug development and commercialization efforts to help support its narrow moat.Alnylam's founding CEO, Dr. John Maraganore, retired at the end of 2021 and transitioned CEO leadership to Alnylams then-president and COO, Dr. Yvonne Greenstreet. Maraganore had been with Alnylam since its founding in 2002 and supported the leadership transition in a consulting capacity through the first quarter of 2022. He is also continuing to support Alnylam as a member of its Scientific Advisory Board. Greenstreet joined Alnylam in 2016 as COO and was promoted to president and COO in 2020. Greenstreet has more than 25 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and building businesses globally, including in the U.S. and Europe. Given her deep industry experience, we believe she is well qualified to lead Alnylam as CEO.The rest of the leadership team has served at several large biotech and pharmaceutical firms. We like the shareholder-friendly choice to separate the roles of CEO and chairman, with independent director Amy W. Schulman replacing Michael Bonney, who stepped down as chair in January 2023. Schulman was elected to the Alnylam board of directors in 2014 and has lengthy experience in the healthcare industry. Bonney will continue on the board as a nonindependent director. The board includes industry leaders in both biopharma and health insurance, former FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg, and company cofounder and Nobel laureate Phillip Sharp. ","Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is a leader in the study of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene expression. Alnylam has five drugs on the market: Onpattro and Amvuttra for hATTR amyloidosis, Givlaari for acute hepatic porphyria, Oxlumo for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, and Leqvio for hypercholesterolemia. It also has several clinical programs across various therapeutic areas: genetic medicines; cardio-metabolic diseases; hepatic infectious diseases, and CNS/ocular diseases. Upfront fees from research partnerships have boosted Alnylam's cash levels, and the company stands to see additional milestones and royalties from drugs commercialized under collaboration partnerships.","For a relatively early biotechnology company, Alnylam is in decent financial health. The approvals of Onpattro, Givlaari, Oxlumo, and Leqvio combined with several partnerships have bolstered Alnylam's cash balance, and the company concluded fiscal 2021 with nearly $820 million in cash and equivalents. With many late-stage trials and the continued commercial expansion of Oxlumo and Leqvio, we expect Alnylam to remain unprofitable until 2025 and that it will issue stock to raise capital during that period. We also expect collaboration partnerships, such as its agreement with Blackstone, to mitigate the hefty operating expenses required to put candidates through clinical development. Additionally, the 2019 FDA-approval of Givlaari and the 2020 FDA-approval of Oxlumo, which are wholly owned by Alnylam, should provide steady cash flow for the company.Alnylam has historically used debt sparingly, and it ended 2021 with $676 million in long-term debt.

24/11/2023,TE Connectivity Is the Largest Automotive Connector Supplier and Merits a Narrow Moat,TE Connectivity Ltd,TEL,3,01/11/2023,William Kerwin,131.33,USD,23/11/2023,135.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,01/11/2023,"We raise our fair value estimate for shares of narrow-moat TE Connectivity to $135, from $128, as we bake in expectations for a recovery in results beginning in fiscal 2024. Fiscal fourth-quarter results and fiscal first-quarter guidance were roughly in line with our model. TE is seeing pockets of weak demand in industrial equipment, heavy vehicles, and telecom customers, but we're encouraged by ongoing good results in automotive sales and growth for artificial intelligence, or AI, related sales. We think weak markets will last through the first half of 2024, but that TE can grow modestly in fiscal 2024 and see much more meaningful growth and margin expansion in fiscal 2025. We see shares as undervalued. September quarter sales dropped 7% year over year and rose 1% sequentially to $4.0 billion. We're pleased to see sequential growth, even as results throughout fiscal 2023 have been affected by weaker demand in certain markets. Automotive sales are the firm's primary growth driver, and rose nicely once again, capping off 6% growth for the fiscal year. We also liked seeing 16% sequential growth in TE's data and devices market, which has seen depressed demand from data center customers, but includes a small but growing exposure to AI. Non-GAAP operating margin was flat sequentially at 17.3% and down just 10 basis points year over year. TE has managed expenses well in a soft fiscal 2023, and we expect healthy non-GAAP operating margin around 18% for fiscal 2024. December quarter guidance calls for a mid-single-digit sequential sales decline to a midpoint of $3.85 billion, which we see reflecting normal seasonality. Thereafter, we expect sequential growth through fiscal 2024 behind continued electric vehicle adoption and recoveries in heavy vehicles and industrial equipment in the second half of the year. We see fiscal 2024 as a transition year, with more broad-based demand and stronger growth in fiscal 2025.","TE Connectivity is a leader in the automotive connector and sensor market, enabling OEMs to build more advanced and efficient electric and autonomous vehicles. TEs products are specialized for mission-critical applications in harsh environments, where reliable performance creates sticky customer relationships. TEs ongoing footprint consolidation should allow it to expand its midcycle operating margins and improve its cash flow.","Revenue concentration in the automotive and commercial transportation markets makes TE susceptible to downturns in production, as seen in 2020. TE relies on elevated R&D spending compared with competitors to maintain an innovation advantage. Any slowdown on its part or acceleration on the part of competitors may narrow the gap. TE has lower and more volatile operating profit margins than its primary peer, Amphenol, which signals suboptimal cost management, in our view.",01/11/2023,"TE Connectivity designs and manufactures connectors and sensors, supplying custom and semicustom solutions to a bevy of end markets in the transportation, industrial, and communications industries. TE has maintained a leading share of the global connector market for the last decade, specifically dominating the automotive connector market, from which it derives almost half of its revenue. While the firms entire business benefits from trends toward efficiency and connectivity, these are especially notable in cars, where shifts toward electric and autonomous vehicles provide lucrative opportunities for TE to sell into new vehicle sockets, like an onboard charger or advanced driver-assist system. TEs products offer high performance and reliability for mission-critical applications in harsh environments. As such, its customer relationships tend to be very sticky, with customers facing high financial and opportunity costs from switching to another component supplier, as well as the risk of component failure in new products. TEs customers also rely on the firm supplying cutting-edge products to power new capabilities in end applications. As older products become commoditized, the firm is able to maintain high prices with new innovations. As a result of these switching costs and pricing power, we believe TE possesses a narrow economic moat. In the future, we think TE will focus on increasing its dollar content in end applications across its end markets. TEs products pave the way for greater electrification and connectivity in vehicles, planes, and factories, which allows the firm to occupy a greater portion of these end products electrical architectures. We also think TE will remain a serial acquirer, bolting on smaller components players to expand its geographic and technological reach. We expect TE to continue expanding its midcycle gross and operating margins via footprint consolidation, as it streamlines the fixed-asset portfolio it has gained over a decade of acquisitions.","We assign TE Connectivity a narrow economic moat rating, based on intangible assets and switching costs. These moat sources lead to excess returns on invested capital that we expect to endure, more likely than not, for the next 10 years. We think switching costs are the primary moat source for advantaged components suppliers. Once a supplier's component is designed into an end application, it is likely to remain in for the product's entire lifecycle, ranging from one to two years in data centers, five to seven years in cars, and more than 10 years in aerospace applications. It is highly unlikely a customer would rip out and replace a component once designed in. Customer switching costs are tangible and include the time and cost of system redesign, retraining to learn and integrate the intricacies of a competitors proprietary technology, the lead time and expense of designing and testing the new system, the potential for disruption during production, and the purchase or relocation of heavy equipment or manufacturing. TE designs components into mission-critical systems like electric vehicle battery management systems, advanced driver-assistance systems, avionics systems, and power grids. These applications carry outsize costs to electrical failure, in our view. If theres electronic part failure in a consumer device like a smartphone or gaming console, it results in customer inconvenience and a potential loss of future sales for the original equipment manufacturer. If theres a similar failure in a mission-critical system, the results can be catastrophic, such as driver or passenger injury (and in the worst cases, death), or widespread power outages with knock-on adverse effects. With these high costs to failure as a backdrop, OEMs for these applications are highly risk-averse and require components to work flawlessly 100% of the time, no matter what the circumstance or context. As such, strong suppliers like TE Connectivity build components to withstand harsh environments like heat, cold, water, snow, ice, sand, dirt, intense vibration, electromagnetic interference, and even explosions, depending on the application. In our view, TE has earned the trust of risk-averse OEM customers across verticals with a flawless operating history, and its customers have a very high bar for switching away from a trusted incumbent supplier for mission-critical applications. We believe an additional facet of switching costs is derived from highly integrated relationships between TE and its customers. Once TE Connectivity wins a design, it takes on the role of a design partner, often moving a team of engineers onsite at a customer to build out the system in question. This adds an incumbent advantage. Both teams build relationships, share knowledge, and have experience from working on previous designs together. We contend these close relationships add an additional layer of stickiness to mission-critical products. We think that customers looking to build a new product iteration or model are more likely than not to choose incumbent TE Connectivity and avoid the time, cost, and risk of using a new supplier. TE Connectivity boasts strong design and engineering abilities, in our view, exhibiting intangible assets that supplement its moat. Nearly all electronic components are custom or semi-custom, with each customer using its own proprietary designs and needing specific requirements for components to fit in. TE has an expansive array of individual connectors and sensors at its disposal to design custom systems in collaboration with its customers. In cutting-edge applications like new vehicles and communications equipment, we posit that system requirements are constantly evolving, requiring new tweaks to electronic component content that incentivizes custom design. We think lower-value consumer applications are more standardized and less differentiated, but TE focuses on custom designs for cutting-edge applications that lead to pricing power in order to maintain strong gross margins and fend off lower-priced competition. TE Connectivitys research and development budget is focused on advancing new products that will enable new use cases at customers, like new high-voltage systems in an electric vehicle, or higher-speed data transfer in a data center or mobile network base station. We believe TEs technological portfolio would be difficult to replicate by a new entrant or an existing smaller competitor. Furthermore, its parts are hard to rip out once embedded with a customer, especially for mission-critical applications. This combination leads to strong returns on invested capital and our narrow economic moat rating.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to TE Connectivity. TE must constantly innovate and refresh its product portfolio to avoid commodification and maintain its competitive advantage. With over half of its sales into the transportation marketand more than 40% of revenue coming from autoTEs revenue and profits can be vulnerable to fluctuations and cycles in global automotive production. While the firms consistent ability to outgrow its underlying market through content growth provides a slight hedge to downturns, 2020 showed the limits to this hedge when a precipitous downturn occurs in the global automotive market.TE also faces risks arising from its expansive global manufacturing footprint. With its revenue evenly split among the American, European, and Asian markets, significant foreign-exchange fluctuations could affect TEs results. Additionally, any trade disputes or restrictions may hamper TEs ability to sell into certain parts of the world. Nevertheless, given that TEs products are more basicand thus far more removed from the national security spotlightthan semiconductors, and that the company's domiciled in neutral Switzerland, we think the risk of tariffs or trade restrictions is muted.TE faces the threat of consolidation of its competitors in the electrical component industry. If two firms like Amphenol and Molex were to merge, they would form a behemoth surpassing TE in size and potentially eat into TEs moat. However, this consolidation typically features small to medium-size bolt-on deals for other leading players and not industry-dynamic-shifting mergers. TE also drives this consolidation itself, completing several bolt-on acquisitions a year to expand its breadth and maintain its market share pole position. We dont foresee substantial environmental, social, or governance risk for TE Connectivity. The firm has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030.","We assign TE Connectivity a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think TEs balance sheet is sound, based on very low net debt/EBITDA and net debt to our estimate of enterprise value. We also think TE returns an appropriate amount of capital to shareholders. The management team aims to return two thirds of free cash flow to shareholders, with one third funding the dividend and the other third used for opportunistic share repurchases. However, management often exceeds this goal when it doesnt find value-accretive alternative uses for its cash. With the remaining third of its free cash flow, TE conducts opportunistic acquisitions, which we assess as fair. These acquisitions mostly are bolt-ons of smaller connector and sensor firms that give TE a new capability or allow it to penetrate a new market, like the $230 million purchase of First Sensor in 2020 that brought low-pressure sensing technology as well as a foothold in the German market. Overall, we think management has done a good job over the past decade in aligning TEs portfolio to high-growth markets in its core competencies of efficiency and connectivity in harsh environments. It entered the medical market in 2016 with the $1.3 billion acquisition of Creganna and sold its legacy subsea communications business in 2019 for $297 million. It also conducted a five-year exit from the mobile devices business, which featured volatile revenue and little leverage for suppliers. While we think TE couldve generated additional cash from selling this business, we still believe it is effectively pivoting its core business in the right direction.","TE Connectivity is the largest electrical connector supplier in the world, supplying interconnect and sensor solutions to the transportation, industrial, and communications markets. With operations in 150 countries and over 500,000 stock-keeping units, TE has a broad portfolio that forms the electrical architecture of its end customers' cutting-edge innovations.","We expect TE Connectivity to remain leveraged, using strong free cash flow to invest organically and inorganically and to send capital back to shareholders. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the firm carried $4.2 billion in total debt and $1.7 billion in cash on hand. While the firm is leveraged, we think its cash flow generation will be more than able to fulfill its obligations. TE has less than $600 million a year in payments due through fiscal 2028, and we project it to generate more than $2 billion in free cash flow annually over the next five years. Even in a severely soft macroenvironment in 2020, the firm generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow. After TE fulfills its obligations, we expect it to use the remainder of its cash to maintain its dividend and conduct share repurchases. We think the firm will remain leveraged, using extra capital for opportunistic acquisitions while using its heady cash flow to pay off its principal and interest.",TEL,Technology,41022828544.0,NYQ,1345405.0,USD,131.3300018310547,True,0,127.80247048770705,138.66876578625062,1

Our multistage DCF valuation incorporates five years of explicit projections for a fixed period, typically five years. Terminal values are derived by assuming firms eventually earn their cost of capital in perpetuity. This contrasts with our previous methodology, which modeled the harvesting of all company assets over a 30-year timeframe. The change brings our E&P valuations in line with Morningstars standard equity research methodology. For an industry facing secular decline, it might seem counterintuitive to switch to a perpetuity method. However, we maintain our long-held view that oil and gas demand will keep growing in the short run before slowly declining over a multidecade horizon. We agree that electric vehicles and renewables are effective substitutes for oil and gas, respectively, but light-duty vehicles account for less than half of crude consumption and there are no viable alternatives for the remainder (aviation, shipping, and petrochemicals). And natural gas will remain a core part of the energy mix for many years yet, initially taking share from coal that is still widely used for electric power generation. As production from existing wells declines quickly, the industry will have to keep developing oil and gas reserves to meet this persistent demand, and firms should receive credit for the ability to continue generating returns as a result (even when their current inventories are exhausted). Because our multistage DCF now implicitly incorporates this, the fair value estimate impact is typically positive (with an average increase of 5%-10%). Even after the increases, bargains in the industry are scarce. Our top picks are low-cost leader Diamondback and APA, which appears to have strong growth potential in as-yet undeveloped Suriname. Price/fair value ratios for the two are 0.89 and 0.78, respectively.","EOG is among the most technically proficient operators in the business. Initial production rates from its shale wells consistently exceed industry averages. EOG avoids expensive M&A and uses its proven exploration acumen to identify new prospects before the rest of the industry cottons on and bids up land prices. Having assets in multiple basins enables EOG to shift capital as market conditions dictate, prioritizing oil or gas volumes as appropriate and sidestepping areas where well costs have overheated.","The premium portion of EOG's inventory could run out after 10-15 years if the company fails to replace the locations it drills with new opportunities. EOG uses special dividends to return excess cash to shareholders, rather than a more transparent and predictable method. EOG's scale is a double-edged sword; it must work harder to maintain a larger production base and drilling inventory.",31/08/2023,"EOG is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers. Most of its production comes from U.S. shale fields, with a small contribution from Trinidad. The firm differentiates itself by finding prospective areas before peers catch on, enabling it to secure leasehold at attractive rates, rather than overpaying for land after the market overheats. It has only one large-scale M&A deal under its belt, related to its 2016 entry to the Permian Basin. Nevertheless, the firm is also active in most other name-brand shale plays, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Additionally, the focus now includes the Powder River Basin and a new natural gas play in southern Texas called Dorado. Like the rest of the industry, EOG has embraced capital discipline and aims to return at least 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, with special dividends to augment the regular payout. However, unlike most peers, management is not afraid to invest in moderate production growth as well. The firm has historically prioritized drilling locations that management designates ""premium"" (expected to generate internal rates of return of at least 30%, assuming $40 per barrel WTI and $2.50 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas). And in the next 10 years the firm will mainly stick to a ""double premium"" subset, which offers twice the returns under the same conditions. Opportunities that dont meet this criteria may be upgraded, if the company can reduce the expected development cost or boost the expected output. For several years, EOG has added more premium locations than it drilled. Due to its size and wide focus, EOG has significantly more shale wells under its belt than most peers. This has enabled it to advance more quickly up the learning curve in each play. As a result, initial production rates from new wells are usually well above industry averages (though subsequent declines are usually steeper as wellEOG isn't necessarily producing more oil from each well, but is recovering the available volumes more quickly, boosting profitability). Its scale enables it to outsource less and gives it more bargaining power with suppliers, which is particularly helpful during periods of high inflation.","Until recently, very few shale producers were paying attention to shareholder returns, but EOG was one of them. The firm actually delivered excess returns on invested capital for five of the six years of 2009-14, before the downturn in global crude prices began. That pushed returns back in negative territory for several years. But a relentless focus on cost-cutting, productivity, and efficiency eventually paid off, enabling EOG to start earning its cost of capital again and qualifying the firm for a narrow moat rating.Management has achieved this by focusing on what it calls premium drilling locations--those it believes would earn a 30% internal rate of return at $40/bbl WTI and $2.50/mcf natural gas. The location of a horizontal shale well plays a huge part in determining its eventual productivity and also influences the oil content of its production stream. EOGs acreage is mainly located in areas that typically yield very impressive initial flow rates and strong oil cuts, giving the company a clear cost advantage.EOGs inventory contains over 10,000 net drilling locations that meet managements premium criteria. As it stands, thats enough to support 10-15 years of further activity. But thats a bare minimum estimate: The firm is establishing a record of upgrading nonpremium locations (of which it has several thousand more) to meet the criteria. By tweaking well parameters in nonpremium areas to raise productivity expectations, or by lowering costs through efficiency gains, it can add premium locations without spending capital. In most years, the firm adds more premium locations than it drills (without making acquisitions).More recently, management has pivoted again and the current focus is ""double premium"" drilling locations. These are expected to deliver twice the returns at the same commodity prices. The firm has identified a significant subset of premium locations that qualify as double premium and these will be the backbone of the firm's activity in the next decade. And as it did with its premium inventory from 2016-21, the firm expects to add locations to its double premium drilling queue faster than it uses them up.Strong acreage isnt the only reason that EOG wells outperform industry norms. Trial and error enables shale producers to optimize the design of their wells, enhancing productivity over time. As one of the largest shale companies, EOG has access to a more complete database and is able to better optimize the completion process to drive superior performance. As a technical leader, it can rely more on third parties mainly for equipment rather than technical expertise (enabling it to control costs by utilizing more mom-and-pop suppliers). But these advantages arent necessarily maintainable, and other companies can theoretically catch up as they climb the learning curve. It is the land itself that EOG has already locked up that forms the basis of its economic moat, because this advantage cannot be replicated.The firm has a long history in the shale patch, starting with the Barnett Shale, which it was developing in 2004. That play is one of the earliest examples of an unconventional field made profitable through advances like fracking and, later, horizontal drilling. EOG also entered the Bakken Shale at a very early stage in the basins development, and by 2010 it was already active in most of the areas it is developing today. By being an early mover, the company was able to keep acquisition costs under control, giving it a maintainable advantage over peers that rushed in later and overpaid.EOG deviated only once from this strategy of getting in early and avoiding lofty premiums, when it purchased Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion in 2016. Even then, the transaction took place at the low point of the commodity cycle, presumably resulting in more favorable terms for EOG than it would have otherwise ended up with. In any case, no further deals are expected. Management usually seeks to avoid large-scale acquisitions, and as the company has already assembled enough premium and double premium inventory to keep it busy for at least 10 years, theres no need to extend the portfolio.The company also benefits from a high degree of vertical integration. In addition to gathering structure, EOG has its own sand mine to supply proppant for fracking. It was also the first upstream company to bring completion design in-house, giving it more control over the cost of each well, and it supplies its own water, tubular goods, chemicals, and drilling mud as well. It is therefore less beholden to the service industry and can utilize more low-cost mom-and-pop suppliers for its third-party equipment needs.Further, though the firm does have exposure to potential environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues that could threaten its moat, we do not see enough of a threat to consider a downgrade at this time. For all E&P firms, the most significant ESG exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (both from extraction operations and downstream consumption), and other emissions, effluents, and waste (primarily oil spills).Greenhouse gas emissions are unavoidable for oil producers. Firms can clean up their operations in the field as much as possible by avoiding unnecessary flaring and using technologies like electric fracking and carbon capture to reduce CO2 volumes being released into the atmosphere during the extraction process. EOG has already drastically reduced its greenhouse gas emissions rate and is close to eliminating routine flaring altogether, and it has begun investing in carbon capture and storage projects that could help offset its downstream (scope 3) emissions as well. Nevertheless, as consumers get more averse to fossil fuels, the reputational risk grows for all producers and the probability of widespread substitution away from fossil fuels increases. This also makes value-destructive regulatory intervention more likely (think fracking restrictions or carbon taxes). Of course, legislation that threatens EOG would most likely hurt its peers as well, rather than reshuffling the cost curve. We'd expect EOG to preserve its competitive edge.In contrast, spills are not a major concern for EOG. The firm does have some offshore operations - in Trinidad - but this is a very small part of the portfolio and the wells primarily output natural gas, with minimal crude. So there is very little chance of a devastating accident like the BP Macondo disaster in 2010. Nor would the firm be on the hook for adverse events during long-haul transit onshore, like the Kalamazoo River (Michigan) spill, which also occurred in 2010. This activity is typically outsourced to midstream firms that operate regional pipelines. Instead, as an onshore producer the firm is vulnerable to spills at or around the wellsite. These tend to be frequent, but relatively minor. Costly legal challenges are unlikely for this kind of event and we see little chance of significant value destruction.","As with most E&P firms, a deteriorating outlook for oil and natural gas prices would pressure this firms profitability, reduce cash flows, and drive up financial leverage. An increase to federal taxes, or a revocation of the intangible drilling deduction that U.S. firms enjoy, could also impact profitability and reduce our fair value estimates.Material ESG exposures create additional risk for E&P investors. In this industry, the most significant exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (both from extraction operations and downstream consumption), and other emissions, effluents, and waste (primarily oil spills). In additional to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as fracking bans, drilling permit suspensions, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions.EOG's very strong balance sheet and low leverage offsets the general volatility of oil markets. Accordingly, we assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.","Our Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating reflect's EOG's robust balance sheet, impressive investment strategy (avoiding corporate M&A and instead using its scale and technical savvy to build an extensive low-cost asset portfolio), and appropriate distributions. The firm has steadily grown its dividend since at least 2008 and is likely to keep generating more than enough cash to cover the payout (even if maintains annual increases of 10%).EOG was one of the first firms in our coverage to focus on delivering returns to shareholders, and has done so in most years since inception (1999). Employee compensation, including management, depends heavily on returns on capital employed. Unlike ROIC, this metric overstates profitability because it does not incorporate asset write-downs, which occur periodically in the oil and natural gas industry (EOG reported more than $6 billion of impairments in 2015 alone). However, ROCE is still a better yardstick than production or EBITDA growth. Maximizing ROCE, and thus ROIC, is engrained into the culture at EOG.","EOG Resources is an oil and gas producer with acreage in several U.S. shale plays, including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken. At the end of 2022, it reported net proved reserves of 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net production averaged 908 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022 at a ratio of 73% oil and natural gas liquids and 27% natural gas.","Overall, EOG's financial health is excellent compared with peers. The firm has built a net cash position, and its debt/capital ratio is 23%. It has the ability to generate more cash than it spends in the field, under a wide range of commodity scenarios and could tolerate a prolonged oil market downturn if necessary. Management aims to retain its substantial cash cushion to enable it to take advantage of downcycles by repurchasing stock without unduly stressing the balance sheet at an inopportune time.",EOG,Energy,72077344768.0,NYQ,2985313.0,USD,123.16999816894533,True,1,128.21364647360002,117.61061670750493,0
24/11/2023,Insulet Poised for Boost From U.S. Launch of Omnipod 5,Insulet Corp,PODD,4,03/11/2023,Debbie Wang,186.31,USD,23/11/2023,234.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,03/11/2023,"Insulet generated stellar third-quarter results that slightly exceeded our full-year expectations on the top and bottom lines. However, our fair value estimate is unchanged because our modest increases to revenue and gross margin assumptions were offset by the revised share count. Shares have become significantly undervalued in the last few months, as investors speculate about how widespread use of GLP-1s might hurt Insulets pump business. Despite that uncertainty, we were struck that management raised its outlook for the third time this year, especially considering the third and fourth quarters of 2022 had seen significant acceleration in sales growth, thanks to the rollout of Omnipod 5. We expect Insulet can maintain this strength in 2024 related to several new drivers. This quarter demonstrated the intangible assets that underpin Insulets narrow economic moat, as well as the top-flight commercial execution that has allowed the firm to shine.  Quarterly total revenue growth of 25% in constant currency was fueled by 35% U.S. Omnipod growth. This is nothing to sneeze at, considering the prior-year period itself had racked up 42% U.S. Omnipod growth on the introduction of Omnipod 5. We anticipate further 24% top-line growth in 2024, as the new IOS app becomes available and the pumps automated insulin delivery is integrated with Dexcoms new G7 continuous glucose monitorboth expected to roll out in early 2024. Commercialization continues for Omnipod 5 in Germany and the ramp up of Omnipod Go, the basal-only pump aimed at another section of the type 2 diabetes market. All of these developments bode well for Insulet next year. Insulets strong showing in the third quarter and weakness at rival Tandem suggest the latter is bearing the brunt of competitive pressure from Insulet. Compared with Insulets quarterly U.S. Omnipod growth, Tandem saw its U.S. revenue decline 11% year over year, including those patients who plan to switch over to the upcoming Mobi pump.","We see global growth for the insulin pump market, as Type 1 diabetics embrace continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for its lower rate of long-term diabetes-related complications. Insulet created the first (and still only) tubeless insulin pump on the U.S. market for the Type 1 market and has a head start on the manufacturing learning curves. With makers of continuous glucose monitors focused on converting the much larger type 2 diabetes population, Insulet has benefited as some of these patients also opt to adopt an insulin pump.","With only one product and low switching costs for customers, Insulet is very vulnerable if larger competitors produce similar or superior tubeless insulin pumps. When consumers pull back on spending, we've seen some diabetic patients put off purchases of more discretionary devices such as insulin pumps when manual injections provide adequate blood glucose control. Once Medtronic manages to launch its next-gen 780g pump in the U.S., this could soften demand for Insulet's Omnipod 5.",01/03/2023,"With little direct competition in patch pumps, Insulet has been able to convert more users to its innovative, tubeless insulin pump. We expect meaningful profitability gains over the next five years.  Until Insulet's Omnipod came on the market at the end of 2005, all insulin pumps consisted of a controller and insulin reservoir attached to the injection site by a long flexible tube. The Omnipod design eliminates the tubing, consolidating the insulin reservoir and a self-inserting cannula into a single pod, less than the size of a deck of cards, which is controlled by a wireless remote. The system is inconspicuous and easy to use and has so far been very successful among patients new to insulin pumps. These patients represent lots of growth potential, as an estimated 60% of Americans with Type 1 diabetes still take daily insulin injections. The user-friendly Omnipod has been particularly successful among children and teens.  After a major management changeover in 2014-15, Insulet has improved its manufacturing and commercialization strategies and has made progress in gaining economies of scale to bring down costs, while enlarging its user base. We like Insulet's decisions to shift to direct distribution in Europe and expand capacity by investing in a highly automated manufacturing facility in the United States. Both moves have shown up in margin expansion. Insulet is currently enjoying adoption of its Omnipod 5 pump, which is controlled by smartphone. The Omnipod 5 also represents Insulet's entrance into hybrid closed-loop technology that makes life easier by automating insulin delivery through parts of the day. This new product brings Insulet up to par with Medtronic and Tandem's current pumps, which already offer the hybrid closed-loop technology. But, the unique tubeless design of Omnipod offers a qualitatively different patient experience. Finally, a larger rival like Medtronic or Abbott might be interested in acquiring Insulet. Insulet's differentiated design has spurred above-market growth, which could be attractive to potential buyers looking to round out their diabetes portfolios.","Since Insulet received Food and Drug Administration approval on its novel Omnipod insulin patch pump in 2005, weve carefully monitored its commercial performance and long held that the technology held potential for a moat. Now that Insulet has cultivated a largely stable base of users and has demonstrated its ability to roll out further innovation, were giving Insulet a narrow economic moat rating, which reflects our belief that the firm is more likely than not to deliver normalized excess returns over the next decade. We think Insulets narrow moat stems from intangible assets, which include intellectual property, materials engineering expertise in the somewhat fickle shape memory alloy technology, as well as experience in manufacturing these complicated devices. Consumable patch pumps are trickier to manufacture than traditional ""tubed"" insulin pumps, partly because there are more components in the patch pump that offer more opportunities for things to go wrong. We saw some of these manufacturing quality issues surface in 2013-14 when Insulet launched its redesigned Omnipod that was 30% smaller and initiated new manufacturing lines in its Chinese facility to meet increased demand for the product. Production problems resulted in greater levels of scrap, increased Omnipod failures for patients, disappointing gross margin, and ultimately, management change.Insulet currently possesses 260 patents in the U.S. and other key markets, and has filed for another 250 that cover the products design, cannula insertion mechanism, software, and the shape memory alloy drive system. It is this last element that we believe is most critical as its an ingenious application of smart metal technology that expands and contracts to turn gears that drive the plunger and release insulin (versus any sort of motor-based mechanism). We believe this shape memory alloy system is partly what has made it difficult for competitors to create something similar, as this technology is known for some of its limitations (for example, low durability) that have kept it from more extensive commercial applications. Medtronic had expressed interest in developing a competitive patch pump a decade ago, but after several years of working on it, the firm turned its attention to furthering the technology of its traditional tubed insulin pump to increase the automation of its products. Medtronic possesses a great deal of expertise in tubed insulin pumps, as evidenced by its market-leading series of Minimed pumps over roughly two decades. However, motors have driven these pumps. We suspect a motor-driven patch pump, if it could be engineered, would fall far short of the Omnipod, and Medtronic likely didnt have the expertise to engineer a solution based on shape memory alloy technology. Most recently, Medtronic management suggested development of a patch pump is a long-term goal. However, we see considerable challenges if Medtronic goes down this path. Considering that Medtronic has more attractive near-term prospects in its progress toward closing the loop, we don't expect the firm to pose much of a threat to Insulet's niche in the foreseeable future. Additionally, Insulet has made the most of the last 10 years by significantly increasing its patient user base and upgrading its technology.We note that there are a few other patch pumps available. However, they do not automatically release a basal rate of insulin throughout the day as the Omnipod does, thus are not suited for the Type 1 patient population that uses Omnipod. Competitive patch pumps mainly contain fast-acting insulin for Type 2 patients to discreetly deliver a bolus following a meal, for example, by manually turning a dial. These are less sophisticated devices that primarily serve to conveniently carry insulin on the body.Secondarily, we think there is a degree of patient loyalty to the Omnipod thanks to its tubeless design. The tubeless pump experience is materially different from the tubed pump experience for patients. Omnipod is stuck directly on the body for three days at a time, the waterproof design means the patient can bathe or swim without any worry or disconnecting from the pump. On the other hand, a traditional tubed pump such as those Medtronic and Tandem make is not waterproof because of its motor feature. The patient must disconnect each time for bathing or swimming. The tube also means patients often have to cut holes in their clothing to accommodate the tube, wear clothes with belt loops to clip the pump to, and still end up getting the tubing snagged on furniture or knobs. Omnipods tubeless design is particularly well-suited for the pediatric market. As these children grow up, we expect most will want to stick to the tubeless pump that they are accustomed to.While we think intellectual property is helpful for keeping competitors from getting too close to the specifications of the Omnipod, we also recognize that among medical technology products, innovation cycles are often quick and new products are commonly commercialized even before existing patents have run their course. For this reason, we think Insulets track record for rolling out new and improved technology is a significant factor in its narrow moat. Since receiving FDA approval in 2005, Insulet has embarked on one major product redesign in 2013 that substantially improved wearability, and reduced product size and cost. In 2020, Insulet was focused on marketing Omnipod Dash, which comes with an updated handheld controller and contains an additional feature that allows for patients (and their parents) to monitor blood glucose and insulin data on smartphones. Most recently, Insulet received FDA approval on its own hybrid closed-loop Omnipod 5 in 2022, which will include the ability to control the pump from an Apple smartphone and offer integration with Dexcom's G6 continuous glucose monitor. This puts Insulet in a strong position to compete in a field where hybrid closed-loop technology is becoming the standard.In terms of environmental, social, and governance matters, Sustainalytics rates Insulet as medium risk exposure and we concur. The biggest risk revolves around the potential for product defects. While insulin pumps are not quite equivalent to life-saving devices such as pacemakers or heart valves, problems with product performance could lead to patient injury. Some of Insulet's products are approved through the 510(k) process, which offers less protection from legal liability than the premarket approval pathway. While Insulet hasn't run into any product recalls, the firm's heavy reliance on the Omnipod product means any potential recall would have a material effect on cash flow in the near term. However, we are less convinced a defective product would necessarily impair the firm's narrow economic moat, as most defective devices can be addressed with new engineering solutions relatively quickly. Moreover, Insulet continues to be the only competitor with a tubeless patch pump--a point of differentiation that is meaningful.","Based on the higher-than-average volatility of cash flows and Insulet's heavy reliance on a single product, we rate the firm's uncertainty as high.Insulet's main danger comes from well-financed competitors like Medtronic and Abbott, which already possess large salesforces and relationships with medical professionals. The launch of Medtronic's 670g pump was a significant step toward closing the loop, and the next-generation 780g pump will come even closer to replicating automatic pancreatic function, which could offer tougher competition to Insulet. Like other medical device and equipment companies, Insulet ultimately will need to keep innovating beyond its next-generation product. Considering the relatively discretionary nature of insulin pumps, Insulet remains vulnerable to economic downturns when consumers tighten their financial belts and stick with multiple daily injections.","We think Insulet has earned an Exemplary capital allocation rating, reflecting sound balance sheet management, exceptional investment practices, as well as appropriate shareholder distributions.From an investment perspective, we applaud management's decisions that have delivered value on its investment strategy as well as on execution. Insulet has beefed up manufacturing capacity with lower costs (and better control over quality), enlarged the salesforce to support commercialization and expanding access across different distribution channels, and ramped up R&D to support development of mobile apps, indication expansion, predictive algorithms, integration with CGMs, and a hybrid closed-loop system. Most recently, the firm put a third manufacturing line into place in the U.S. and also a new one in China. Considering the firm has been somewhat constrained in its commercialization of recent technology due to capacity, we anticipate this expansion should allow the firm to better meet demand.In terms of shareholder distributions, Insulet does not pay a dividend, nor does it consistently engage in share repurchases, which we think is appropriate. The firm is still in the relatively early stages of commercialization, and reinvestment of proceeds into the business--R&D, manufacturing, and the commercial organization--offer the best opportunities for increasing shareholder value, from our perspective.We were disappointed to see Shacey Petrovic step down from the CEO post, as her work juggling manufacturing, reimbursement, investments in R&D, and execution from the commercial organization were impressive. New CEO Jim Hollingshead brings extensive medtech and strategy experience from his time at ResMed, though. Executive compensation is tied to revenue and operating profit growth, as well as customer retention--this last is an operational measure that we think could help ensure the firm does not lose sight of customer service and relationship goals.","Insulet was founded in 2000 with the goal of making continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for diabetes easier to use. The result was the Omnipod system, which consists of a small disposable insulin infusion device and that can be operated through a smartphone to control dosage. Since the Omnipod was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005, approximately 360,000 insulin-dependent diabetics are using it worldwide.","Thanks to a series of equity and debt offerings, Insulet has managed to buy time in the race to expand its sales base and reach profitability before running out of cash. As of the end of December, Insulet held $675 million in cash and short-term investments and owed roughly $1.4 billion in convertible debt outstanding. The next portion of debt comes due in 2026 ($800 million in principal that converts to equity at a price of $226.73). With shares recently trading in near $279, the 2026 notes are in the money. We expect Insulet should consistently generate free cash flow now that it's turned the corner on profitability, so it may not need to access external financing to continue operating in the intermediate term. However, we'll keep a close eye out for any competitive launch prospects, which could spook equity and credit investors alike, as a compelling alternative to Insulet's patch pump could cut into cash flow prospects in the long run.",PODD,Healthcare,13427162112.0,NMS,928368.0,USD,186.3099975585937,True,1,180.26976470946937,192.50382675359506,1
24/11/2023,Clover Can Drive Growth at Fiserv,Fiserv Inc,FI,4,24/10/2023,Brett Horn,125.45,USD,23/11/2023,135.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,24/10/2023,"Fiserv produced another strong quarter, with organic growth accelerating a bit sequentially and the company continuing to see strong margin improvement. Revenue grew 8% year over year, or 12% on an organic basis. With Fiserv tracking ahead of expectations, management modestly lifted its 2023 guidance. We will maintain our $135 fair value estimate for the narrow-moat company and see shares as undervalued at the moment. The acceptance segment remains the main driver of growth, with revenue growth accelerating to 20% year over year on an organic basis. Some of this growth appears to be due to transitory macro factors in Latin America, but underlying growth looks healthy. The Clover business saw growth pick up a bit in the quarter to 26%. We remain impressed with Clovers performance and continue to see Clover as the best example of how leading players can successfully adapt and coopt changes in the payments industry. The fintech and payments segments both posted 6% year-over-year growth on an organic basis. For fintech, this represented an improvement from previous quarters, but growth for the full year is likely to be roughly in line with our long-term expectations. We dont expect much growth for this business but appreciate the strong and stable profitability it produces. The payments business saw growth decelerate this quarter but will likely finish the year ahead of our long-term expectations and is enjoying some regulatory tailwinds at the moment. The companys relatively strong growth appears to be positively impacting margins. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter improved to 38.1% from 35.2% last year. For the first nine months, adjusted operating margin is up 250 basis points, and managements full-year guidance is an improvement of at least 175 basis points. We think the scalable nature of Fiservs business should allow for margin improvement over time, but we expect the long-term improvement to be much more modest.","The bank technology business is very stable, characterized by high amounts of recurring revenue and long-term contracts. The ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created and will continue to create room for acquirers to see solid growth without stealing share from each other. First Datas growth had accelerated before the merger as it worked past its financial issues, and the business now has access to greater resources under Fiservs roof.","Since it was built through acquisitions, Fiserv has to maintain multiple core processing platforms, which could limit margins and hamper the quality of its offerings. Fiservs bank technology operations are tied to a mature industry and almost entirely domestic, which limits its growth prospects. First Data underperformed peers over the past decade, and a focus on cost reduction could perpetuate that underperformance.",29/09/2023,"Fiservs merger with First Data in 2019 kicked off a string of three similar deals that took place in short order. We dont believe Fiservs move was especially attractive relative to the other two, and we dont believe the company materially strengthened its competitive position as a result. However, we do think there was a valid strategic rationale for these deals. First Data had been a laggard compared with peers over the past decade, as it was overwhelmed by an excessive debt load due to a leveraged buyout just before the financial crisis and the defection of a major bank partner. We believe this meaningfully limited its ability to reinvest and adapt in an industry that continues to evolvie. However, the company worked its leverage down to a more manageable level, and growth improved, suggesting its issues are not structural. With financial health no longer a concern, we think the stage was set for First Data to narrow the growth gap with peers. While First Data remains relatively reliant on its banking partners, initiatives such as Clover suggest it is capable of adjusting to a changing industry. Clover, the companys small-business solution that has similarities to Squares offering, has seen strong growth, with volume running at an annualized rate of about $200 billion. This is a drop in the bucket relative to overall volume, but Clover enjoys much stronger pricing and is the type of platform we think the company needs to keep overall growth in line with the industry.  The COVID-19 pandemic did illustrate one negative of this merger: The acquiring business is significantly more macro-sensitive than Fiservs legacy operations. But payment volume has steadily improved and returned to strong year-over-year growth. Unless the economic environment takes a sharp negative turn, the long-term secular tailwind appears to be reasserting itself and the worst seem to be past the industry. Over the long term, the acquiring operations should be the company's strongest engine for growth. Further, with the company's closest peer on the acquiring side in a bit of disarray, there could be some near-term opportunities for Fiserv.","While we believe certain aspects of Fiservs business benefit from a wide moat, the companys operations have expanded to a point where we believe a narrow moat rating is appropriate for the business as a whole. Fiservs roots lie in core processing systems, the most basic and mission-critical system for banks, and this business is contained in the companys financial segment, which makes up about 20% of revenue. Core processing is the nuts-and-bolts system that banks need to maintain their deposit and loan accounts and to post daily transactions. Given the integral nature of core processing to their operations, banks very rarely switch systems. Besides the potential for interruptions, converting to a new system would require the banks to retrain employees. Customers typically sign multiyear contracts, and customer retention approaches 99% annually, excluding customers lost because of acquisitions by another bank. Fiservs leading market share also provides an edge in this scalable business. Fiserv's sticky customer relationships and cost advantages add up to a wide economic moat for this segment, in our opinion.Fiservs bank offerings have widened significantly over the years, and services related to payment processing now outstrip the financial segment in terms of revenue, with the companys payments segment now making up almost 40% of revenue. We believe that this area of the business also enjoys meaningful switching costs, but that the switching costs are not nearly as high as for core processing. In our opinion, cost advantage is a more meaningful factor in this area. Payment processing of any type tends to be highly scalable, and Fiserv enjoys a leading position in processing debit and credit payments for issuers. However, it does not appear to have a dominant edge in terms of volume, and we believe only a narrow moat surrounds this segment of the business.With its merger with First Data in 2019, Fiserv expanded into merchant acquiring, and the acceptance segment, which contains these operations, makes up about 40% of revenue. We believe that switching costs are relatively low in this area, and that scale and the resulting cost advantage are the dominant factor in terms of competitive positioning. As a result, a handful of acquirers have come to dominate the industry over time, and mergers and acquisitions in recent years have further consolidated the space. However, First Data remained a leader and enjoys a sizable market share lead with about 40% of the U.S. market if its bank joint ventures are included. At the same time, we think this joint venture structure is a potential source of weakness from a moat perspective as the companys scale advantage depends on its bank partners. The joint venture with Chase dissolved about a decade ago, and the Bank of America joint venture recently dissolved, although the companies will continue to service existing clients through at least 2023. Excluding bank joint ventures, volume is on par with that of FIS. Overall, we think a narrow moat is appropriate for this part of the business.All of Fiserv's business benefits from limited capital needs, and the company produces strong ROICs as a result. Excluding goodwill, ROIC has averaged 24% over the past five years.","Any weaknesses in the banking sector could lead banks to defer technology purchases, hurting Fiserv's top line, and any dramatic changes in the structure of the banking industry could have hard-to-predict consequences for Fiserv. Aging core processing systems and increased needs for system flexibility could lead to higher replacement rates over time and possibly erode the companys moat.The payment processing industry is evolving, and while the position of the acquirers in the current dominant framework is well established, it is possible that future disruption could lower the profitability the industry can generate or cut the acquirers out altogether. As the companys revenue is directly tied to revenue at its merchant customers, Fiservs acquiring operations are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.We see the company's largest ESG risk as data security. Historically, the industry has experienced significant system breaches at times, which creates event risk. The risk of breaches is likely higher on the acquiring side, but a breach on the bank technology side could have greater consequences. Finally, management has historically been willing to pursue large-scale acquisitions, which could lead to integration risk and high financial leverage at certain points.","Our capital allocation rating for Fiserv is Standard. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.Jeff Yabuki took over as CEO in 2005 after cofounder Leslie Muma retired. Yabuki stepped down at the start of July 2020, and Frank Bisignano, who had previously headed First Data, took over as CEO.We think Yabuki charted a new course for the company in a couple of main ways. Fiserv has completed over 100 acquisitions through its history and has essentially operated as a roll-up. However, as opposed to the company's previous string of small acquisitions, Yabuki was willing to pursue larger targets at times and made significant moves to reposition the business. The company sold its nonbanking businesses and acquired electronic bill payment provider CheckFree in 2007. We think the combination of leading positions in core processing and electronic bill payments helped cement Fiserv's market position. After taking a few years off from major acquisitions after CheckFree, Fiserv acquired CashEdge in 2011, which was a bet on growth in peer-to-peer payments. In 2013, the company was opportunistic when troubled core processing peer Open Solutions was put on the block. We think this $1 billion acquisition was a good strategic move and done at an attractive price.The First Data merger was Yabukis last big move. This deal was very similar to the FIS/Worldpay and Global Payments/TSYS combinations that also occurred in 2019. We believe these deals, at least in part, were motivated by a desire to improve online payment offerings, as this area has become too large for traditional acquirers to ignore. These deals all bring together companies with operations on the acquirer and issuer side, which should improve the data available to control fraud, a key issue in serving the online payment space. Additionally, the synergies announced as part of this deal are ample and justify the premium paid, in our view. Finally, First Data had historically struggled with a large debt load which limited its ability to reinvest in the business, an issue that was solved under Fiserv. While FIS is set to undo its merger, we think the combination of Fiserv and First Data has gone well.Bisignano has had to navigate the pandemic since taking over, but we think his tenure has largely been positive so far. We see Clover as the prime example of management's ability to successfully navigate a still evolving industry and maintain Fiserv's scale-based advantage.","Fiserv is a leading provider of core processing and complementary services, such as electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing, for U.S. banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize banks. Through the merger with First Data in 2019, Fiserv also provides payment processing services for merchants. About 10% of the companys revenue is generated internationally.","We dont have any major concerns about Fiservs financial condition. While the First Data merger was stock-based, leverage increased, as Fiserv absorbed First Datas heavier debt load. However, leverage has come down since, and debt/EBITDA was 3.1 times at the end of 2022. This level is not excessive, in our view, considering the stability of the business. But it is still a bit above the companys historical range, which has typically been 2-3 times. Management appears to be focused on debt reduction in the near term. The company enjoys strong and relatively stable free cash flow and doesnt pay a dividend. This creates significant flexibility and should allow the company to pull leverage down to a level in line with the historical average fairly quickly. Once this is accomplished, we would expect share repurchases to be the dominant use of free cash flow, as the company has historically been diligent about returning capital to shareholders, in part due to its desire to maintain its streak of double-digit earnings per share growth.

24/11/2023, Increasing Chevron Fair Value Estimate on Strong Results and Accretive Acquisition,Chevron Corp,CVX,3,27/10/2023,Allen Good,144.33,USD,23/11/2023,172.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,27/10/2023,"Chevron's third-quarter earnings not only fell below market expectations, but management also announced a further delay and cost increase to its two major projects at its TCO asset in Kazakhstan. Both the Wellhead Pressure Management Project and Future Growth Project will start about six months later than previously expected, in first-half 2024 and first-half 2025, respectively, while the projects total costs will be 3%-5% higher than expected. Production in 2024 will be lower than in 2023 because of heavier turnarounds as well. Finally, TCO cash flow will be about $1 billion lower in 2025 than previous guidance, given lower volumes from the project delays. The combined news of weaker-than-expected earnings and delays to Chevrons major projects sent shares lower. However, we think the selloff (about $17 billion in lost market cap) is short-sighted and largely an overreaction. We plan to incorporate the update into our model but do not expect a material change to our $172 fair value estimate or narrow moat rating. Although the projects have been plagued by issues, including having to make special accommodations to continue work through the pandemic, the long-term economics seem intact. As does Chevrons overall competitive position with continued Permian growth and now the addition of Guyana with the Hess acquisition that supports its long-term growth outlook. Including todays selloff, shares are trading about 15%below our fair value estimate. Adjusted earnings fell to $5.7 billion from $10.8 billion a year before due to lower upstream price realizations and weaker global refining margins. Production increased to 3,146 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day from 3,027 mboe/d the year before due largely to the acquisition of PDC Energy and continued growth in the Permian.","Returns and free cash flow generation should improve thanks to a cap on capital spending and the addition of higher margin production volumes.  Chevrons large Permian position is mostly composed of legacy acreage, meaning the firm did not overpay to enter the play; 75% has no or a low royalty rate, giving it a cost advantage. Chevron should realize improved downstream earnings and returns as conditions in its
California refineries improve and new chemical production capacity is added via its CPChem joint venture.
","Chevron is unlikely to ever earn earnings or returns on par with historical averages, given past investments and lower oil prices.  Chevron's focus on the Permian for growth could leave it exposed to cost inflation, given the high levels of activity in the region relative to other basins. Alternatively, it has a high-decline asset that requires high levels of reinvestment. Relatively little investment in new businesses outside hydrocarbons leaves Chevron exposed to potential value destruction and stranded resources if oil demand falls faster than expected. ",31/08/2023,"We expect Chevron to deliver higher returns and margin expansion thanks to an oil-leveraged portfolio as well as the next phase of growth, which is focused on developing its large, advantaged Permian Basin position. Its latest capital plan maintains its focus on capital discipline without sacrificing growth. Thanks to improved cost efficiencies and the acquisition of Noble Energy, Chevron plans to grow production to nearly 4.0 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2027 from about 3.0 mmboe/d in 2023. New volumes will largely come from new production from its differentiated Permian Basin position (size, quality, and lack of royalties), where it expects to grow volumes to 1.25 mmboe/d by 2027 from about 700 mboe/d in 2022 while delivering returns of nearly 30% and about $5 billion of free cash flow by 2027.  Chevron's Permian growth will be supplemented by expansion projects at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, due to begin producing in mid-2023, new developments in the Gulf of Mexico, and potential new discoveries in Mexico and Brazil. Chevron also now has growth options with offshore gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean with the Noble acquisition.  Oil and gas prices will dictate Chevrons earnings and cash flow for the foreseeable future. However, the company is investing in low-carbon businesses to adapt to the energy transition. It recently tripled its investment to $10 billion cumulatively by 2028, with this capital flowing to emerging low-carbon areas that fit with Chevrons existing value chains and experience. Greenhouse gas reduction projects and carbon capture and offset will enable Chevron to achieve its emission targets while investments in hydrogen and renewable fuels will give it a toehold in emerging businesses that could expand in the future.  Chevron expects the combination of new higher-margin projects along with ongoing cost reductions and operational improvements to drive return on capital employed to above 12% by 2027. Meanwhile, strong free cash flow will go toward steady dividend growth and repurchases, demonstrating managements ongoing commitment to capital discipline and shareholder returns.","Chevrons returns on capital have suffered from 2015 to 2020 as a period of high investment was followed by one of low commodity prices. Although it was able to reset its cost structure in the wake of the 2015 collapse in prices, it has not been able to do enough to lift returns back to historical levels when oil prices averaged $100 a barrel. However, we continue to rate Chevron as a narrow-moat company as we think during the next 10 years it will be able to deliver excess returns, albeit well below historical levels, on a combination of an improved cost structure and addition of higher-return production volumes. Chevron is only targeting a return on capital employed of at least 12% by 2027, assuming $60/bbl, much lower than the 16% average from 2010-14 but improved from the 3.5% average from 2015-19. We forecast our return on invested capital metric used to evaluate moats to remain above the cost of capital during the next five years and rise to 12% by 2027, compared with our cost of capital assumption of 7.3%, sufficient for it to earn a narrow moat rating. Although Chevron is an integrated energy company, its narrow economic moat largely rests on the quality of its upstream portfolio. Chevrons upstream segment holds a low-cost position based on an evaluation of its oil- and gas-producing assets. Its greater exposure to liquids and liquids-linked natural gas production, accounting for over 70% of total volumes, has produced peer-leading cash margins and returns of nearly 20% historically. Since 2015, however, returns have suffered in part as oil prices have fallen, but also due to overinvestment at the peak of the last cycle. The best examples are Chevrons LNG projects Gorgon and Wheatstone in Western Australia. Combined the two projects added about 400 mboe/d of production capacity with high margins thanks to contractually set, liquids-based pricing. The projects were already low-return and capital-intensive given the costs associated with timing, location, and complexity, but their returns were depressed further by large cost overruns. As a result, full-cycle returns are likely to be only marginally above the cost of capital, weighing on overall segment and firm returns even as they contribute to higher per-barrel margins. Overall segment returns should improve, however, thanks to higher oil prices during the next five years and the addition of higher-return projects. Newer projects have superior economics and can earn higher returns at lower oil prices after rounds of cost reductions, re-engineering (standardization and simplification), and service price deflation. Outside the Permian, growth during the next five years should largely come from the expansion of its Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, which adds high-margin oil volumes at low break-even prices. Also, its past exploration success in the Gulf of Mexico endows it with a large set of brownfield development opportunities that are economical at less than $45/bbl. Beyond the next five years, Chevron also has opportunities for incremental capacity increases at its Australian LNG projects, which should be high return and a new, large resource basin in the Mediterranean natural gas reserves acquired with Noble for development. Chevrons downstream operations consist of its refining and marketing portfolio, and its interest in the Chevron Phillips Chemical joint venture. Compared with peers, its downstream segment is relatively small with only 1.8 mmboe/d of refining capacity and few owned retail sites. We typically do not consider refining to be a business capable of earning a moat, with the exception of some U.S. refineries that hold a feedstock cost advantage. While Chevron does hold some refineries that qualify on the Gulf Coast and in the midcontinent, the bulk of its capacity does not have such an advantage, given that it is located in California. However, in past years it has improved the performance of its operations, divested lower quality assets and improved returns. Meanwhile, the CPChem joint venture is a high-quality chemical manufacturer with low-cost feedstock access in the U.S. and Middle East. While its earnings contribution is small relative to the upstream segment (30% by our forecast in 2030), it generated strong returns on capital of 18% from 2011 to 2019. We forecast at midcycle levels, returns will approach 18%, supporting Chevons narrow moat rating.Chevron is exposed to several environmental, social, and governance-related risks, but these do not imperil its moat, in our view, as most fall outside the 10-year narrow-moat window or are not probable or material enough risk to cause material value destruction. Chevrons primary ESG risk stems from carbon emissions in its operations and use of its products, emissions, effluents and waste generated in operations such as oil spills and poor community relations. The risk from carbon emissions is most likely to materialize through a carbon tax, which increases the price of end products to consumers, reducing demand over time and threatening Chevrons core business. We expect carbon taxes to gain greater adoption over time, but think the impact on hydrocarbon demand remains more than a decade away. Chevrons upstream greenhouse gas intensity is rather high for its peer group at 29 kilograms CO2e/boe (2021), making it a higher cost producer. However, it is investing efforts to improve its emissions intensity, reduce methane leakage and reduce flaring, but lacks the very long-term targets of some of its peers as well as plans to diversify away from hydrocarbons. It aims to reduce its upstream emissions intensity to 24 kg CO2e/boe by 2028 or about 35% from 2016 levels and be net zero by 2050. That just covers scope 1 and 2 emissions, however; about 90% of emissions from oil and natural gas occur during combustion (scope 3), which the company can do little about.Chevron recently tripled its low-carbon investment to $10 billion cumulatively by 2028 to fund projects in the areas of greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture and offset, hydrogen, and renewable fuels. The amount is less than some peers but is more focused on areas that are tangential to Chevrons core hydrocarbon business or in the value chains it currently participates. Although these areas are still in the early stages and outcomes are uncertain, they hold greater potential for high returns and competitive advantages than more mature areas such as renewable power, where many other integrated oils are investing. Chevron expects these investments to deliver over $1 billion on operating cash flow by 2030, but given their relatively small size and uncertain future, they do not factor into our narrow moat rating. Oil spills are an ever-present risk for oil companies operating offshore and can be devastating to firm value, as BPs Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico shows. While oil companies regularly cause spills, most are immaterial in size and associated fines and cleanup costs are manageable. Large spills such as Macondo are very rare and do not factor into any of our scenario modeling.","Chevron holds a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating based on fundamental exposure to commodity prices, evaluation of ESG risks, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system. Chevron's main risk is the level of oil and natural gas prices which are the primary determinant in cash flow and valuation. Chevron faces the risk global oil demand falls quickly, leaving it unable to fully develop its reserves. Our research suggests oil demand will not decline materially for several more decades, implying more supply will be needed and the risk of stranded assets for Chevron is low. However, greater adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S., specifically California, could reduce demand for refined products, impairing the value of Chevrons refineries. For a company with global operations, geopolitical risk is always an issue. Past events in Nigeria and Venezuela underscore the risk associated with doing business in those countries. By investing in large, capital-intensive projects, such as LNG liquefaction, Chevron also runs the risk that commodity prices will decrease dramatically or it will exceed budgets, making those projects no longer economical. Chevron also holds several ESG-related risks, but based on our framework they are not collectively material enough to alter our scenario analysis-determined uncertainty rating. ESG-related risks include changes in policy related to climate change such as a carbon tax that could result in higher costs, reduced demand, or stranded resources. Operating in offshore environments exposes Chevron to the risk of large oil spills that could result in material losses through lost revenue, fines or penalties, or loss of license to operate. Finally, as a large chemical producer whose products are key components of plastics, Chevron faces the risk environmental concerns result in bans or usage reduction that reduces demand for its products or higher costs related to reuse or recycling.","Based on our capital allocation framework, which evaluates soundness of the balance sheet, investment strategy, and appropriateness of shareholder distributions, Chevron earns an Exemplary rating.Although Chevrons business has a high amount of operating leverage as well as revenue cyclicality, management typically operates with relatively low levels of debt to retain flexibility in times of market weakness. This is evident in its ability to raise debt during the recent downturn, combined with capital expenditure reductions, in order to protect the dividend and still keep net debt to capital under 25%. Given cost reductions, lower spending, and improved market conditions, we expect some deleveraging during the next couple of years. All of this amounts to a sound balance sheet in our framework. Chevron also scores an exceptional rating for its investment strategy. In the past, Chevron has demonstrated a measured approach to acquiring U.S. unconventional assets and stayed out of places such as southern Iraq, where the returns are questionable. We think this indicates Chevron's overall emphasis on returns over growth and is reflected in its returns on capital, which rate near the highest in the sector. Unlike other majors, Chevron has been reluctant to rush into acquisitions or add projects in foreign countries where it cannot add value for the host countries or shareholders. Chevron CEO Michael Wirth seems to be maintaining these policies by not entering a bidding war after making an initial offer for Anadarko and instead turning to a more accretive deal for Noble. Meanwhile the recent deal for PDC Energy was measured and value accretive by our estimates. The company remains focused on capital discipline with a cap on capital spending and the bulk of growth capital going toward the Permian, where it holds a low-cost position, supporting its moat. Furthermore, it can flex investment levels there based on oil prices, which should preserve returns. Unlike many peers, it is avoiding investment in renewable power generation, where it lacks expertise and it is difficult to carve out a competitive advantage. Instead, it is investing in carbon abatement to reduce operating emissions (scope 1 and 2) while investing in renewable fuels where it already participates in value chains. It expects to spend $10 billion by 2028 on these initiatives. We rate Chevrons shareholder distribution policy as appropriate. Although it required debt to pay the dividend in 2020, it had ample capacity to borrow without straining the balance sheet. Furthermore, it has reduced its break-even to below $50/bbl and can easily afford it at our midcycle price at $60/bbl. As such we view its current dividend levels as appropriate and leave room for growth. At $50/bbl oil it expects to generate excess cash, which it will direct toward repurchases. Repurchases afford flexibility and are prudent given the volatility of commodity prices. Historically, Chevron has had a similar policy, but its record on repurchases is mixed as it often repurchased more shares at higher prices. However, all of its repurchases during the last 10 years occurred at prices below our fair value estimate at the time. In order to avoid repeating the mistake of buying the most amount of shares when oil prices and share prices are high, Chevron has reintroduced a repurchase program it believes can be maintained through the cycle and is willing to rely on the balance sheet in times of low prices to do so. As a result, it should be continually buying shares through the cycle, maximizing the potential for value creation.","Chevron is an integrated energy company with exploration, production, and refining operations worldwide. It is the second-largest oil company in the United States with production of 3.0 million of barrels of oil equivalent a day, including 7.7 million cubic feet a day of natural gas and 1.7 million of barrels of liquids a day. Production activities take place in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Its refineries are in the U.S. and Asia for total refining capacity of 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. Proven reserves at year-end 2022 stood at 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, including 6.1 billion barrels of liquids and 30.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.","Chevron carries relatively little debt, with a net debt/capital ratio of 7%, one of the lowest among its peer group. It is targeting a debt/capital ratio of 20%-25% through the cycle and estimates that in a low-price oil scenario of $50/bbl, the ratio will remain within that range. The company makes maintaining and increasing the dividend a priority; as such, we expect steady growth during the next few years as free cash flow rises. Chevron has reduced its break-even level so that free cash flow allows for dividend growth and repurchases at $50/bbl, implying that it has ample cushion if oil prices fall below that level. If need be, Chevron could always take on debt to defend the dividend, given its low leverage levels. At higher oil prices, Chevron can generate excess cash flow that would go toward repurchases. With improved commodity prices, debt has fallen below desired levels while management has steadily increased repurchase guidance. It currently expects to buy back $10 to $20 billion in shares annually assuming oil prices between $50/bbl and $70/bbl. Capital spending is expected to be $17 billion in 2023 while remaining between $16 billion and $18 billion per year thereafter through 2027, including affiliate spending.",CVX,Energy,273365073920.0,NYQ,11858084.0,USD,144.3300018310547,True,1,159.13646976246588,149.331728711542,1
25/11/2023,Splunk Remains Poised for Financial Success With Strong Solutions Across Security and Observability,Splunk Inc,SPLK,3,21/09/2023,Malik Khan,151.93,USD,24/11/2023,144.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,21/09/2023,"On Thursday, Cisco announced its plans to acquire Splunk for $28 billion or $157 per share in cash, a 31% premium to Splunks Sept. 20 closing price. With this acquisition, Cisco is aiming to expand its cybersecurity portfolio by integrating Splunks security information and event management, or SIEM, solution into its broader security solution set. We are raising our fair value estimate to $144 per share, which equates to the value of $157 in cash that will be paid to Splunk shareholders a year from now. For Splunk shareholders, we view the $157 acquisition price as more than fair, representing a 26% upside to our prior stand-alone fair value estimate of $125. This deal appears to be the culmination of ongoing discussions, as reports in February 2022 suggested that Cisco made a $20 billion bid for Splunk. We expect little regulatory scrutiny on this deal given the fragmented nature of the security and observability markets. Cisco and Splunk expect the deal to close within a year. From a strategic perspective, we believe Splunks domestic-leaning business could benefit from Ciscos global presence. Further, as an additional tool in Ciscos broad security toolkit, we also see potential cross-selling opportunities further driving the expansion of Splunks security offerings. We view Splunks solutions as some of the best at ingesting, monitoring, and analyzing machine data. From Ciscos perspective, we think Cisco has access to rich data floating through its infrastructure, so offering a joint security solution that can derive security-related insights/protection from this data is a key add-on. In particular, we think Cisco could leverage Splunks strong SIEM solution and layer it into its own XDR, or extended detection and response, solution. From a go-to-market perspective, we think Ciscos global presence and channel partnerships could potentially enable the firm to sell Splunks security solutions on a larger scale.","Splunk has secular tailwinds behind its back as the security and FSMA markets are expected to grow rapidly. Splunks products are incredibly sticky, offering the company an opportunity to increase cross-selling velocity as customers increase their usage of Splunks platform. Many of Splunks enterprise customers are undergoing digital transformations. This shift should bode well for Splunk as these efforts typically include leveraging technology such as Splunks for efficiency gains.","Due to its cloud transition, there is uncertainty around Splunks execution as a SaaS provider. Splunks recent C-Suite shuffles point to the lack of direction in the executive team, putting the quality of the companys future execution in doubt. Splunks high operating spend and reinvestment in its business put the companys GAAP profitability on the back burner. There is a great deal of uncertainty around when the company will be able to generate positive returns.",21/09/2023,"Splunk is a leader in ingesting, indexing, and analyzing machine generated data, and we believe the company will maintain its leadership status for the foreseeable future. We expect machine data to become more pervasive, impacting every part of an enterprises operations. With more data to ingest, index, and analyze, we believe narrow-moat Splunk has a long runway for growth as it seeks to continue to dominate the enterprise market. Splunks offerings primarily target two broad use cases: security and full-stack monitoring & analysis (FSMA). On the security front, Splunks SIEM, or security information and event management, operates as a well-refined alert system, putting out alerts if any nefarious activity appears on a clients IT ecosystem. Splunks security orchestration, automation, and response, or SOAR, software is geared toward triaging these issues automatically. SIEM and SOAR software, working in tandem, allow an enterprises IT team a reprieve by using artificial intelligence to triage security issues, thereby leading to a substantially lower number of alerts that need to be manually dealt with. The FSMA space is nascent, springing into existence as a method of unifying and coalescing disparate parts of an enterprise's monitoring framework. Splunks FSMA offering seeks to give enterprises a one-stop shop to monitor their entire IT stack, ranging from application performance to logs to end user experience. Splunks offering allows enterprise customers to remove these data silos and monitor the entire IT stack from one consolidated platform.  We believe Splunk warrants a narrow economic moat thanks to high customer switching costs. We view more than 90% of Fortune 100 firms using Splunks offerings as a vote of confidence in its enterprise product lineup. Further, we are impressed by Splunks strong cloud dollar-based net retention (DBNR) that has consistently remained above 120%. With the ability to land large customers and consistently upsell them, we remain confident in Splunks long-term growth prospects. ","We believe Splunk merits a narrow moat rating owing to strong customer switching costs associated with its products. In brief terms, Splunk offers its customers a platform that can ingest, index, and analyze copious amounts of data while offering full-fidelity insights and monitoring. The two primary use cases for such a platform are security and full-stack monitoring. With a comprehensive suite of products that targets enterprise customers in both of these end markets, the value of Splunk's platform can be seen in both its clientele (which includes over 90% of the Fortune 100) and its impressive dollar-based retention metrics. With secular tailwinds behind its back, and a comprehensive suite of inherently sticky product offerings, we believe Splunk is more than likely to generate excess returns over the next 10 years and, therefore, merits an economic moat.We consider Splunk as a competitor in two key industries: security, via its SIEM and SOAR offerings, and full-stack monitoring & analytics (FSMA), via its plays in the observability and IT analytics spaces.SIEM, or security information and event management, companies typically ingest high volumes of machine generated data (typically in the form of log files) and produce real-time analysis of a company's security infrastructure. Think of SIEM as a well-serviced alert system--whenever any irregular activity is detected, the SIEM software will put out an alert, thereby warning the IT team (ideally in real time). Receiving an alert for action is good only if the number of alerts remain at a manageable level. However, with the explosion in machine generated data, primarily due to increased digital connectivity, the number of alerts to a typical IT security team can be overwhelming. Enter security orchestration, automation, and response, or SOAR; SOAR is the glove to SIEMs hand. SOAR software allows an enterprises IT team a reprieve by using artificial intelligence to triage security issues, thereby leading to a substantially lower number of alerts that need to be manually dealt with. To contextualize this, Blackstone, using Splunks SOAR capability, reduced the mean time to resolution, or MTTR, for malware alerts from 30-45 minutes to 40 seconds. As machine generated data continues to increase, we expect the SIEM and SOAR markets to soar. In our view, the SIEM and SOAR spaces are naturally conducive to the presence of economic moats. SIEM and SOAR products can swiftly become essential to business operations and security, thereby making the switch to another vendor painfully difficult. Further, the switch to another vendor may entail data loss or a security lapse, possibilities that further increase switching costs within the SIEM and SOAR space.Switching gears, the full-stack monitoring and analytics, or FSMA, space is nascent, springing into existence as a method of unifying and coalescing disparate parts of an enterprise's monitoring framework. FSMA providers seek to give enterprises a one-stop shop to monitor their entire IT stack, ranging from application performance, to logs, to end user experience. An important criterion within the FSMA space is a provider's ability to ingest large amounts of data, consolidate it, and then make meaningful inferences from it, leading to better business outcomes. The status quo before the emergence of FSMA was various providers focusing on specific parts of the IT stack. For example, an enterprise may have one company monitor its application performance, while another monitored its logs. This, naturally, led to inefficiencies as IT professionals coalesced the outputs manually to construct a meaningful picture of the overall infrastructure's health and performance. FSMA providers are now offering enterprise customers the ability to remove these data silos and monitor the entire IT stack from one consolidated platform. Splunk, as a player in both these spaces, has been able to provide value by using proprietary tools to distinguish itself from its competitors. First, and foremost, is Splunk's ability to index large volumes of data, irrespective of its format. The ability to ingest unstructured data is a major distinguishing factor for Splunk. Through the company's ""schema-on-the-fly"" offering, Splunk offers its customers the ability to input unstructured machine data and derive meaningful insights from it. The increased flexibility has two major impacts on the IT workflow for an enterprise. First, it eliminates the need of standardization of machine generated data to one specific input language, saving IT labor-hours. Second, it allows for a larger set of analyses to be run on the data as unstructured data is not modified or altered to fit a certain form. Splunk's ability to ingest large amounts of data at a fast pace, via forwarders, allows it to store and analyze every single signal on a client's back or front end. This full-fidelity, no-sample approach is another area of differentiation for Splunk among its peers. From elementary statistics, we understand that repeated sampling (if samples are of an adequate size) results in an unbiased estimate of the mean. However, we still recognize that sampling errors exist, pushing the error rate to a non-zero value. The only way to resolve this issue is to effectively monitor every signal aka maintain full fidelity. However, doing so requires an ability to ingest, index, and analyze much more data than repeated sampling--a feat Splunk has been able to accomplish. A good example of how enterprises can utilize Splunks product offering is one of Tesco, a leading global retailer. Splunk is embedded across more than 100,000 Tesco customer touchpoints, ingesting more than 33 terabytes of data daily. Splunk is embedded across the organization from customer support to order fulfilment. Using Splunks dashboard, Tesco is able to observe and monitor critical areas such as IT infrastructure health, the safety of customer transactions, and supply scheduling. Going forward, Splunk is assisting Tesco in the firms digital transformation. We consider Splunks economic moat as a result of strong switching costs, which can be traced to Splunks entrenchment in its clients business and the efficiency gains related to keeping Splunk as the vendor for either security or monitoring needs. We consider Splunk as a leader in the SIEM space and expect that status to translate into continued success in complementary SOAR. Humans and, by extension, enterprises exhibit loss aversion. This, in our opinion, is particularly true in the IT security landscape. When switching SIEM or SOAR vendors, we believe that an enterprise faces operational risks, such as the loss of data during the changeover, project execution, and operational disruption. The more critical the function and the more touch points across an organization a vendor has, the higher the switching costs will be. We believe that any security-related data loss, disruption, or lapse is a material cost associated with switching vendors. We also do not think that enterprises nickel and dime their way to picking a SIEM or SOAR vendor--typically companies will pick the best product out there, provided that it has features most relevant to them. Once this product is deployed, which can take weeks of training and professional help, we rarely see instances of companies moving away from their security vendor. With regard to Splunk, this reality surfaces in multiple data points. The net dollar-based retention, or NDBR, a measure of upselling activity to existing clients netting out churn, is a best-in-class 130%. Further, annual recurring revenue, or ARR, expansion for clients over different time periods also point to clients not only sticking with Splunk but continuing to spend more on the companys products and services.As Splunks SIEM and SOAR enter a clients ecosystem, Splunk is able to capture large swathes of data previously left untapped, due to its superior ingestion and indexing abilities. This data allows Splunk to continually improve its own dashboards, alert systems, and triaging frameworks for that client. As a result, if a client were to leave Splunk for another vendor with a baseline product as good as Splunks, they would have to start from scratch in building out those complex dashboards and alert systems. We view these efficiency gains as tools that further entrench Splunk into the customers ecosystem. This iterative process, once again, solidifies switching costs for companies that, as mentioned above, are picking vendors based on features, not simply price.We view Splunks competitive positioning within the FSMA space as also moatworthy. To understand this competitive positioning, it is important to consider the size and scale of both Splunks customers and its own FSMA offerings. Splunk, as a business, has typically targeted large companies and big public sector organizations. The benefit of this strategy is obvious--while tougher to land than down-market players, larger companies are typically stickier clients. We observe this trend throughout our software coverage, and Splunk is no exception. In the marriage of Splunks FSMA offerings, which range from application performance, log, real user, and interface monitoring, with the size of its clients, we find the perfect mix of deep entrenchment leading to strong switching costs. As a company adopts Splunks observability suite along with its IT analytics offerings, we typically see a movement along the upselling schedule as Splunk is able to grow its impact within the company. As mentioned before, Splunks iterative learning processes learn from the companys machine generated data and are able to optimize monitoring, and drive business efficiencies. This is a multi-step game, with each successful step entrenching Splunks offerings even more as technical users become more accustomed to the monitoring platform that continues to improve. Once again, we point to the retention and ARR expansion metrics listed above as an indicator of the companys strength in executing against its land and expand model.It is worth noting that any cloud transition brings along difficulty in customer retention. For example, Splunk may wish to move one of its existing clients from a term license over to a cloud-based deal. The client, rightfully so, may wish to only move over to Splunks cloud offering once the term license is close to expiry. As a result, there is a sweet spot in which the client can effectively move off Splunks platform onto a competitors without signing the cloud deal. More broadly, the company undergoing a cloud transition effectively opens the exit door but asks the client not to leave. We are impressed with Splunks execution of the cloud transition thus far as the companys churn of clients moving from term to cloud is zero. That is to say that every time Splunk asked the client to stay, the client did. We think this metric demonstrates the stickiness of Splunks products that even when clients have the most obvious time to leave, they do not. Looking ahead, we view Splunks new workload pricing model as the right step in the companys land and expand strategy. In the past, Splunk would charge customers based on the amount of data ingested, or the data they were presenting for Splunks analysis/monitoring. With workload pricing, customers are paying for the actual analysis/monitoring, irrespective of the initial ingestion size. The difference between paying for either the input or the process is substantial. If there is no price to get data into Splunk, enterprises will import more data into Splunk. Once Splunk is able to access this data, the increased volume allows Splunks AI engine to continually improve itself, thereby improving the output whether it be in the security or FSMA spaces. With the improved output, and pricing, which is not as rigid as the amount of space allocated for ingestion, we see enterprises store and spend materially more on Splunks products after switching to the workload pricing model. We see this pricing model as creating more sticky products as Splunk is able to generate better insights into a firms operations, a direct result of the increased data input.","We assign Splunk a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High due to its ongoing cloud transition, place in a high-growth market, and execution risk. First, Splunk is currently undergoing a cloud transitionwith the company moving clients on term licenses over to its cloud-based software as a service. While the retention rate of clients moving from term licenses to cloud has been 100% thus far, there is an inherent risk involved during the transition. Effectively, the company opens the exit door for its clients, but asks them not to leave. Second, while Splunk is a leader in the security and full-stack monitoring segments, there is competition on both fronts. Currently, the market dynamics favor Splunk with the firms offerings geared toward an enterprise market while its competitors focus on down-market clients. However, there is reason to believe that competitors that boast strong products, such as Datadog, will invest more in building enterprise-scale products leading to competition for Splunk in its home field. Last, while we firmly believe in the long-term opportunity Splunk has, wed be remiss not to highlight the risks associated with execution. Splunk operates in a sector that promises rewards to winners after a substantial period of investment and operating losses. Splunk is yet to post a GAAP profit following its shift to cloud. We are not modeling GAAP profitability until fiscal 2025. To bask in the light in the long term, Splunk will have to execute well for years to come. With major C-Suite departures over the last year, there are some who see the shuffles at the top as reasons to doubt Splunks ability to execute. We do not see any material environmental, social, and governance issues for Splunk. While Splunk handles mission-critical data, the data itself is typically housed in the clients cloud/data center. A breach could potentially raise legal issues, but we do not see Splunk as particularly exposed to data privacy risks.","We assign Splunk a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think Splunks balance sheet is healthy. While long-term debt currently exceeds the firms cash on its balance sheet, we do not see the firm facing any material risk of funding any upcoming debt maturities. Further, we think the stickiness of the firms products make them less cyclical as clients do not reduce their spend on Splunk dramatically during economic downturns. This downside protection will enable the firm to maintain healthy cash flow generation in the future, thereby strengthening its balance sheet.Splunks investment strategy has been simple, and appropriate. The firm has been smart about their investments which can be split up in two parts. First, Splunk has invested a great deal into its own products and building a strong client base. This organic investment is seen in the firms technological advances in logs and its enterprise clients that it has been able to land. Second, Splunk has also been adroit in its acquisition strategy with investing in companies that have allowed it to expand its portfolio to both metrics and traces. We see these investments as crucial as the company plays into the observability space, with metrics and traces, along with logs, being the fundamental building blocks of observability. We expect Splunk to continue with small acquisitions along with its organic investments as it builds out a comprehensive monitoring and security platform.Splunk does not have a dividend and typically does not engage in share buybacks. We see this strategy as appropriate as the company is investing heavily in its growth engine that should generate positive returns over our explicit forecast. ","Splunk is a cloud-first software company that focuses on analyzing machine data. The company is a major player in two markets: security and full-stack monitoring & analysis. The San Francisco-based firm focuses on enterprise clients, with more than 90% of the Fortune 100 using its solutions. The firms top line consists of the sale of software licenses, cloud subscriptions, and maintenance and support.","We believe Splunks financial position is healthy. Splunk ended fiscal 2023 with around $2.0 billion in cash and current investments. This is juxtaposed with the companys convertible senior notes of $3.10 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. While debt exceeds cash-in-hand currently, we believe Splunks cash and cash generation over the next five years will far outstrip its commitments over the same time period. As the company undergoes the cloud transition, its effect on free cash flow has been evident. The companys FCFE (free cash flow to equity) margins from 2014 to 2019 were comfortably in the double-digits. However, with the cloud transition dampening revenue and increasing operating spend, free cash flow margins have been significantly lower than before. However, we expect these transitory costs to allay and project that Splunk will achieve consistent double-digit FCFE margins starting fiscal 2024. We do not expect any major shifts in Splunks capital structure. We foresee the company raising capital in the future by issuing more equity or taking advantage of low interest rates and issuing debt.",SPLK,Technology,25506824192.0,NMS,1731278.0,USD,151.92999267578125,True,0,130.6644699096647,153.52243550618078,0
24/11/2023,ITT Will Drive Continued Margin Expansion on Productivity and Aerospace Volume Leverage,ITT Inc,ITT,3,22/11/2023,Joshua Aguilar,108.8,USD,23/11/2023,113.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,22/11/2023,"We will discontinue analyst coverage of ITT on or about Dec. 21. We provide analyst research and ratings on over 1,500 companies globally and periodically adjust our coverage according to investor interest and staffing.","Solutions like copper-free and smart brake pads will help ITT win content on additional and existing platforms, and its material science expertise should help with wins in the electrical vehicle original equipment segment. CEO Luca Savi will bring the same focus and drive operational efficiency to both IP and CCT as he did in MT; long-term, both IP and CCT can deliver 20% segment operating margins. An unleveraged balance sheet gives the company room to make value-accretive acquisitions.","Regenerative braking found in electric vehicles could kill ITTs brake pad replacement business. ITTs pump business is overly cyclical and price-competitive, and business profits could fail to compensate for inherent project complexity. ITT lacks scale in its connectors business, and its larger competitors can sell commodity products at a much lower unit cost.",03/11/2023,"We think ITT is well-positioned to continue winning in its marque brake pad business (owning nearly 30% global market share), while a focus on continuous improvement will drive both its industrial process and connect and control technologies' segments to over 20% adjusted segment operating margins.  In our view, the market is overly focused in the near term on raw material inflation and the semiconductor shortage. We think the semiconductor shortage should begin to ameliorate in 2023. More importantly, ITT regularly outperforms light vehicle production by greater than 800 basis points. While we expect about half of that outperformance looking forward in a low-growth light vehicle market, we still believe this is a good business that produces strong returns on capital (mid-30s). We think ITT will continue to win based on a combination of material science expertise, technological innovations like the smart pad, and its consistent record of on-time delivery (greater than 99%). Furthermore, we expect that CEO Savi and CFO Caprais will implement the same successful playbook they used in motion technologies, or MT, in ITT's other businesses. Successful tactics from this playbook include lean tools and automation to drive shop floor productivity gains, improved supply chain low-cost sourcing, and better price management. While MT is extensively automated, that's not necessarily the case for all ITT's facilities, such as with Seneca Falls.  Furthermore, recent acquisitions offer attractive synergy opportunities. For instance, Habonim's simplified and standardized design process is a core competency, and we think ITT can implement best practices to save on both manufacturing and engineering expenses.  Finally, we think investors underappreciate the windfall from the commercial aerospace recovery as passenger desire to travel remains strong. Therefore, we think connect and control technologies will be ITT's strongest growth segment. ","We assign ITT a narrow economic moat rating, although we believe the overall consolidated business is on the slimmer side of narrow. We base our rating primarily on switching costs and intangible assets, mostly anchored on ITTs best and consistently growing businesses: motion technologies and, to a lesser extent, connect and control technologies.We see switching costs related to ITTs mission-critical, highly engineered products found in defensible niches in infrastructure; the high cost of failure in the end markets it serves; its ability to lower a customers total cost of ownership; the need for customers to comply with increasing environmental and safety regulations; and multiyear contracts, which can include provisions that require the use of ITTs products. We also identify intangible assets based on well-regarded brands associated with quality and reliability; valuable customer relationships, including with original-equipment and Tier 1 manufacturers; and intellectual property, including patents and know-how.We award the MT segment a narrow moat rating. Switching costs arise from a customers time and effort to find a comparable supplier that can deliver both safety and reliability, the need to maintain proper certifications, and the possible disruption to a customers production process. By our estimates, when including an apportionment of ITTs corporate costs, which include shared services, and goodwill, ROICs have averaged in the mid- to high teens for the segment in recent years. On a normalized basis, we believe this segment can earn ROICs well into the 20s, which we find impressive given the cyclical nature of its end markets. Depending on how the market is defined, the company reports market share in the mid-20s. Nearly 85% of the business serves the automotive industry, with rail making up nearly the entire remaining portion. At 70% or so of segment revenue, the largest subsegment in MT is friction technologies, which manufactures a variety of original-equipment brake pads on passenger cars and light- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles as well as aftermarket brake pads designed for the automotive service and repairs market. Brake pads are highly engineered products. They must be specifically designed and fitted for each vehicle with reliable quality. Therefore, customer intimacy is vital. Brake pads will often vary slightly in chemical composition depending on the make and model of a vehicle. There are also several specifications that manufacturers look for in brake pads, including limits on dust, noise, and vibration levels, as well as performance expectations. Formulations for North American brake pads have evolved, which we believe reinforces MTs switching cost moat source. For example, brake pads use molybdenum as a lubricant to reduce wear and tear as well as noise from breaking. Molybdenum is commonly used in steel alloys for its ability to form hard, stable carbides. It is advantageous in brake pads because it has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals, which further reduces vibration. The cost of this raw material has been historically volatile, however. This is problematic because many brake pad designs rely on this raw material. ITT was able to replace this material with a proprietary mix of compounds while still managing to lower a customers total cost of ownership.We believe ITTs continued development of advanced materials also evidences some intangible assets. These formulations can employ upward of 14 different organic and synthetic compounds. MT uses a dry formulation approach when it makes its brake pads, which is a powder-based manufacturing process of the brake pad that it codesigned with its suppliers. ITT has an agreement with its suppliers to lock up that technology for five years, which prevents imitation from its competitors. While this five-year technological advantage is shorter than our narrow moat rating time frame, it excludes ITTs decade-plus aftermarket advantage. At 3.4% of sales, ITTs proportional spending on research and development exceeds the median allocation in our diversified industrial coverage (typically 2%-3% of sales). Yet, at a consolidated level, ITT earns over $9.40 on five-year returns on research capital (current year gross profit over prior R&D spending over a five-year period), appreciably greater than the average of other innovative industrial firms we cover. Regulation is also changing the formulation of brake pads, driven primarily by environmental and safety concerns. A key element of ITTs strategy that we believe was successful was its mass proliferation of copper-free brake pads, which were developed in 2012. Traditional brake pads are made with copper lining. Copper has a melting point above 1,000 degrees centigrade. It also has high ductility, meaning it can be made into a wire, given its ability to stretch under high-tensile stress. Copper forms a film on brake pads that increases thermal conductivity and heat resistance. However, this increased braking efficacy comes with a side effect: copper thats discharged as friction powder when braking can contaminate the water supply. Some studies have pointed out that brake pads are the single-largest source of copper discharge to the San Francisco Bay, for instance. Excess levels of copper are toxic to wildlife. This phenomenon has prompted numerous jurisdictions, including Washington state and California, to not only ban sales of brake pads containing over 0.5% of copper by weight but also legally oblige auto repair shops to phase out their stock by no later than 2025. The U.S. Environment Protection Agency also signed an initiative with states to reduce the use of copper in brake pads. Brake pads that meet the new low-copper requirements are being certified by the Automotive Manufacturers Equipment Compliance Agency. Ratings include A, B, and N edge codes. Europe also favors MTs copper-free innovation, as evidenced by MTs win rates. We believe this preference should continue positively affecting share in MTs front axle installed base, which in turn should help protect MTs higher-margin aftermarket revenue despite market headwinds. Front axles wear more rapidly than rear axles. Brake pads must also meet strict safety compliance standards. In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration promulgates national highway safety standards, but each state also has a transportation agency to enforce its own safety standards. These agencies implement regulation based on braking performance, including requirements for maximum stopping distance for passenger vehicles traveling at a certain speed, which indirectly affects brake pads when they are installed as original equipment. Multiyear contracts also evidence switching costs. Automotive platforms that MT secures can last from 2 to 30 years. MT is the largest supplier of brake pads to Ford and holds other vital customer relationships with North American OEMs like General Motors and Chrysler, as well as European OEMs like BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault, Jaguar, Porsche, and Daimler. MT also supplies back plate brake pads to Tesla. While ITT does have some customer concentration (23% of MTs revenue comes from Continental), certain contractual provisions protect MTs competitive position. ITTs annual report points out that about 50% of total MT revenue derived from Continental must use an ITT brake pad, generally based on supply agreements directly with OEMs. The remaining 20%-30% of MT mostly sells rail damping and absorption solutions as well as coupling components through its KONI and Axtone brands. We believe ITT is well positioned in the rail business, given its strong presence in the European market, where we anticipate most of the industrys growth will come from. Switching costs are evident in this industry, given many of same dynamics, including concerns about passenger safety, security, and reliability as well as demand for energy-efficient transport systems. Passenger preferences are increasingly moving toward advanced trains for superior speed (less travel time) and comfort. When operated as intended, advanced trains also consume one fifth the energy per passenger kilometer compared with automobile travel. Advanced rail must still comply with noise and vibration limitations, and ITT makes damping and absorption solutions that meet customers' precise specifications. We expect the transition toward high-speed rail in China will further be a boon to the numerator in MTs segment-level ROICs, where ITT consistently reports taking significant share.We think the industrial process segment has no moat. To varying degrees, many of the dynamics that are prevalent in ITTs two other segments are also at play in IP, including long lead times, highly engineered equipment, a sizable installed base, customer intimacy, numerous industry environmental and safety standards, and solutions that reduce a customers total cost of ownership. Even so, when baking in goodwill and corporate costs into IPs ROICs, we think this business typically runs at its cost of capital throughout the cycle, though we expect this will improve.We see several reasons for this dynamic. First, we think a large portion of the business serves engineering and construction firms as well as large multinational firms. E&C firms are inherently highly cyclical, are intensely competitive, lack significant customer bargaining power, and service relatively standardized projects as underpinned by our no-moat ratings on these firms. Aside from the inevitable commoditization to portions of IPs product portfolio stemming from its E&C customers standardized projects, we believe these dynamics hit ITT in other ways. Specifically, customers that have their own competitive pressures will go through periods where their own order pace ebbs and flows. We suspect multinational customers also have a greater deal of bargaining power with IP, given the competitive nature of the industry. Second, only about 20%-25% of IPs business is project-based with long lead times. These longer-term projects are where IPs highly engineered pumps, which are inherently more complex, are sold. Even so, this business is a minority portion of the segments sales mix. Valves, by contrast, generally have shorter lead times.Third, we believe IP lacks the large installed base of some of its other competitors, which leads to a smaller proportion of higher-margin aftermarket sales. Finally, we believe some of IPs problems are self-inflicted, stemming from poor execution. We believe IP has underpriced some past projects to maintain share, which simply failed to compensate IP for its inherent participation risks. Aside from the apparent bargaining power of customers, from a Porters Five Forces perspective, we believe IP suffers from inherently weak bargaining power with its own suppliers, given that suppliers havent historically been held financially accountable for delivery delays. We assign connect and control technologies a modest narrow moat rating. CCT makes highly engineered connectors and specialized control products in mission-critical industries, like aerospace and defense, as well as harsh and hazardous environments, as commonly seen in the oil and gas industry. CCTs connectors are manufactured to tight tolerances. This segment focuses on the harsh environment connector niche, which is lower volume but higher margin and more complex (not commoditized). Relationships with independent distributors, which further provide high levels of service in the aftermarket, can last for decades. In some end markets, OEMs and suppliers like CCT will collaborate closely in the development of products. Switching to an alternative would require a customer to potentially retrain and retool its manufacturing. The customer cost of switching to marginally cheaper products that meet a similar reliability standard is meaningful in terms of time, expense, and loss of revenue. CCTs products are therefore often part of long-lived platforms that allow for contractually recurring aftermarket revenue, which typically ranges from 5 to 20 years. According to company transcripts, most of CCTs aerospace and defense exposure, which represents nearly 50% of segment revenues, is commercial aerospace. Commercial aerospace has contracts that typically exceed the high end of the range. CCTs content is on important commercial aerospace platforms, including the Boeing 777X and the 737 MAX, as well as their predecessors. While its products are predominantly found on Boeing airframes, CCT also has some Airbus content. CCTs products, which include actuators and switches as well as noise-canceling components, are integrated into the design of an airframe. Connectors, which are used in avionics, cabin systems, navigation and control equipment, and commercial aerospace engines, must endure extreme temperatures and resist extreme levels of vibration with significant high costs of failure. For example, in the harshest shock environments, even the most reliable ratcheting coupling systems can decouple. While coupling systems are a small part of an airframes bill of materials, loss of power and control from coupling failure in critical applications could be catastrophic, both in terms of lives lost and protracted downtime. We believe these dynamics indicate switching costs.CCT revenue tends to be consistent, with management reporting a steady mid-single-digit CAGR in the 30-year period preceding 2013. We believe CCTs strong brands like ITT Cannon, which are strongly associated with safety and reliability, as well as its strong customer relationships contribute to this dynamic and demonstrate some modest intangible assets. CCT also has positive optionality, given the trend toward electrification. The segment can continue to expand into other mission-critical industries while leveraging its current technology, including medical (patient monitoring and diagnostic equipment), electric vehicles (charging stations), and rotorcraft. While segment ROICs, when including both goodwill and corporate costs have narrowly beat our estimated WACC, we note that estimated ROICs exceeded 14% in 2021. We think they can continue to exceed our WACC hurdle by a safe margin through midcycle.","We assign ITT a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Like other multi-industrials, ITT is exposed to broader macroeconomic risk and a corresponding slowdown in its end markets, fallout related to tariffs from a trade war, cybersecurity risks as it adds solutions like its smart pad, and failure to develop new products that gain acceptance from the market. ITT has some idiosyncratic risks germane to the company. Some of its end markets experience a higher degree of cyclicality relative to other industrial (specifically oil and gas, mining, and chemicals). Its 60% revenue mix outside North America (based on 2020 revenue), in our view, gives it slightly higher tax and labor relations risk.The biggest risk to our long-term ITT thesis stems from EV and hybrid disruption. We dont expect this trend will cause material disruption to ITTs OEM channel, which represents about two thirds of its brake pad business. EV and hybrid disruption, however, poses a threat to the MT aftermarket. Morningstar predicts above-consensus global EV adoption rates. Even so, we calculate that EV adoption would only eviscerate about 1% of ITTs sales mix by 2028 (just under $50 million), given ITTs current sizable installed base (market share currently sits in the mid-20s according to management).As for ESG risks, we're not particularly concerned. On June 30, 2021, ITT eliminated its largest ESG risk, in our view, when it divested all of its legacy asbestos liabilities through a transaction that saw ITT contribute $398 million in cash to a portfolio subsidiary owned by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, in exchange for an indemnification agreement. We think the company made the right decision to ringfence this liability, which we considered material and that we model in our 2021 base case. Other liabilities, however, are either not material or have a low likelihood of occurring, including ITT's other environmental liabilities and its human capital risks in a tight skilled labor market.","We assign ITTs management team a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. From our perspective, ITT's balance sheet rating is sound, its investments are fair, and its shareholder distributions are appropriate. The company is in a positive net cash position and management has made positive investment decisions and strong execution that we think will likely translate to increasing economic profits for shareholders. While the company returns capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, we think repurchases have a mixed record depending on the historical time period.ITTs portfolio has witnessed several iterations as prior management teams sought to reinvent the firm. After the spinoffs of Xylem and Exelis in 2011, we think the current conglomerate is leaner and more focused. We also have a very positive view of CEO Luca Savi, who took the helm in January 2019 after Denise Ramos retired. We think he is the right person for the job, particularly given his record as president of motion technologies. After stints at Fiat, Honeywell, and Royal Dutch during the earlier parts of his career, Savi joined ITTs MT segment in 2011. We believe Savis contributions were a large part of why ITTs market capitalization multiplied several times after the post-2011 spinoffs. Indeed, ITTs brake pad business was Ramos top priority and overtook IP as the largest segment during her tenure. While friction technologies (housed with the MT segment) was already the brake pad market leader in Europe, Savi helped ITT drive above-market growth with significant share gains in both the North American and Chinese markets (the latter of which went from 0% share to mid-20s share, according to management). ITTs historical guidance struggled to encapsulate the friction technologies share gains under Savis leadership. Savis teams top-line growth performance never came at the expense of margins, which grew over 400 basis points from 2012 to 2016 (Savi later oversaw IP in 2017 when he was named COO as heir-apparent to Ramos). We think this reflected the teams ability to optimize highly efficient and automation production processes over a concentrated footprint. We expect Savi will continue to drive operational improvements in ITTs other two segments, and we expect that this, coupled with organic growth, will remain ITTs focus during his tenure as CEO. We think CCT and IP can eventually reach operating margins between 21% and 22%.From a capital allocation standpoint, ITT announced a $1-billion share repurchase authorization back in October. We hope it buys back more shares because we think the stock is discounted relative to our revised fair value estimate (share price of $100 compared with a $113 fair value estimate following third-quarter earnings). The firm pays a dividend at a forward yield of over 1% from the current stock price. From 2012 to 2022, ITT returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks while spending over $900 million on acquisitions (net of cash acquired), including the acquisitions of Habonim, Rheinhuette Pumpen Group, and Matrix Composites. RPG fits well with the rest of IPs portfolio, gives ITT a stronger European pump foothold, has a well-regarded brand with historical pedigree, and was bought at a lower enterprise value/sales ratio than core ITT, and it appears to work well with Gould Pumps given cross-selling opportunities. Habonim should give ITT an edge in its design process, which is a core competency of Habonim. ITT is also acquiring a cryogenic marine pump supplier for approximately $400 million in 2024, which strikes us as a good deal because 1) it fit well into IP and 2) it implies EBITDA accretion.Emmanuel Caprais was appointed CFO effective Oct. 1, 2020, and will replace Tom Scalera. We like the choice of Caprais given his deep operational knowledge, candor, and exceptional familiarity with ITT's financials and we think he's a great partner for CEO Savi.","ITT is a diversified industrial conglomerate with over $3 billion in sales.

24/11/2023,"Low Debt, Ample Liquidity, and Pent Up New Vehicle Demand Are All Favorable for Penske",Penske Automotive Group Inc,PAG,2,17/11/2023,David Whiston,152.2,USD,23/11/2023,130.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,17/11/2023,"At the Los Angeles auto show on Nov. 16, Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon in which, starting next year, some of its dealers will sell new vehicles on Amazon.com. The news sent each of the six franchise dealers and CarMax down about 5%-8%, which we think is a large overreaction predicated on fears of Amazon taking share away from dealers. Such a risk is not even possible on new vehicle sales due to state franchise laws, nor do we think it is likely that Amazon wants to do all aspects of auto retailing such as handling and disposing of trade-ins, service, and finance and insurance offerings. Service is a very underappreciated benefit that dealers provide customers when comparing the traditional auto industry to digital retailing and electric vehicle startups' direct sales formats. Should Amazon directly sell used vehicles someday, CarMax would have more competition, but it also has the ability to sell via brick-and-mortar, digital-only, or any combination of both depending on what the customer wants, something a digital-only retailer cannot offer. Our auto coverage has been implementing omnichannel tools for years and we doubt that any of their management teams are surprised by the Amazon news. Details, especially around economics, are thin, but Automotive News cited a Hyundai spokesperson who said starting in January, only 18 Hyundai dealers will partner with Amazon, with that number expanding in the second half of the year. Prominent LA auto dealer Mike Sullivan joined Hyundai and Amazon in the presentation to say the dealer will still be the seller of record and reiterated other customer benefits that dealers provide like services. Its possible this arrangement is a larger version of Costcos auto program that provides members the ability to buy a new or used vehicle from over 3,000 dealers of various brands.","Auto dealerships are stable, profitable businesses with a diversified stream of earnings coming from parts, service, and used cars. Parts and service revenue should continue to be lucrative over time because most manufacturers require warranty work to be done at the dealership, and large dealers can more easily afford the technology and training needed to service increasingly more complex vehicles. Penske is well suited to acquire dealerships because many small dealers do not want to keep paying expensive facility upgrades mandated by the automakers.","As publicly traded dealers command greater share in some markets, manufacturers may refuse to approve transfers of franchise rights at some dealerships, limiting acquisition-based growth. The timing and extent of recovery from the chip shortage is unknown. Higher rent and a less lucrative mix of profitable financing commissions can cause Penske to incur more SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit than peers. However, when rent expense is excluded, the company's ratio is typically more in line with the average for public dealerships.",27/07/2023,"Penske Automotive Group receives over 90% of its light-vehicle dealer revenue from import and luxury brands. This percentage is significantly higher than many dealers and helps mitigate the cyclical nature of auto sales; these brands have more-affluent customers who will not limit their discretionary spending during a downturn. Despite this wealthy customer, the firm's operating margin tends to be on the lower end of the publicly traded dealers. Penske gets less of its gross profit from higher-margin finance and insurance commissions than its peers, and selling, general, and administrative expenses (including rent expense) as a percentage of gross profit are higher than the other public dealers. Penske cannot get as much finance business--a 100% gross margin business--as its peers because more of its customers lease vehicles or pay cash. When excluding rent, Penske's SG&A ratio is competitive. Penske has heavy-truck distribution in Australia and New Zealand, 44 truck dealers in the U.S. and Canada, and 20 CarShop used-vehicle stores in the U.S. and U.K. The National Automobile Dealers Association reports that as of 2022, the number of U.S. new-car dealerships was 16,773, down from 25,025 in 1987. This highly fragmented industry is always consolidating because smaller players cannot compete with the scale of the public franchise dealers, and it's very difficult for a small operator to be awarded an open point by an automaker for a new store. Parts and service was only 10% of 2022 retail automotive revenue but made up 35% of gross profit. This significant contribution to profitability is less volatile than new- and used-vehicle sales and will continue to mitigate the cyclical risk of the auto industry. Large dealers are enjoying a growing competitive advantage for repair work because the increasingly advanced technology of cars presents an obstacle for smaller repair shops that are less able to afford the equipment and training needed to provide competent service. Consumers incur search costs (most notably time) to get many service estimates, which we think makes it more likely that they will keep going to the dealer.","We are maintaining our narrow moat rating, as Penske's size continues to generate economies of scale and working capital efficiencies while the service segment's warranty work gives the company an intangible advantage over garages. A large dealer such as Penske can move inventory around to different stores where it will be in most demand, something a small dealer with just one or two stores in that same market cannot do. We think the dealer sector is the best business in the automotive supply chain. The public dealers can centralize back-office operations and generate far more volume than a small dealer, which brings scale. Dealers have no burdensome retiree expenses, and the large public dealers are not dependent on the health of one brand. The dealers enjoy mid- to high-single-digit gross margins on new vehicles and 100% gross margins on financing and insurance. We think the best source of competitive advantage is the parts and service operations. Many customers bring their vehicle to the dealer for servicing because either the vehicle is under warranty or the dealer is close to home and has the factory parts and expertise to service the vehicle. Once vehicle owners know a dealer, we think they are likely to keep going back to the dealer for service. The dealer knows the vehicle, and comparison-shopping for repair work is very time-consuming since the customer has to bring the vehicle to each shop to get a quote. These cost advantages and intangible advantages from service give dealers a moat.These logistics create inelasticity of demand, which creates pricing power for the dealer and is a source of excellent profit in good times and bad. In fact, during a downturn in new-vehicle sales, dealers generally report higher gross margins due to a favorable mix shift to parts, but then report lower operating margins due to SG&A deleveraging. Excluding large impairment and restructuring charges, dealers can still report positive EBIT even in a severe recession. Although most dealerships are good businesses, we think the large publicly traded dealers are best positioned for growth since they can be the most flexible in changing brand mix. Many small-business owners are choosing to exit or sell because they cannot get the scale on a variety of expenses compared with large dealer groups.","Our fair value Uncertainty Rating for Penske is High. Like all companies that make many acquisitions, Penske always faces the risk of overpaying for a dealership. As a result, it may be forced into taking a loss (to dispose of it) or fair value impairment charge in a subsequent period. Penske also could have operational problems integrating a new dealership, which could slow the store from reaching an acceptable profitability level. Auto sales are cyclical, but the company mitigates this risk by selling highly profitable repair and warranty services. The company is also expanding its stand-alone used-vehicle stores in the U.S. and U.K., which brings execution risk and the risk of wasted capital, though we think the venture will prove worthwhile. The cadence of recovery from the chip shortage and inflation's impact on consumer buying power brings uncertainty. We see governance as the biggest focus area for ESG investors. Roger Penske, 86, has been chairman and CEO since 1999. He is also chairman and CEO of Penske Corp., which owns about 50% of Penske Automotive Group. The company has a solid bench of potential successors, including Rogers sons Greg and Roger Jr., both around age 60, who each have served on the boards of both Penske Automotive Group and Penske Truck Leasing plus have experience running dealerships. Greg is currently vice chairman of the board. Roger Jr. used to be an executive at Penske Automotive as well, including president. Beyond Roger Sr.'s sons, the company's operations are run at the field level and management believes that many store managers function as CEOs already. We think the company is doing all it can to mitigate key-man risk around Roger Sr.'s age, and we continue to believe he is the best person to be CEO. The next-largest shareholder is Tokyo-based Mitsui, with a stake of about 19%. Under certain circumstances, Penske Corp. can vote Mitsui's shares, which would effectively give it about 70% of total voting power.","We award Penske Automotive Group a Standard capital allocation rating focused around balance sheet health, investments, and shareholder distributions. Management made what we saw as positive moves for the companys financial health in 2020, despite the pandemic, by reducing long-term debt by $670 million. This reduction came mostly from redeeming two $300 million bonds. The first retirement was 3.75% notes due in August 2020, but management also called 5.375% 2024 notes at 101.792%. A third redemption occurred in October 2020 when management used the $550 million of 3.50% 2025 senior notes issued in August 2020 to redeem all $550 million of 5.75% 2022 senior notes. June 2021 saw another redemption with the company issuing $500 million 3.75% 2029 notes to redeem the $500 million 5.50% 2026 notes. We like management taking advantage of the available liquidity and the ultra low rate environment to deleverage and lower interest expense. We think these moves give the firm more flexibility to make acquisitions in both light vehicle and Class 8 truck dealerships, open more CarShop stores, and if need be issue more debt to help fund its growth plans. Pretax income, including equity method income, was a record $1.6 billion in 2021 and another record $1.9 billion in 2022, but we don't see 2021-22 earnings as normal years due to excellent pricing power from the chip shortage on low inventory. The largest debt maturities through 2025 are $75.2 million in 2023 and $679.2 million in 2025.The truck business annual revenue capability is roughly $4 billion, and we expect more deals with likely exclusive focus on the Freightliner brand given management's long-time relationship with Daimler Trucks. On the light vehicle side, we would not be surprised if more light vehicle acquisitions are announced in 2023 given the ever-consolidating nature of the sector. In June 2021, the company entered North Carolina with the purchase of a Mercedes store. In February 2021, management announced expansion plans for the standalone used vehicle stores. These stores in the U.S. and U.K. will take on the CarShop brand and the 20 used vehicle stores were targeted to soon be at 40 generating $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion in revenue, but those plans appear to be on hold due to the low supply of late model used vehicles following poor off-lease volume caused by the pandemic and chip shortage. Recent used vehicle affordability problems for both consumers and retailers due to the chip shortage may mean this goal won't be reached. Still, we like management moving more aggressively with these stores as the used vehicle market is highly fragmented and we see no reason Penske cannot remain a leading retailer in the space.We would like to see the company's return on invested capital meaningfully exceed its cost of capital like it has in 2021 and 2022. We like that the company resumed its dividend in fourth-quarter 2020 after suspending it for just two quarters due to COVID-19. The firm raised the dividend for 35 consecutive quarters before COVID-19 forced its suspension. Four of the six public dealers pay a dividend, and Penskes dividend yield is one of the best in the space. Management targets a payout ratio of 30%-35%. For 2019-22, the ratio was 30%, 13%, 12%, and 11% by our calculation, using adjusted diluted earnings per share which in 2021 and 2022 were far higher than historical levels. We see more payout increases likely given CEO Roger Penskes control of the company. In September 2019, the board increased the buyback authorization to $200 million, again in July 2021 to $250 million, by $250 million in December 2021, by $250 million in July 2022, and $250 million in February. As of June, $246.3 million remains available. The program allows management to repurchase either stock or debt. We see buybacks possible at the same time as dividend raises, but we think acquisition growth will be a priority over buybacks except when asking prices are too high. In our view, management's standards on what makes a fair price seem to have a high threshold, and Penske did not make a megasized acquisition of a few billion dollars of acquired annual revenue as many public dealers did in 2021. Management has lately been more aggressive on buybacks, and the diluted share count at the end of 2022 was 14.2% lower than at year-end 2019. We like that the dealers can do both buybacks and acquisitions.","Penske Automotive Group operates in about 20 U.S. states and overseas. It has about 150 U.S. light-vehicle stores including in Puerto Rico as well as 189 franchised dealerships overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom. The company is the second-largest U.S.-based dealership in terms of light-vehicle revenue and sells more than 35 brands, with over 90% of retail automotive revenue coming from luxury and import names. Other services, in addition to new and used vehicles, are parts and repair and finance and insurance. The firm's Premier Truck Group owns 44 truck dealerships selling mostly Freightliner and Western Star brands, and Penske owns 20 CarShop used-vehicle stores in the U.S. and U.K. The company is based in Michigan and was called United Auto Group before changing its name in 2007.","EBIT covered interest expense was 20.4 times in 2022, up from about 3 times during the Great Recession. At year-end 2022, Penske has one large debt maturity over the next few years, which is $550 million of 3.5% notes due in September 2025. The company issued $500 million of 3.75% 2029 senior subordinated notes in second-quarter 2021 to fully redeem the $500 million 5.50% 2026 notes. Total credit line availability at year-end was about $1 billion and a mortgage line has an additional $92 million available. Debt/EBITDA at the end of 2022 was 0.8 times from 4.7 at year-end 2008 due to debt reductions and turbocharged earnings. Management has reduced debt by over $600 million since the end of 2019.Penske's non-floor-plan debt financing mostly comes from bank lines in the U.S. and U.K. The U.S. facility at year-end 2022 was $800 million of revolving loans for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other purposes. The facility matures Sept. 30, 2025, and had no balance outstanding at the end of 2022. The U.K. facility is GBP 200 million revolver expiring in January 2027. It also has a GBP 100 million accordion clause to request more capacity if required. As of year end, borrowings on the U.K. facility were GBP 20 million. At Dec. 31, availability was $800 million on the U.S. facility, GBP 142 million on the U.K. facility, and AUD 43.3 million on an Australian line. We think Penske Corporation or other Roger Penske-controlled entities could provide additional liquidity if needed but we see the firm in good financial health with what we see as ample room to take on debt for a large acquisition if needed.

24/11/2023,ConocoPhillips' 10-Year Plan Ensures Growth and Shareholder Returns ,ConocoPhillips,COP,2,03/11/2023,Allen Good,114.85,USD,23/11/2023,98.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,03/11/2023,"ConocoPhillips reported adjusted earnings fell to $2.6 billion in the third quarter, compared with $4.6 billion a year earlier on lower oil and gas prices. Despite the decline, earnings remain robust, supporting continued shareholder payouts. During the quarter, Conoco returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through its three-tier framework of ordinary and variable dividends and buybacks in the third quarter. The company also increased its regular dividend 14% to $0.58 per share given the ongoing strong results and favorable outlook. Production during the quarter grew by 52 mboe/d to 1,806 mboe/d. Adjusting for acquisitions and dispositions, production increased by 49 mboe/d as organic growth from the lower 48 states and other development programs more than offset the decline and downtime. Operating cash flow excluding working capital changes totaled $5.5 billion during the quarter, funding $2.5 billion of capital spending. Full-year capital expenditure guidance was unchanged.  During the quarter, Conoco purchased the remaining 50% interest in Surmont, a Canadian oil sands site, for $2.7 billion. Management updated guidance to account for the acquisition with full-year production now expected to be approximately 1.82 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 1.80 to 1.81 mboe/d previously. We plan to incorporate the latest guidance and results into our model along with an updated price deck, but we do not anticipate a material change in our $98 fair value estimate. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. Shares are overvalued, in our opinion, assuming a $60/bbl midcycle price. However, prices are currently well above that level and as demonstrated this quarter, management remains intent on returning excess cash to shareholders. We think this capital discipline combined with a high-quality asset base and leverage to commodity prices makes Conoco attractive, absent valuation.","A large position in the Permian offers low-cost liquids growth with wider margins, lower risk, and higher returns than international operations. Over the long term, management does not plan to increase activity with oil prices, instead directing excess cash flow toward repurchases with a payout target of 30% of cash flow. With a 10-year plan that includes a robust financial framework, focus on shareholder returns, and a low $35/bbl free cash flow breakeven level, management is demonstrating its commitment to capital discipline and making Conoco a viable long-term holding. ","Conoco is investing to reduce emissions, but not to diversify its business away from hydrocarbons, potentially risking future value destruction if demand declines faster than expected.  In the event of high oil prices, Conoco will abandon its capital discipline and increase investment, resulting in long-term lower returns on capital and risking shareholder returns. Tying cash returns to cash flow levels means that more repurchases are likely to take place during times of higher prices and thus higher share prices, risking value destruction.",15/05/2023,"Differentiating itself from peers big and small, ConocoPhillips has laid out a 10-year plan for restrained investment, steady growth, improving returns, and, importantly, returning cash to shareholders. Its strategy makes Conoco a compelling option in the energy sector, given its commitment to capital restraint and clear policy on return of cash to shareholders. Its low-cost portfolio gives it high return investment options to grow in a rising price environment while its strong financial position keeps the dividend safe in a downcycle. Central to its plan is a commitment to maintain capital spending at $11 billion on average annually while returning 30% of operating cash flow to shareholders per year through a three-tier capital return program consisting of buybacks, an ordinary annual dividend, and a variable component. Through high-grading and cost improvements, the company has reduced the oil price necessary to earn a 10% return on produced resource in its plan to under $40/barrel. Its growth plan rests largely on its unconventional assets, specifically its Permian position, which became the companys largest position with the acquisition of Concho Resources and later grew with the purchase of Shells Permian shale assets. It has since steadily improved its operational performance. Permian resources constitute the bulk of the planned produced resources in the 10-year plan, with production plateauing at around 1.2 mmboe/d by the end of the decade.  While the company holds acreage in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, production will only be held flat during the next decade. Outside of the U.S. unconventional portfolio, volumes will steadily grow during the next decade with Alaska and Canada offsetting declines internationally. Growth in Canada will come from the Montney, where Conoco plans to leverage its unconventional experience. New volumes in Alaska will come from leveraging existing infrastructure to grow around legacy assets and later the recently approved Willow project. LNG volume growth will come from participation in two Qatar expansion projects while also sourcing volumes from Port Arthur LNG in the U.S. ","We think ConocoPhillips has sufficiently improved its portfolio through cost reductions and divestitures, which combined with the addition of low-cost unconventional production growth warrants a narrow moat rating, as we now expect the company to deliver excess returns on capital at our midcycle oil price assumption of $60/barrel.In the last few years, ConocoPhillips has reshaped its portfolio by selling higher-cost, lower-return assets including natural gas production in the U.S. and Canada and bitumen production in Canada. Meanwhile, it acquired high-quality Permian acreage with the purchase of Concho Resources and additional acreage in the Delaware basin in the Shell asset acquisition. In total, production has remained flat since 2014, but divested volumes were largely natural gas, leaving higher-margin crude oil production at 53% of the portfolio compared with 39% previously.Meanwhile, the company has reduced its per-barrel operating costs nearly 30% from 2013 levels. Reductions were most pronounced in its conventional assets in Europe and Asia-Pacific/Middle East regions, where costs are down over 40%. These reductions are a critical driver of the improved portfolio as conventional production constitutes around 600 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, or about 40% of current production. Operating costs typically track movements in commodity prices, so based on our expectations for lower oil prices over the cycle as well as the introduction of new technological innovations, wed expect ConocoPhillips to hold on to the cost improvements during the next five years. ConocoPhillips unconventional portfolio includes positions in the Eagle Ford, Permian, and Bakken that produced about 1.0 mmboe/d in 2022, or about one third of total production, an holds about 12,000 remaining well locations. Production will continue to increase as investment is primarily directed to Lower 48 development including assets acquired from Concho and Shell in recent years. In the Permian, it holds 659,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin and another 251,000 in the Midland Basin. The Permian will drive the company's volume growth with production rising to a plateau level of 1.2 mmboe/d by the end of the decade from a little over 700 mboe/d in 2022Its Eagle Ford position, acquired at a low cost well before the shale boom, totals 199,000, essentially all in the higher-return oil or liquids window. In the Bakken, ConocoPhillips holds 560,000 acres. Volumes are unlikely to grow too much beyond current levels of about 315 mboe/d, but improvements in drilling times and other advancements means those levels can be preserved with half the number of rigs needed in 2016. Although the Permian tends to garner most of the headlines, ConocoPhillips Eagle Ford-dominated portfolio holds break-evens for new shale wells at $40/barrel and below. Rounding out ConocoPhillips portfolio are the liquefied natural gas assets, which produce about 220 mboe/d from projects in Qatar and Australia. While its Qatar assets rank as some of the best in the world, its Australia assets are more of a mixed bag. Like other LNG projects in Australia that were developed over the past decade, ConocoPhillips APLNG facility struggled with cost inflation that ultimately resulted in impairment charges when oil prices fell. However, with startup in 2016, the large capital requirements are behind it while the project benefits from relatively lower operating costs and proximity to Asian demand markets as well as a large resource base capable of producing at plateau levels for decades. It acquired another 10% of APLNG in early 2022 and is set to acquire another 2.49% interest.LNG low-cost volume growth will come from awarded interests in Qatar's North Field East and North Field South expansion projects which once complete near the end of the decade should bring Conoco's LNG production close to 300 mboed. In culmination, we expect ConocoPhillips to deliver midcycle returns on invested capital of 10.4%, above its 8.4% estimated cost of capital and in line with other narrow-moat E&Ps we cover.We have incorporated environmental, social, and governance risk into our moat evaluation, but most fall outside the 10-year narrow moat window or risk is not material or probable enough to cause material value destruction in the next 10 years. A carbon tax is likely to be implemented and will increase the price of end products to consumers, which will likely erode demand, though the impact on hydrocarbon demand remains more than a decade away. ConocoPhillips reported greenhouse gas intensity of 27 kg CO2e/boe (2021) is relatively high for its peer group due to its oil sands operations. However, it is investing to improve its emissions intensity and reduce methane leakage and flaring. Management aims to reduce emissions intensity by 50%-60% by 2030 compared with 2016 levels (previously 40%-50%) on both gross operated and net equity basis and set a target for zero routine flaring by 2025. Additionally, ConocoPhillips set a target in 2020 to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, these targets only concern Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while 90% of the full lifecycle of emissions from oil and gas occur during combustion (Scope 3), which lies outside the companys influence. Unlike peers, ConocoPhillips has shown little appetite for investing in low-carbon solutions or renewable energy generation.","We assign ConocoPhillips a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating based on fundamental exposure to commodity prices, evaluation of ESG risks, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system.A decline in oil and gas prices represents the largest source of risk to the company's future value. Persistently low oil and gas prices would harm cash flow and would probably force ConocoPhillips to reduce its capital spending plans or impair reserves. The company's larger projects run the risk of delays, cost inflation, and falling commodity prices, which could ruin their economics. Global operations and partnerships with national oil companies expose the company to the threat that governments could expropriate assets or modify contract terms. Based on our framework, ESG-related risks are not collectively material enough to alter our scenario analysis-determined rating. ESG-related risks include changes in policy related to climate change such as the implementation of a carbon tax that could result in higher costs, reduced demand, or stranded resources. ConocoPhillips operates in offshore environments and the Alaskan Arctic and is exposed to the risk of large oil spills that could result material losses through fines or penalties, loss of license to operate or lost revenue. Development of Alaskan assets also faces the risk of being blocked by the government due to environmental concerns. Long term, greater adoption of electric vehicles could significantly reduce demand for oil.","Based on our capital allocation framework, which evaluates soundness of the balance sheet, investment strategy, and appropriateness of shareholder distributions, ConocoPhillips earns an Exemplary rating.ConocoPhillips business has a medium amount of operating leverage as well as revenue cyclicality, while its strong balance sheet is able to absorb losses by increasing debt during times of low oil prices as seen in 2020. Since then, it has rapidly deleveraged and plans for further debt reduction through 2026, positioning to withstand another decline in oil prices. Overall, we rate ConocoPhillips balance sheet as sound in our framework. We rate ConocoPhillips investment strategy as exceptional. Its growth plan is restrained and largely focused on its unconventional assets, specifically in the Permian. The acquisition of Concho Resources fits this strategy and allows ConocoPhillips to leverage Conchos expertise in the Permian; it entails a combined resource base economical at less than $30/bbl. The deal was also done at a discount to our Concho fair value estimate at the time, suggesting Conoco didnt overpay. The more recent asset acquisition deal with Shell for its contiguous Permian assets covering 225 thousand net acres and production of 200 mboe/d by 2022, economical at less than $40/bbl. The all-cash transaction was valued at a net acre price of $15,600, higher than its Concho acquisition at approximately $10,000 per net acre. But accounting for the maturity and higher portion of proved developed reserves of the former Shell shale assets, Conoco is getting a good deal, in our view. Its strategy makes ConocoPhillips a compelling option in the energy sector, given its ability to flex growth based on commodity prices, which should avoid value-destructive growth.Conocos distribution plan is appropriate, in our view. By committing to return 30% of operating cash flow to shareholders, it ties cash returns to cash flow. Also, by keeping dividend growth modest and directing excess cash toward repurchases and a variable dividend, it avoids having to cut the regular dividend in down price cycles. The drawback, however, it that Conoco will likely be purchasing the most shares when oil prices are high, as that will result in the most cash flow, but also likely high share prices. This could be value-destructive over the long term, but that risk is tempered by the addition of the variable dividend which will result in direct cash returns as opposed to greater repurchases. On the whole, we like the flexible program as it preserves the balance sheet and is better suited to contend with future oil price volatility.","ConocoPhillips is a U.S.-based independent exploration and production firm. In 2022, it produced 1.2 million barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids and 3.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, primarily from Alaska and the Lower 48 in the United States and Norway in Europe and several countries in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Proven reserves at year-end 2022 were 6.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","Debt has fallen from the peak levels realized after the oil price decline in 2020 and the Concho acquisition. Total debt amounted to $16.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023, implying a net debt/capital ratio of 26%. Management will likely continue to reduce gross debt, targeting $15 billion by 2026, as it aims to maintain an A-rated balance sheet, which is a top priority. We expect debt/EBITDA to remain at or below 1.0 throughout the remainder of our forecast.ConocoPhillips maintains its plans to differentiate itself by focusing on shareholder returns. While it still aims to return 30% of operating cash flow to shareholders, management instated a three-tier capital return program to preserve flexibility in anticipation of oil price volatility. The first tier consists of an ordinary dividend that Conoco plans to increase annually in line with the broader market. The second tier is share repurchases, while the third tier is a variable dividend that is staggered, resulting in eight cash distributions per year when declared. In 2023, Conoco expects to return $11 billion to shareholders. Capital spending in 2023 is expected to be $11.0 billion and to remain around that level through 2032.",COP,Energy,136825266176.0,NYQ,4647059.0,USD,114.8499984741211,True,0,118.65188212675174,113.54222229380494,0
25/11/2023,Zscaler Is Setting Itself Up for Long-Term Success in a Competitive Security Market,Zscaler Inc,ZS,3,06/09/2023,Malik Khan,193.09,USD,24/11/2023,183.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,06/09/2023,"We raise our fair value estimate to $183 from $170 for narrow-moat Zscaler after the firm finished fiscal 2023 with strong financial results and guidance for the upcoming year. While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we were impressed by Zscalers ability to close a record number of deals with an annual contract value of more than $1 million. We attribute this strong performance upmarket to the impressive value proposition Zscalers platform offers its customers, especially as they seek cloud-native security vendors to manage their increasingly complex security needs. As we look ahead, we expect Zscalers products to remain top-of-mind for companies and so forecast robust growth for the firm over the next decade as investments in cloud-native security solutions ramp up. The firms shares traded slightly down after the earnings report, and we view them as marginally undervalued. Zscalers sales for the fourth quarter clocked in at $455 million, up 43% year over year and more than $20 million above the high end of managements prior guidance. Forward-looking metrics such as billings and deferred revenue also showed signs of continued strength, growing 38% and 41% year over year, respectively. Further, management provided strong billings guidance for fiscal 2024, indicating that Zscaler has a strong business pipeline ahead of it. Zscalers emerging products category, which includes workload protection, business analytics, and digital experience monitoring, was another bright spot for the quarter. Emerging products accounted for 18% of the firms new business, up from single digits a couple of years ago. We believe these new products provide Zscaler with a potent cross/up-selling sales motion in the future while entrenching its customers further, thereby reducing the likelihood of churn.","Zscaler has strong secular tailwinds behind its back as the convergence of networking and the security market is in its early innings. Zscaler has market leadership and high enterprise penetration through its offerings related to secure web gateways and zero-trust network access. Consolidation of security vendors should benefit Zscaler, which has a wide array of solutions across an enterprises network security stack.","Large public cloud vendors often offer their own cybersecurity solutions, which could hamper Zscalers growth opportunities. Zscaler faces competition from vendors like Palo Alto and Fortinet that have increasingly made investments in the key areas where Zscaler has a market-leading position. There always remains a risk that Zscaler may miss out on the next big technology, thereby allowing its competitors to catch up.",06/09/2023,"We see Zscaler as a pioneer and leader in zero-trust security solutions, an area of cybersecurity primed for growth due to secular trends such as increased digitization of an enterprise and a convergence of networking and security. We have a positive outlook on Zscalers solutions as the firm stands to materially benefit from these trends. The firm has built out a narrow economic moat by developing a sticky product portfolio (as evidenced by its strong net and gross retention metrics.) Zscalers bet was that, over time, enterprises would shift their network-traffic routing from a centralized node (typically the headquarters) to a decentralized direct-to-cloud route. Zscalers two key solutions, Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access, allow firms to directly connect to external and internal resources, respectively, without needing to route traffic through a centralized node. This shift in how network activity is routed comes at a time when an increasingly large share of enterprise workflows are cloud-based, as digital transformations and cloud migrations alter the IT makeup of enterprises. However, this change in traffic flow has also created a myriad of problems for enterprises. First, as the reliance on cloud-based resources has grown, the amount of network activity generated by these workflows has rapidly increased. Second, by decentralizing network traffic, there is a need for new security apparatuses and methods to secure the traffic. Last, this shift in network traffic is premised on a zero-trust security infrastructure that removes the risk of lateral mobility, a process in which a malicious actor gains access to one application and then uses its credentials to advance onto other applications. In this shifting landscape, we believe Zscalers solutions stand to be long-term winners. The companys products have found great enterprise demand, with Zscaler able to attract new customers and expand its customer base. While ZIA and ZPA are two key solutions, both of them consist of many individual modules that allow Zscaler to expand revenue from an existing client by either selling it more seats or increasing the usage of its solutions.","We assign Zscaler a narrow moat rating owing primarily to strong switching costs and secondarily to a network effort associated with its offerings. We believe Zscalers industry-leading zero-trust security solutions will continue to see robust enterprise adoption, allowing the firm to both retain and expand its footprint within existing organizations, while also allowing the company to land new customers. As a result, we forecast Zscaler to generate excess returns over invested capital over the next decade.As we look at the broader cybersecurity space, we believe the complexity and intensity of threats are ever-increasing. Enterprises continue to adopt SaaS solutions, undergo digital transformations, and migrate to the cloud, all while employees continue to work remotely part-time. In turn, we see the number of attack vectors (or entry points for nefarious players) rapidly growing. Similarly, the intensity of digital threats is also on the rise, with higher costs of a data breach, including punitive fines, for any customer data theft.These trends have rendered the traditional castle-and-moat version of enterprise cybersecurity obsolete. Traditionally, firewalls have stood guard outside corporate networks, inspecting traffic entering and exiting the network. However, with enterprises increasingly using cloud-based solutions (whether it be SaaS applications like Salesforce or public cloud vendors like AWS), the need for hardware firewalls to inspect network traffic is significantly reduced. Instead, enterprises have increasingly shifted to cloud-based solutions that provide a robust way to secure network activity stemming from and traveling within the cloud. In this shifting landscape, Zscalers zero-trust infrastructure allows enterprises to not only maintain a robust security posture but also eliminate areas of excessive IT spend by reducing reliance on costly hardware appliances. While the need for hardware firewalls still remains, we think that the market buying activity has heavily tilted toward cloud-based solutions such as Zscaler. We believe that the shift away from hardware firewalls is part of a broader convergence of networking and security (with Zscalers products materially benefiting from it).Zscalers solutions can be broadly portioned into two key areas: Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, which provides secure access to external applications (SaaS apps like Salesforce, Office 365, and so on) and Zscaler Private Access, or ZPA, which provides secure access to internally managed applications (which could include internal APIs, databases, and so on). Within each vertical, Zscaler provides a slew of modules ranging from sandboxes to application protection and browser isolation. By remaining agnostic to network, location, or device, Zscalers solutions can help enterprises create policies that secure access to both internal and external applications while being able to enact changes to these policies instantly at a companywide scale.We often see high switching costs for enterprise-focused cybersecurity vendors that often have an expansive footprint across an enterprise. To uproot such a vendor requires not only a competitive offering from another vendor, but often retraining staff to use the new set of security solutions, a period of increased vulnerability. Additionally, we believe security-related IT decisions are driven by security analysts and engineers that focus on performance, rather than price, so enterprises are unlikely to rip out cybersecurity solutions as a source of potential cost savings. Zscalers stickiness is evidenced by the firms high-90% gross retention rate and a solid net retention rate above 120%. Both metrics highlight the fact that existing customers not only keep on using Zscalers solutions but spend more on the company with the passage of time.Along with high switching costs, we believe a network effect reinforces Zscaler's economic moat. Cybersecurity, in its essence, is a data problem, and attacks are now too overwhelming to be handled manually. In turn, vendors have developed AI solutions to automate processes and pick up threats (especially never-seen-before, zero-day attacks). However, artificial intelligence and ML solutions are only as good as the data that is fed to them. This need for good-quality data is where we see vendors such as Zscaler having an edge as they have data streaming into their security solutions from across the enterprise. For some context, Zscalers security solutions monitor more than 250 billion requests each day, allowing the firm to monitor activity at a scale very few cybersecurity firms can.By collecting and analyzing this rich data coming into its platforms, a vendor such as Zscaler can uncover threats and new threat signatures that can then be used to update its entire client bases security posture. As more data comes in, Zscalers platforms become better at detecting and mitigating cyber threats. As a result, more customers opt for Zscalers solutions due to superior productswhich, in turn, leads to more data, and the flywheel spins faster. We see this network effect as reinforcing switching costs as wellwith customers hesitant to leave Zscaler as it may entail losing this shared threat-detection and response capability.","We assign Zscaler a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating due to the firm competing in the ever-shifting cybersecurity space. While Zscaler has positioned itself well to benefit from secular tailwinds such as a shift to zero-trust security and the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity space is known for its rapid pace of development. With this in mind, large incumbents such as Zscaler that have performed exceptionally well in particular verticals stand to be disrupted by upstarts that could offer better performance in key modules. To stay ahead of the pack, Zscaler has invested a great deal of capital in building out its ZIA and ZPA solutions. However, a shifting demand landscape coupled with newer products that impact Zscalers competitive positioning are a risk for the firm.Much like other software firms, Zscaler invests heavily in its sales and research departments. Due to the high spending in these verticals, the firm is yet to achieve GAAP profitability. While we firmly believe in Zscalers long-term opportunity, we think that to bask in the light at the end of the tunnel, Zscaler will have to execute well in the coming years.Regarding environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, we do not foresee any material ESG issues, or MEIs. However, notable potential risks include attracting and retaining talent, which could demand high remuneration amid a talent shortage in cybersecurity. Also, Zscalers solutions are tasked with protecting customers from cyberattacks, making data privacy and security a key concern.","We assign Zscaler an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.CEO and chair Jay Chaudhry has been at the helm since the companys inception. His ideas and vision have allowed the firm to carve its niche in the broader cybersecurity market, and we have no reason to doubt that his leadership will facilitate the firm achieving durable growth and profitability.We think Zscalers balance sheet is in good shape. With a strong cash and liquid investments reserve and positive cash flow margins, we are not overly concerned by the firm's use of debt. Further, we think that the stickiness of the firm's product portfolio reduces downside risk in the event of an economic downturn.Zscalers investment strategy has been stellar over the last few years. The firm wagered heavily on the convergence of networking and security by investing significant capital in building out products that service the needs of enterprises as they reduce their reliance on hardware firewalls. The firms two main product segments, ZIA and ZPA, both have found customer appetite, and the firms investments in organically developing these solutions will reap rewards in the coming years.Since Zscaler has been aggressively expanding its business, the company does not pay its shareholders a dividend and has no plans on starting one soon. We see this strategy as appropriate given the firms potential growth prospects across network security.","Zscaler is a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, firm focusing on providing cloud-native cybersecurity solutions to primarily enterprise customers. Zscalers offerings can be broadly partitioned into Zscaler Internet Access, which provides secure access to external applications, and Zscaler Private Access, which provides secure access to internal applications. The firm is headquartered in San Jose, California, and went public in 2018.","We view Zscalers financial position as healthy. The firm ended fiscal 2023 with around $1.3 billion in cash and liquid investments. While Zscaler does carry debt of around $1.1 billion on its balance sheet, we believe that the firms cash reserves coupled with its ability to generate healthy cash flow from its business will be sufficient to cover its commitments over our explicit forecast.While the firm has not posted GAAP profitability, Zscalers FCFE (free cash flow to equity) margins have been in the black since 2018 and reached 23% in 2023. We expect Zscalers cash generation to improve as the firm increases its operating leverage by toning down some of its research and sales expenditures.Going forward, we do not expect to see a material change in Zscalers capital structure. In a tight macro environment, if the need arises, we expect the firm to raise capital by issuing more equity.",ZS,Technology,29376958464.0,NMS,2475115.0,USD,193.08999633789065,True,0,159.1948236802094,220.8974389797354,1
25/11/2023,PPG Navigates Moderating Paint Demand but Easing Inflation Should Benefit Margins,PPG Industries Inc,PPG,3,19/10/2023,Spencer Liberman,136.45,USD,24/11/2023,117.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,19/10/2023,"Narrow-moat PPG reported solid third-quarter results that were largely in line with our expectations. PPG is navigating a challenging operating environment where higher interest rates weigh on architectural paint demand and global industrial production remains soft in most regions. That said, PPG's price increases and strength in smaller markets like automotive original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, and aerospace have helped offset these challenges. Management noted raw material availability and supply chain conditions continued to improve and have moderated to historical levels, which we think should provide some margin relief going into next year. We've increased our fair value estimate to $117 from $115 per share due to time value of money. The performance coatings segment continued to perform well as net sales rose almost 7% year over year due to the realization of previously announced selling price increases despite flat volumes. Persistent softness in the North American do-it-yourself market as well as weak demand for architectural coatings in EMEA weighed heavily on volumes in the quarter. Once again, PPG's Comex business in Mexico capitalized on strong demand in the region and saw record sales for the 13th straight quarter. We continue to be impressed by the performance in PPG's Comex business and we expect it will buoy the segment through the rest of the year. The industrial coatings group continued to benefit from strength in automotive OEM markets as global auto production rebounds, but softness in global industrial production hampered the segment during the quarter. Despite current macroeconomic headwinds, management raised its adjusted EPS guidance to $7.61 (midpoint) from $7.38 (midpoint) previously. While we expect tepid demand in North American DIY and European architectural coatings through the end of the year, strength in automotive OEM coatings and PPG's Comex business should provide an avenue for the company to achieve its revised guidance.","The company operates in a diverse range of end markets, leading to stable earnings even during industry-specific slowdowns. Consolidation has characterized the coating industry during the past decade, and PPG can capture additional share as consolidation continues. PPGs expanded partnership with Home Depot increases its professional paint line at the retailer. This strategy could increase PPGs market share in the professional paint market. ","PPG has a focus on the lower-margin and highly competitive industrial coatings market. Its architectural business is only a third of total revenue.  Despite a diversified customer base, PPG's profitability is not immune to economic slowdowns, as seen in 2008 and 2009, when operating margin dropped below 10% for the first time in a decade. PPGs push into the North American professional paint market will face stiff competition and is unlikely to take market share from wide-moat Sherwin Williams. ",19/10/2023,"PPG Industries is a globally diversified producer of paints and coatings. The company is the world's largest producer of coatings after the purchase of selected Akzo Nobel assets. PPG's products are sold to a wide variety of end users, including the automotive, aerospace, construction, and industrial markets. The company has a footprint in many regions around the globe, with less than half of sales coming from North America in recent years. PPG is focused on growing its coatings and specialty product offerings and expanding into emerging regions, as exemplified by the Comex acquisition. PPG is organized into two segments, performance coatings and industrial coatings. Performance coatings (60% of sales) supplies architectural, aerospace, and protective coatings that are generally sold after the manufacturing of the underlying good. Architectural coatings make up roughly half of the segment, with PPGs products usually on the lower end of the value chain. Recently, PPG announced it has expanded its partnership with Home Depot. This expansion should increase the firms exposure to the architectural market in North America. The industrial coatings segment (40% of sales) supplies coatings used in auto, packaging, metals, and industrial equipment manufacturing. The company generates more than $17 billion in sales each year, growing at GDP-like rates. To supplement growth, the firm has been a serial acquirer of relatively small bolt-on businesses. It typically looks for coatings technologies that it doesn't currently have, with the intent to scale the production of that new offering across its facilities worldwide. The global coatings industry is highly fragmented, which should keep this strategy viable for the foreseeable future. That said, we generally dislike acquisition-dependent strategies due to the heightened risk of shareholder value destruction. ","We think PPG benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. We assign PPG a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and switching costs. The company participates in most architectural paint markets while also selling into industrial end markets such as new autos, refinish and collision, packaging, and aerospace. This diversity makes it hard for the company to materially under- or outperform the broader coatings space, given the relatively small contribution each business makes on its own. Within the company's performance coatings segment (61% of sales), architectural coatings account for roughly half of the segments revenue. In the architectural market, PPG is known as the lower cost alternative to premium suppliers like Sherwin-Williams and Behr. PPG sells its architectural coatings through its partnership with Home Depot, other regional and national retail outlets, and through its network of roughly 800 company owned retail stores (a comparatively small footprint relative to Sherwin's 4,800 stores). The remaining half of the performance coatings segment is in aerospace, and automotive refinish, and protective coatings that are generally sold after the manufacture of the underlying good. Many of these products are sold direct to consumer and through company-owned or independent distribution networks.The industrial coatings segment accounts for the remaining 39% of PPG's sales and are generally applied to products during manufacturing. These paints and coatings are sold direct to the manufacturer and are usually specifically formulated to meet the clients needs. This dynamic creates a stickiness that is not obtained in the architectural paint market.While PPG might not have the same brand recognition and reputation as Sherwin-Williams, we think PPGs brand commands enough pricing power to support an intangible asset moat source. From architectural to industrial applications, PPG is a globally recognized brand. In the architectural market, PPG offers a lower cost alternative that still delivers quality results for both amateur and professional painters. For amateur painters, the low-cost nature of PPGs consumer focused paint lines has made them a favorite for consumers looking to paint on a budget. Many of these consumers are working on one-time small projects, so they are less concerned about overall paint quality and application efficiency compared with professional painters.As compared with its peer Sherwin-Williams, we believe PPG is less advantaged in architectural coatings, especially in the professional paint market. PPG has built out a network of roughly 800 stores in North America, well behind the 4,500-plus Sherwin-Williams stores. For professional painters, retail stores provide a convenient and consistent way to purchase paint and supplies. The lack of scale of PPGs retail stores and lower paint quality inhibits the firms ability to compete with Sherwin-Williams in the professional market. Nevertheless, PPGs lines of professional and amateur architectural paint are sold in all Home Depot stores, alongside the premium Behr brand. PPGs Home Depot lineup was expanded in 2022 to include more paint products designed for professional painters. This partnership provides PPG with an additional avenue to sell its products, but we dont think this will be enough to materially capture share of the professional paint market. PPGs industrial coatings products are usually applied in a manufacturing setting before a product is completed and sold. This includes OEMs across automotive, packaging, construction equipment, consumer electronics, and more. Many of the products sold in the industrials coating segment are specifically formulated for the customer. These customers are stickier than those purchasing architectural coatings as the products are far less commoditized. Given that coating is generally embedded as a step within the broader production process, factors like dry time, cure time, and abrasion resistance can affect the pace or process throughout the remainder of assembly. Accordingly, a coating switch has costly implications for only a marginal savings per unit. Many manufacturing facilities operate at high efficiencies to maintain output and margins. Downtime related to switching coatings and potentially replacing specialized equipment is a large deterrent for most firms.","We assign PPG a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. From a fundamental perspective, we believe a potential slowdown in global GDP growth elevates the company's risk profile. PPG has diverse geographic exposure and operates in a wide array of end markets, ranging from architectural to highly specialized industrial applications. PPG has historically grown at GDP-like rates, and the firm tends to move with the global economic cycle. Coatings companies can experience considerable margin compression during a downturn, especially if the housing market weakens considerably. PPGs acquisition strategy puts the firm at an additional risk. The success of future acquisitions is uncertain, and a variety of factors, such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance, could destroy shareholder value. The firm's profit margins are also affected by oil and titanium dioxide price volatility. Rising input costs can strain margins, and it can take time before the company can pass on commensurate price increases. PPG is exposed to a couple of environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of the firm's products and services and carbon emissions from the firm's operation. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. PPG has a history of developing environmentally friendly products and has grown its portfolio of environmentally friendly products. Over 35% of sales are generated from sustainable products and services, representing roughly $5 billion of sales. The firm also receives approximately 21% of its electricity from renewable sources. We expect the firm's product leadership and its commitment to environmentally friendly products and lower carbon emissions to continue.","We assign PPG a Standard capital allocation rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, satisfactory investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.PPGs balance sheet is sound, in our view. We believe the firm's leverage is reasonable considering its stable profitability and strong free cash flow generation. While leverage has increased in recent years, the company has kept its net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.5 for the last decade, and management remains committed to maintaining an investment-grade debt rating. We view PPGs investment strategy as satisfactory. The company's acquisition strategy has boosted its growth prospects and expanded its end markets. While none of PPG's major deals strike us as highly value-dilutive, academic evidence historically suggests that M&A tends to cede most of its benefits to the seller. The success of future acquisitions is uncertain, and a variety of factors--such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance--could destroy shareholder value. Nevertheless, we expect PPGs returns on invested capital to sit well above its weighted average cost of capital.We believe PPGs shareholder distributions are appropriate. The firms acquisition strategy requires significant capital, which can hinder its ability to distribute cash to shareholders. That said, PPG has consistently paid a dividend with steady annual increases. The firm tends to repurchase shares at a lesser rate than its peers. When the firm does repurchase shares, we believe it does so at acceptable prices.","PPG is a global producer of coatings. The company is the world's largest producer of coatings after the purchase of selected Akzo Nobel assets.

PPG is focused on its coatings and specialty products and expansion into emerging regions, as exemplified by the Comex acquisition.","We think PPG has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt-service requirements and future capital-allocation decisions. Given PPGs acquisitive strategy, liquidity is an important metric to monitor. PPG has managed its leverage well, keeping net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.5 over the last 10 years. While management has no explicit long-term leverage targets, we expect the company will maintain an investment-grade rating on its debt. PPG has roughly $6.5 billion of outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2044. PPG has ample liquidity, with over $1 billion of cash on hand and no outstanding borrowings on a $2.2 billion credit facility. PPG has a history of strong free cash flow generation, and we expect the company to maintain its sound capital structure.",PPG,Basic Materials,33867954176.0,NYQ,1462135.0,USD,136.4499969482422,True,0,133.4569413129035,143.03036536239512,1
24/11/2023,Republic Services' Pricing Power Supports Margin Expansion,Republic Services Inc,RSG,2,27/10/2023,Brian Bernard,160.01,USD,23/11/2023,129.0,Low,Wide,Standard,A,27/10/2023,"Wide-moat-rated Republic Services reported third-quarter operating results in line with our estimates, as sales and operating income were within 1% of our projections. Management increased full-year adjusted EPS guidance by 2% to $5.48 per share (midpoint) due to a lower-than-anticipated tax rate while leaving guidance unchanged for sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. We've increased our fair value estimate to $129 per share from $127 due to the time value of money. Pricing has remained robust for Republic Services, as the core price for related business increased 8.6%. We continue to believe that Republic Services can exert pricing power for the foreseeable future, as the firm continues to benefit from its wide economic moat from intangible assets (landfill permits) and cost advantages (route density). We do note, however, that volume growth came in at 0.1%, its lowest level since the first quarter of 2021. This is largely due to declines in construction and demolition volumes that fell 6.2% year over year due to weakness in the economy. Additionally, residential collection volumes declined 1.5% year over year, which is the worst-performing quarter on a volume basis since the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margins have remained robust for Republic Services, increasing 70 basis points year over year (to 29.9%), largely due to continued operational improvement, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Republic Services relied less on acquisitions during the quarter, as acquisitions only accounted for 1.7% of the companys year-over-year growth; however, management emphasized that it continues to seek acquisition opportunities. Also of note, Republic announced that the board of directors approved a $3 billion share repurchase plan effective at the start of 2024 through the end of 2026. This is in addition to the remaining purchase capacity under the prior repurchase plan of $1.4 billion, which extends through the end of 2023.",Republics traditional solid waste operations should continue to perform well due to solid execution and strong pricing. Significant investments are planned for renewable energy generation and recycling projects. These projects should support stronger earnings and free cash flow growth and raise the firm's already strong ESG profile. Republic enjoys robust competitive advantages rooted in intangible assets (regulatory permits for landfills) and cost advantages (route density).,"The acquisition of US Ecology could underperform Republic Services' business case, resulting in shareholder destruction. Many U.S. municipalities are gradually pushing for greater solid waste reduction and recycling, which could temper the level of higher-margin waste entering Republics landfills over the long run. Recycling segment operating costs could rise as the company strives to meet increasingly stringent contamination standards for recycled commodities.",27/10/2023,"Following right behind industry leader Waste Management, Republic Services enjoys dominance in landfill ownership. As a fully integrated waste hauler, it leverages a vast network of collection routes and transfer stations, which bestow significant control over the waste stream, funneling trash from commercial, industrial, and residential end markets into its landfills. Outside of the large public providers that make up 40% of industry revenue, size falls off quickly and the market becomes fragmented. Republic in its current form was born out of the 2008 merger of Allied Waste and Republic Services, which forged the second-largest U.S.-based solid waste company. The timing of the transaction was less than ideal due to the ensuing economic recession. However, since then, Republic has executed well amid the economic recovery. Volume growth returned, pricing strengthened, and adjusted operating margin returned to over 17%. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow exceeded Republic's 2019 performance, and the firm saw further EBITDA margin improvement in 2021. EBITDA margin moderated in 2022 but remained strong. Republics recycling division encountered painful headwinds as prices for recycled commodities the company extracts and sells, particularly old corrugated cardboard, plummeted on Chinas decision to suspend most import licenses in early 2018. These headwinds abated as the company repriced contracts, managed facility costs, and benefited from increased recycled commodity pricing. However, recycled commodity prices retreated in 2022 compared with elevated 2021 pricing and are trending lower in 2023.  We expect Republic to continue focusing on tuck-in acquisitions. Its ability to raise core price on acquired volume (thanks to its vast ownership of landfills) should support solid free cash flow generation in the years ahead. Republic completed its acquisition of US Ecology in May 2022. Cross-selling synergies are a key component of the business case, and management is targeting $75 million-$100 million of revenue synergies along with $40 million of cost synergies. We believe Republic will exceed these synergy targets.","We assign Republic Services a wide economic moat rating because we have very high confidence in the firm's ability to generate excess returns over the next 10 years, and we think it's more likely than not that excess returns will persist over the next 20 years. Republic has a large amount of goodwill on its balance sheet from its 2008 merger with Allied Waste, and this dynamic has resulted in a relatively narrow spread between the firm's return on invested capital and its cost of capital. However, considering the firm's competitive advantages, we're confident this spread will persist. Furthermore, if we look past the goodwill generated from this merger, Republic's ROICs are in the low teens.We believe that intangible assets stemming from its irreplicable landfill footprint are Republic's primary and most durable moat source. Federal and state regulations and not-in-my-backyard activism have made its very costly to operate and close landfills and extremely difficult to receive approval for new landfills. As such, the number of landfills has fallen from approximately 10,000 in 1980 to only about 1,500 today. Small landfill owners couldn't afford to implement environmental requirements such as plastic linings and leachate and methane recovery equipment and were replaced by large regional landfills. Today, we estimate that public companies own or manage 60% of municipal solid waste landfills, including life-of-site agreements to operate municipal-owned landfills. Republic's landfill count (206) trails Waste Management's 259 but is more than twice Waste Connections' 100. Landfill scarcity has supported pricing power for Republic with annual core price increases consistently exceeding inflation. Furthermore, Republic can generate profits (through tipping fees) from competitors that don't own landfills or own landfills that are located too far away to be cost competitive.Because disposal costs are the most significant expense for waste haulers, owning well-placed disposal assets (landfill and transfer stations) can yield a cost advantage in local markets over competitors that transport waste over longer distances. However, cost advantages related to the proximity of disposal assets wouldn't persist without the presence of intangible assets. Transfer stations (which require permits to operate) are extensions of landfills that consolidate and compact waste into high-volume transfer vehicles. Transfer stations can reduce disposal costs, but significant waste volumes are needed to yield favorable economics.The largest public waste collection and disposal businesses have been able to expand existing landfills, but regulations and NIMBY make it difficult for even the largest, most powerful players to construct new landfills. However, if regulations were relaxed and landfill construction costs decreased, we think that there would still be limited incentives for new entrants because waste disposal has most of the characteristics of an efficient scale marketmature demand, excess capacity (existing landfills have long useful lives), commodity products, inelastic demand, and high sunk costsand new entrants would lower the industry's returns below the cost of capital. Route density has the capacity to provide cost advantages for firms with significant local scale. Scale matters in route-based businesses (in this case, collection through disposal) because it provides greater utilization and leverage over a vast cost base (costs linked to landfill ownership, collection equipment, transfer facilities, and so on). In our view, Republic benefits from its significant route density.We believe the major waste management companies, including Republic Services, face low environmental, social, and governance risk. This may come as a surprise, given the dirty work these companies perform (that is, garbage hauling and disposal). However, the waste business is highly regulated, and these firms have spent billions of dollars to reduce the environmental impact from their operations.Republic is still exposed to environmental risk because mishandling waste could result in substantial fines and remediation costs and damage community relations. Even so, the firm has a strong record and has mitigating controls and processes in place to minimize environmental risk from mishandled waste. Republic also faces environmental risk tied to the greenhouse gas emissions from its landfills and large truck fleet. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, landfills accounted for 17% of U.S. methane emissions in 2019. However, the industry continues to heavily invest in clean technology to capture landfill gas and convert it into electricity and renewable natural gas. The industry has also been replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with ones powered by electricity and compressed natural gas. Currently, natural gas powers more than 20% of Republic Services' fleet.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Republic Services is Low. We view price competition, acquisition risk, and recycled-commodity price volatility as the key sources of valuation uncertainty for Republic. Republic Services' predictable recurring revenue streams and strong competitive positioning allow the firm to generate dependable free cash flow. Nevertheless, Republic competes with many hundreds of small, local, and regional waste collection operations. While many of these providers arent fully integrated with landfill assets and may not enjoy the same level of profitability as Republics network, most are nonetheless competent operators, and a large number of players keeps the pricing backdrop competitive, especially during periods of sluggish macroeconomic growth. Republic is a serial acquirer. Although its traditional solid waste tuck-in acquisitions have largely proved to be value-accretive, in our view, this strategy inherently carries risk that the company overreaches or overpays in a large transaction that dilutes capital returns, especially as the firm ventures into the adjacent environmental services market.Republic sells processed recycled materials (for example, cardboard, plastics, and aluminum) to third parties. Recycled commodity prices are volatile and can materially affect Republic's revenue and profit margin.","We assign Republic Services a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our assessment of the firm's financial health, investment strategy, and shareholder distribution policy.We believe Republic Services has a sound balance sheet. The firm operates with a reasonable amount of leverage for the industry (we forecast about a 2.3 average net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio over the next three years), and we expect its future free cash flow will be more than enough to cover upcoming debt maturities.We assess Republic Services' investment strategy as satisfactory. The firm operates in a capital-intensive industry. Between 1999 and 2022, we calculate that Republic allocated $38 billion of shareholder capital to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, and capital returns to shareholders. Of that $38 billion, 45% was used for capital expenditures. We expect management will continue to invest in technology to boost the firm's network efficiency and reduce the environmental impact from its operations. Republic Services has also invested heavily in clean technology that harnesses its landfills to generate renewable energy. Since 1999, Republic Services has spent over $9 billion on acquisitions. We expect it will continue to consolidate the industry, leveraging its superior scale and operating experience to extract cost synergies from its smaller acquisition targets. We believe Republic Services' shareholder distribution policy is appropriate. After investing in capital expenditures, management has historically employed a balanced and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Of the $38 billion of shareholder capital spent between 1999 and 2022, about 18% and 16% was used to fund share repurchases and dividends, respectively.CEO Jon Vander Ark succeeded Don Slager, who had led the company since 2011 before retiring, in June 2021. Vander Ark previously held several different roles at Republic, including president, COO, and executive vice president, operations. Brian DelGhiaccio was promoted to CFO in June 2020 after Republic's former finance chief, Charles Serianni, retired. DelGhiaccio joined Republic in 1998 and last served as chief transformation officer before his promotion.","Republic Services is the second-largest integrated provider of traditional solid waste services in the United States, operating roughly 206 active landfills and 233 transfer stations. The company serves residential, commercial, and industrial end markets. It also runs a sizable recycling operation in North America.","At the end of the third quarter, Republic Services had approximately $12.1 billion of outstanding debt and $2.3 billion of liquidity. We estimate the firm's gross debt/2023 EBITDA ratio is about 2.8. We expect management will prioritize paying down debt after the US Ecology acquisition, and we expect the leverage ratio to remain below 3.0. While Republic has a significant amount of outstanding debt, it generates strong and stable free cash flow, so we're not concerned about its ability to service its debt. Between 2023 and 2027, we forecast Republic will generate approximately $10.3 billion of cumulative free cash flow.",RSG,Industrials,51575296000.0,NYQ,950198.0,USD,160.00999450683594,True,0,148.7627062629247,172.02024671766793,1
24/11/2023,"JR Central's Earnings Are Recovering Strongly, but Returns to Be Diluted by Chuo Shinkansen",Central Japan Railway Co,9022,3,21/11/2023,Adrian Atkins,3532.0,JPY,24/11/2023,3400.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,21/11/2023,"Narrow-moat-rated JR Central had a strong first-half fiscal 2024 as passenger numbers bounced back, beating management's expectations and our own. First-half operating income, or EBIT, jumped 82% to JPY 312 billion, leading management to upgrade full-year guidance by 17% to JPY 502 million on stronger-than-expected passenger demand and lower-than-expected fuel costs. We upgrade our fair value estimate 6% to JPY 3,400 per share after upgrading our earnings forecasts. At current prices, the stock screens as fairly valued. The medium-term outlook is good but there are significant construction risks around the massive Chuo Shinkansen project. Ultimately, Chuo is expected to hurt earnings when it opens, as it largely duplicates the firm's existing Tokaido Shinkansen--adding more to costs than it does to revenue. The line from Tokyo to Nagoya is expected to open in 2028 and stretch to Osaka by 2037. Operating earnings in the transportation segment increased 81% to JPY 290 billion in the first half on recovery of passenger demand. Transportation revenue in the first half was 92% of prepandemic levels, compared with 70% in the prior corresponding period, or PCP. Inbound tourism has been a key driver of the recovery, evidenced by weekend passenger volumes on the Tokaido Shinkansen being regularly above pre-COVID-19 levels. As with peers, business usage has been slower to recover, mainly because of the increasing use of web conferencing. While the firm is yet to get agreement to traverse Shizuoka Prefecture, we don't expect this to be a major holdup. Smaller segments also recovered strongly. Merchandise operating income in the first half doubled to JPY 6 billion on greater foot traffic, and real estate operating income increased 22% to JPY 12 billion on higher rents and an increase in housing sales. The other segment, which includes hotels and travel agency services, increased operating income to JPY 5 billion, from a small loss in the PCP.","JR Central owns Japan's premier Shinkansen, which faces little competition from competing modes of transportation. The operating environment remains favorable to regulated railway operators in Japan. Under the cost-plus method, the company can pass on the vast majority of input cost increases to passengers. JR Central owns high-quality infrastructure and property assets, which generate defensive cash flows.","The Chuo Shinkansen project is huge and complex. Further construction cost overruns are possible.  The Chuo Shinkansen will dilute overall returns and is emblematic of government pressure on JR companies to invest in nation building projects.  Returns are at risk from Japan's aging demographics and shrinking population, natural disasters, and potential regulatory changes. ",21/11/2023,"Central Japan Railway Company, or JR Central, is the main railway operator in Nagoya and the Chubu region in central Japan. It serves far fewer passengers than JR East but what JR Central lacks in scale, it makes up for with quality, owning Japan's premier high-speed rail linethe Tokaido Shinkansen. The Tokaido Shinkansen dominates passenger transport along its route, which spans Japan's most wealthy and populous area and links Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Osaka. Competition is minimal given the Shinkansen's unbeatable departure frequency, convenience, travel times, safety, and reliability.  The Tokaido Shinkansen contributes about three-fourths of group revenue, with most of the balance from merchandise, conventional train lines and real estate investments. Basic ticket prices are regulated using a building block approach to calculate a fair return for investors after covering costs. Returns are enhanced by extra charges for seat reservations, first class seats, and non-Shinkansen express trains.  The company's focus is on building the new magnetic levitation, or maglev, Chuo Shinkansen linking Tokyo and Osaka. The project is designed to diversify risk, take some burden off the aging Tokaido Shinkansen and contribute to a rejuvenation of Japan. It is a huge project that is forecast to cost more than JPY 10 trillion, largely because 80% of the route will be underground, and complete in 2037. It will be funded primarily from retained earnings and JPY 3 trillion of long-dated, low-cost loans from the government. Traveling at 500 kilometers per hour and burrowing under mountains and urban areas on a more direct route, the Chuo Shinkansen is expected to halve transit times between Tokyo and Osaka to just 67 minutes, cementing JR Central's dominance on this corridor.  We expect strong earnings growth in the near term as the pandemic impact fades, but earnings will likely fall sharply when the Chuo Shinkansen opens because of additional costs and cannibalization of the Tokaido's revenue, which will continue to operate. Input cost inflation, secular population decline, and rising interest rates could also be earnings headwinds.  ","We believe JR Central has a narrow economic moat based on efficient scale, where new entrants are discouraged by expected low returns from duplicating the rail network. It also benefits from a service territory monopoly.Returns on invested capital prior to the pandemic were very strong at close to 10% and we forecast an average of 6% during the next five years. However, we forecast ROIC falls to just 3.5% when the Chuo Shinkansen opens, based on management's long-term earnings forecasts, as it will add significant costs and cannibalize revenue from the Tokaido Shinkansen. While low, we think returns will marginally exceed JR Central's cost of capital for long enough to justify a narrow moat given about half its debt is locked in for 30 years at an interest rate of just 0.86%. We preclude a wide moat rating because of unpredictable regulation, government pressure to invest in nation-building projects, and risks of delays and cost blowouts of the huge Chuo maglev development project.Japans high population density along the Pacific Coast is highly conducive to efficient railway transportation. Being fast, convenient, and affordable, train transportation is by far the most popular mode of transport in Japan. It commands a roughly two-thirds share of domestic passenger transportation kilometers, with planes, buses, and private cars each holding shares of a little over 10%. Rail faces modest competition from low-cost coaches, but these are typically less convenient, slower, and more dangerous. Similarly, air transportation is slower except for very long distances after considering time spent traveling to and from airports, and checking in. Typically, flying is only faster if the train trip is more than three hours. The Tokaido Shinkansen can complete the journey from Tokyo to Osaka in 134 minutes and the maglev Chuo will halve the time to 67 minutes, cementing JR Central's dominance on this route. Due to rail's structural advantages, the government retains heavy influence over JR Central via regulation. Japan's railways operate under a cost-plus system, with regular fare resets to incorporate changes to the economic environment. The regulator sets a cap on basic ticket prices based on a building block approach to provide a fair return to investors after covering optimal operating costs, depreciation, interest costs, and taxes. JR Central can increase prices for non-Shinkansen express tickets, first class tickets, and seat reservation charges without regulatory approval to earn excess returns. However, if total revenue exceeds the regulated allowance, then the regulator wont increase basic fares further.","We assign JR Central a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, with relatively defensive revenue and a positive medium-term outlook balanced by risks relating to the massive Chuo Shinkansen project. Other risks include potential adverse regulatory changes, larger-than-anticipated rises in interest rates, natural disasters, and the impact of secular population decline. The cost of the multidecade Chuo Shinkansen project has already increased significantly from original estimates, and further cost blowouts remain a risk given the complexity of the project, rising inflation, and the weak Japanese yen. Fortunately, it is being conservatively funded mainly from retained earnings. JR Central's rail networks are regulated. Changes to the regulatory system could hurt earnings. For example, regulation could be broadened to incorporate first class ticket prices and seat reservation charges. With JPY 5 trillion in debt, rising interest rates could weigh heavily on net income and credit metrics. Japan's aging demographics and declining population pose a risk to passenger demand. With high fixed costs, falling usage could have an outsize impact on efficiency and earnings. The population in Japan has been in decline since 2011.We believe ESG risks are low, given trains are more environmentally friendly than alternatives such as cars, buses and planes, and the firm is investing in renewable energy generation to reduce carbon emissions. Other ESG risks include not maintaining acceptable safety and reliability standards, but we think this is unlikely given the firm's strong track record and appropriate maintenance budget. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis could damage assets and hurt financial performance but would most likely be temporary setbacks. ","We assign JR Central a Standard Capital Allocation rating based on its sound financial health, fair investment efficacy, and low shareholder distributions. JR Central is in sound financial health. Credit metrics weakened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw earnings plummet and debt grow. While credit metrics are improving in the near term as earnings rebound, they are likely to worsen again as construction of the Chuo Shinkansen pushes net debt higher. Credit metrics will also likely take a hit when the Chuo opens, as we expect cannibalization of the Tokaido Shinkansen's revenue and a significant increase in operating costs. We forecast net debt/EBITDA below 4 times in coming years increasing to over 5 times in the longer term. Overall, we are comfortable with JR Central's financial position given its defensive earnings, long dated debt, conservative dividend payout ratio, and ability to slow construction activity if necessary. We rate investment efficacy as fair. We expect the firm to spend more than JPY 10 trillion building the Chuo Shinkansen. While it will cement JR Central's dominance on the Tokyo-to-Osaka corridor, low returns are expected and there is significant risk of cost overruns given the complexity of the project and cost inflation. JR Central also incurs substantial maintenance costs, mainly relating to the rail network. This is necessary spend to maintain the safety and reliability of the network. Shareholder distributions are low. Prior to the pandemic, dividend payout ratio averaged 8%. With relatively high financial leverage and huge amounts to spend on the Chuo Shinkansen, we forecast payout ratio averaging just 10% over the next decade. Share buybacks are unlikely in the foreseeable future. ","Central Japan Railway Company, or JR Central, is the main railway operator in Nagoya and the Chubu region in central Japan. It was originally established when the government-owned nationwide railway operator underwent a six-way territorial split in 1987. Its main asset is the Tokaido Shinkansen, which spans Japan's most wealthy and populous area and links Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Osaka. It contributes three-fourths of revenue, with most of the balance from merchandise, conventional train lines, and real estate. ","JR Central's financial health is sound. Credit metrics deteriorated sharply during the pandemic but are improving as earnings recover and because of a very conservative dividend payout ratio. Net debt/EBITDA was 1.6 times in fiscal 2019 prior to the pandemic and 4.3 times in fiscal 2023. We forecast improvement to below 4 in the near term, before lifting over 5 times in fiscal 2028 as net debt increases on construction of the Chuo Shinkansen. Further, EBITDA is likely to fall when the Chuo Shinkansen opens, given cannibalization of revenue from the Tokaido Shinkansen and a significant increase in operating costs. While financial leverage is high, we are comfortable with the firm's financial health given it boasts defensive earnings, a low dividend payout ratio, and a long weighted average debt maturity. In 2017, JR Central borrowed JPY 3 trillion from the government to help fund the Chuo Shinkansen. This debt must be repaid from 2047 to 2057 and carries an average interest rate of just 0.86%. JR Central has a solid investment-grade credit rating. ",9022.T,Industrials,3443986006016.0,JPX,1883400.0,JPY,3532.0,True,0,3570.012195121951,3694.3164556962024,1
25/11/2023,"Near Term Demand Remains Challenged, But Fastenal Can Still Invest in The Future",Fastenal Co,FAST,2,12/10/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,60.96,USD,24/11/2023,48.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,A,12/10/2023,"Our $48 fair value estimate for Fastenal remains unchanged following third-quarter earnings. The market sent shares nearly 8% higher following the earnings results. We believe the primary reason behind the positive stock reaction was better-than-expected margin performance. That said, we still view shares, which currently trade 25% above our fair value estimate, as overvalued. Turning to the quarter, Fastenal's daily sales growth continues to decelerate. Revenue grew by a mid-single-digit rate in the third quarter compared with a high-single-digit rate in the beginning of 2023. Fastener sales were down by 2% year on year, while safety supplies and remaining products were up 9.2% and 6.8%, respectively. Recall, the company's fastener business is more cyclical, given its high exposure to OEM production. This customer segment makes up over 62% of fastener sales. Overall, we're still confident Fastenal can grow sales by more than 5% in 2023. The company continues to make progress with vending and on-site signings. The other takeaway from third-quarter earnings was the company's margin resilience. Operating margin held steady at 21%, thanks to effective price/cost management. Freight costs can continue to come down, helping protect profitability. Still, we forecast operating margins to decline 10 basis points to 20.7% in 2023 due to price normalization. Our demand outlook for Fastenal remains unchanged. Demand remains sluggish across most end markets, but the industrial distributor model allows for cash flow resiliency. Operating cash flow conversion was over 130% in the quarter, as slowing demand reduced working capital requirements. In addition, the company is holding less inventory on average (frees up cash), given supply chains are easing. This dynamic gives us comfort that Fastenal can still reinvest in the business, even if sluggish demand is around for longer. A key priority for the company is investing in on-sites and vending machines.","Vending and on-site programs should provide a long growth runway for Fastenal.  Fastenal can capitalize on its national scale, broad product portfolio, and inventory-management services to take market share from smaller and less capable distributors. Despite serving cyclical end markets, Fastenals business model generates strong free cash flow throughout the cycle. Fastenal is likely to continue to use its cash flow to fund a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.","Fastenal could continue to face gross margin headwinds as non-fastener sales, national accounts, and on-site programs become a larger part of its business. A continued mix shift toward non-fasteners could also dilute the firms differentiation. Amazon Business could disrupt the industrial distribution industry, taking market share and pressuring margins. Once a primary growth driver, store count has declined by over 20% since its 2013 peak as market saturation and e-commerce make new stores a less viable growth strategy.",12/10/2023,"Since opening its first fasteners store in 1967, Fastenal has built one of the largest industrial distribution businesses in the United States. For many years, Fastenals growth story was driven by its branch count, which now stands around 1,600. While this expansive footprint is still an important component of Fastenals business model, other strategies--including expanding its product portfolio, its vending and inventory management services, and, most recently, its on-site program--have become increasingly important growth drivers. The benefits of Fastenals vending, inventory management, and on-site services are twofold: Not only do these services drive incremental revenue, they also embed Fastenal in its customers procurement processes, which supports higher retention rates and pricing power. We believe Fastenal has a first-mover advantage in both vending and on-site services, introducing the former in 2008 and the latter in 1992 (although the on-site strategy did not become a focused strategy until the past few years), and we see long growth runways for both offerings. In addition to growth through its vending and on-site initiatives, Fastenal is well positioned to benefit from customer consolidation trends. In recent years, customers have been consolidating their maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO, spending with large distributors to leverage their purchasing power and increase operational efficiency. With its national scale, broad product portfolio, and inventory management services, we believe Fastenal can capitalize on this trend and take market share from smaller and less capable distributors. Because Fastenals sales mix is increasingly skewing more toward large national accounts, on-site programs, and more price-competitive MRO products, the companys gross margins are likely to come under pressure. However, the combination of higher sales volume and containment of selling, general, and administrative costs provides Fastenal the opportunity to realize strong operating leverage and expand operating margins. We forecast Fastenal's operating margin to reach 21% by our midcycle year.","We assign Fastenal a wide economic moat because we believe the firm's competitive positioning will allow it to generate excess returns over the next two decades. Our confidence is rooted in Fastenals ability to fend off competitive pressures from both new and existing players in the maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO, market. The North American industrial distribution market is highly fragmented with the largest players primarily benefiting from scale-driven cost advantages over smaller competitors that lack both scale and a global reach. As a large industrial distributor in North America, Fastenal benefits from volume-based rebates and other sales incentives that would be unavailable to smaller distributors. Furthermore, we believe Fastenal often receives preferential treatment from suppliers in the form of marketing support and product training, which, in turn, help Fastenal more cost-efficiently promote its product catalog and provide customer support.The companys efficient global sourcing and distribution network is another source of scale-driven cost advantages. The firm has approximately 1,600 branches and 14 distribution centers. Fastenal also utilizes its own fleet of trucks and delivery vehicles to cost-effectively move its inventory. We view the companys internal fleet capabilities as a key cost advantage over competitors. Fastenals scalable distribution network and centralized order fulfillment centers allow the company to cost-effectively serve its customer base, including multi-national customers that require consistent product availability and service quality around the globe. We believe Fastenals technological capabilities, including its e-commerce sales channel, integrated customer purchasing and supply chain solutions, and warehouse automation, drive distribution efficiencies that would be difficult for smaller competitors to replicate.In our view, Fastenal's cost advantages have allowed it to earn strong returns on invested capital historically (approximately 25% on average over the past two decades). Fastenal has carved out a niche within fasteners (34% of sales). Most of Fastenals business is focused on large enterprises (58% of sales) that possess complex procurement systems. We believe these customers value Fastenals ability to manage their large, complex accounts and provide supply chain solutions. Fastenals high-touch model sets it apart from both smaller industrial distributors and online players like Amazon Business, and its on-site platform separates it from other large distributors.While non-fastener products (a more competitive market) account for two-thirds of Fastenals sales, we believe the companys leadership position in fasteners and supply chain solutions increase its value proposition with large enterprises. This allows Fastenal to charge higher prices for its services. The company offers customers a wide variety of inventory management solutions, which places dedicated inventory and staffing within customer facilities. Today, Fastenal has installed over 100,000 industrial vending machines, up from 47,000 installed machines in 2014. The companys FMI sales account for 37% of consolidated sales. Its on-site program has also experienced strong growth, expanding from approximately 200 on-site locations in 2014 to over 1,600 on-site locations today. Fastenals inventory programs are supported by its branch model, which offers a quick and convenient method for customers to procure fasteners and other MRO products, while also reducing shipping costs. An increasing number of companies have been consolidating their spending with large national distributors. Vendor consolidation allows customers to simplify their procurement processes and leverage their buying power. Because Fastenal has national scale, a global reach, and a robust portfolio of products and inventory management services, the company is well positioned to capitalize on this trend and take share from smaller local and regional distributors that do not have the scale to profitably service these customers. Although national accounts can generate lower gross profit margins, they also generate much higher volumes, which Fastenal can leverage to improve operating margins. The Amazon Business threat to industrial distributors is less of a concern for us today than it was a few years ago. The company has certainly grown over the past decade but not at the expense of Fastenal. We do not expect Amazon to replicate Fastenals vending and on-site programs anytime soon. Furthermore, we believe it would be difficult for Amazon to upend Fastenals entrenched position in fasteners, given its strong relationships with original equipment manufacturers. Amazon Business primarily serves small businesses, while Fastenals high-touch model caters to the needs of large enterprises. Moreover, Fastenal provides its customers supply chain solutions, as opposed to Amazon Business, which primarily focuses on online order fulfillment. Additionally, Amazon Business has experienced strong growth in the MRO market without having to make significant incremental investments into building out a high-touch business. We believe Amazons strategy will be focused on growing its endless assortment businesses (selling MRO products online), rather than trying to compete with Fastenal in high-touch sales (vending machines and on-site programs) and fasteners. In our view, Fastenal does not have environmental, social, and governance risks that could result in material value destruction. The most significant ESG risk the firm faces is human capital risk--that is, the risk that Fastenal is unable to adequately recruit, train, and retain the talent needed to sell its products and services and manage its supply chain, which could lead to lost market share. While a tight labor market remains a challenge for many companies, including Fastenal, we think the firm has adequately managed this risk. We think human capital risk is a greater challenge for some of Fastenal's smaller competitors that have fewer resources to manage this risk. The company also has exposure to emission regulation through its internal fleet operations. We believe Fastenal will invest in next generation products to reduce the emissions of its trucks and delivery vehicles. Furthermore, we think Fastenal will have time to evolve its fleet, given new emission regulation will likely be introduced gradually over the next decade.","We assign Fastenal a Medium Uncertainty Rating. Since 1993, Fastenal has significantly grown its product portfolio beyond its core fastener offerings. Today, fasteners represent about 30%-35% of the companys sales. While we believe a broad product portfolio is an important component of Fastenals business strategy, we worry that a growing mix of lower-margin non-fastener sales could expose the firm to increased competition and dilute margins. We do not believe that Amazon Business or other Internet-based distributors will have a meaningful impact on Fastenals fasteners business; however, these competitors could certainly affect Fastenals MRO business. Although Fastenals vending, vendor-managed inventory, and on-site services are key differentiators that support the firms pricing power, these types of services may not be an insurmountable advantage over the long run.As national accounts and on-site relationships gain prominence, Fastenal could face gross margin pressure, but these accounts also provide an opportunity to gain market share and increase volume, which should drive better operating leverage and improved operating margins. Still, given the competitive environment, volume gains may not be enough to offset pricing concessions needed to win larger national contracts. In addition, end users could choose to not participate in Fastenals on-site program.Because a meaningful portion of Fastenals sales are generated from heavy manufacturing and construction, performance is no doubt affected by cyclical downturns. Still, free cash flow generation has been quite resilient even during periods of declining sales, and the firm has historically used little or no debt, so we think it will maintain its financial flexibility throughout the economic cycle.","We assign Fastenal an Exemplary capital allocation rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investment, and appropriate shareholder returns. Since 1996 (and through 2022), we calculate that the firm has allocated approximately $9.9 billion of shareholder capital to fund dividends (59% of that $9.9 billion), capital expenditures (28%), share repurchases (11%), and acquisitions (2%). We calculate that 92% of that $8.8 billion was funded with operating cash flow, while debt issuances and other sources of funding account for the rest. Fastenal's reinvestment in high-growth opportunitiesfor example, vending and on-site serviceshas bolstered the top line but also generates strong returns on invested capital. In our view, management's well-executed strategy has helped embed Fastenal in its customers procurement processes, which supports higher retention rates and pricing power. Fastenals capital expenditures/sales ratio has averaged over 3% over the past five years and is significantly higher than peers'. Fastenals expansive branch network, vending business, and captive trucking fleet explain the firms higher capital intensity relative to most peers. Still, Fastenal generates industry-leading ROICs. Given Fastenal's strong reinvestment record and our outlook for continued success, we assess the firm's investment strategy as exceptional.Given Fastenal's relatively conservative use of leverage and consistent free cash flow generation, we assess the firm as having a sound balance sheet.The company began paying a cash dividend in 1991 and has consistently increased its dividend since then. Share repurchases have historically been a less important component of Fastenals capital allocation strategy; however, the firm has periodically repurchased shares since 2005. Between 2005 and 2009, Fastenal spent $191 million to repurchase 6.1 million shares, and between 2013 and 2016, it spent $415 million to repurchase 10.1 million shares. The most significant buyback activity occurred in fiscal 2015, when management viewed Fastenal stock as undervalued and took on debt to repurchase 7.1 million shares for $293 million. We believe Fastenal's shareholder distribution policy is appropriate, given the solid and dependable free cash flow generation. Dan Florness has been CEO since 2016 and was CFO from 1996 until his promotion to CEO. Holden Lewis joined Fastenal in August 2016 as CFO. Before that, he was a sell-side analyst at FBR Capital Markets, Oppenheimer, and BB&T Securities. Lewis background is unique in that he covered Fastenal for many years before joining the firm.","Fastenal opened its first fastener store in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota. Since then, Fastenal has greatly expanded its footprint as well as its products and services. Today, Fastenal serves its 400,000 active customers through approximately 1,600 branches, over 1,700 on-site locations, and 14 distribution centers. Since 1993, the company has added other product categories, but fasteners remain its largest category at about 30%-35% of sales. Fastenal also offers customers supply-chain solutions, such as vending and vendor-managed inventory.","Fastenal has an outstanding debt balance of approximately $555 million. It is leveraged at only 0.2 times 2022 EBITDA, which is very conservative relative to the other industrial distributors we cover. Fastenals earnings provide substantial headroom to service debt obligations. During fiscal 2022, Fastenal incurred only about $14 million of interest expense and generated about $1.6 billion of EBITDA, which equates to an extremely comfortable interest coverage ratio.Even with its expansive store footprint and cyclical end markets, Fastenal has a proven ability to generate free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures) throughout the cycle. Indeed, it has generated positive free cash flow every year since 2003. Given its conservative balance sheet and consistent free cash flow generation, we believe Fastenals financial health is satisfactory.",FAST,Industrials,34764709888.0,NMS,2774375.0,USD,60.959999084472656,True,0,57.337294140988234,68.04939000199391,1
24/11/2023,Uber Reports a Strong Q4; Expecting Quarterly GAAP Profitability in 2023; Shares Undervalued,Uber Technologies Inc,UBER,4,07/11/2023,Ali Mogharabi,55.37,USD,23/11/2023,68.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,B,07/11/2023,"Demand for Ubers mobility and delivery remained high as indicated by third-quarter results, which showed GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter. While the numbers continue to display the firms network effect moat source, we were more impressed with Ubers ability to gain traction in more markets and increase adoption of more non-UberX products like Uber for Business, taxi platform, and shared rides, further driving growth. We are maintaining our $68 fair value estimate and still view the shares of narrow-moat Uber as attractive. Ubers gross bookings increased 21% year over year to $35.3 billion, led by an increase in mobility (31%) and delivery (18%), slightly offset by a decline in freight (down 27%). Total net revenue was up 11% to $9.3 billion, impacted by changes in business models in some markets that lowered take rates but had no impact on the bottom line. Without those changes, mobility and delivery net revenue would have grown impressively at 35% and 19% from last year, respectively. The Uber platforms flywheel continued to spin, shown by an increase in users (15%), orders (25%), order frequency (9%), and average gross booking per order (8%), accommodated by strong supply, as the number of drivers and couriers hit a record 6.5 million. Freight revenue declined 27% as demand in that market remains low. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion (3.1% margin) was up from last years $516 million (1.8% margin), helped by the top-line growth, including the high-margin advertising revenue. This, combined with the firms cost control and increased efficiency, drove margin expansion in mobility (up 60 basis points to 7.2%) and delivery (up 130 basis points to 2.6%). Sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenue was down for the third consecutive quarter as the network effect further reduced consumer acquisition costs. Uber also reduced its headcount by 1%, and management said it expects that to increase only slightly or to remain flat in 2024.","Ubers position in the autonomous vehicle race could equalize gross and net revenue, after no longer needing to pay drivers. Pressure to pay a minimum amount per trip to its contracted drivers could create a barrier to entry for smaller players, helping Uber in the long-run. Ubers aggregation of multimodal offerings will drive in-app stickiness, making Uber a one-stop shop for all transport needs.","The development of autonomous vehicles, and especially Googles Waymo, could eliminate the need for all existing ride-share platforms, driving Uber and Lyft out of business. Ride-sharing is still a relatively new industry, which leaves plenty of room for increasing regulations that could hurt the company. Ubers public perception has suffered in recent years because of data breaches and bad culture of sexual misconduct and internal racial discrimination issues.",09/02/2023,"Uber has become the largest on-demand ride-sharing provider in the world (outside of China). It has matched riders with drivers completing trips over billions of miles and, at the end of 2022, had 131 million customers using its ride-sharing or food delivery services at least once a month. In light of Uber's network effect between riders and drivers, as well as its accumulation of valuable user data, we believe the firm warrants a narrow moat rating.  Uber helps people get from point A to point B by taking ride requests and matching them with drivers available in the area. Uber generates gross booking revenue from this service (the firms mobility segment), which is equivalent to the total amount that riders pay. From that, Uber keeps what remains after the driver takes their share.  As the pandemic spurred growth in demand for delivery services, Ubers business is now more diversified. The delivery segment remains resilient despite the fading pandemic while the ridesharing business continues to rebound and grow impressively.  We believe Uber has 30% global market share of the ride-sharing market, which we expect will reach more than $550 billion in total (excluding China) by 2027. The firm faces stiff competition from players such as Lyft (mainly in the U.S.). While Uber no longer operates in China, it does compete with Didi in other regions around the world. Globally, the market remains fragmented, and Uber competes with many local ride-sharing platforms and taxis. But, we expect the firm to remain the leader in this market as its network effect grows.  The firms food delivery service, which now represents nearly 40% of total revenue compared with only 11% in 2019 before the pandemic, will continue to be one of the main revenue growth drivers. Both the mobility and delivery segments should benefit from cross-selling opportunities on the demand and supply sides of the platforms. Further utilization of Ubers overall on-demand platform for delivery services in other verticals can also help the firm progress toward profitability, in our view. ","In our view, Uber Technologies' core business, the ridesharing platform, benefits from network effects and valuable intangible assets in the form of user data. We think these maintainable competitive advantages will help Uber to become profitable and generate excess returns on invested capital. For this reason, we assign Uber a narrow moat rating.Uber's network effects benefit drivers and riders, creating a continuous virtuous cycle. As a first mover in this market, where requests for rides from anywhere could be made in real time via a simple-to-use mobile app, Uber began to attract riders mainly via word-of-mouth. Growth in demand and further word-of-mouth marketing attracted drivers, or, in other words, increased the supply of Uber vehicles. In turn, as the number of drivers has increased, the timeliness and reliability of the service has improved, driving the number of users, which in turn attracts more drivers, all of which indicates a network effect. Uber was able to accelerate this network effect by focusing on smaller areas, such as San Francisco, before expanding into more cities. Demand is driven not only by more users but also likely by more rides per user. Globally, Uber's monthly average platform consumers, or MAPC, and the number of trips provided support our network effect assumption. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, total MAPCs and trips, along with trips per MAPC have returned to solid growth rates. Plus, increasing supply is based on both more drivers and increasing capacity utilization of each driver and vehicle. Network effects, by definition, not only allow new network participants to benefit but also existing ones. Thus, the riders on the platform benefit as more drivers are added, and existing drivers benefit from more riders, making the driver's utilization even more efficient. While Uber has benefited nicely from network effects, we don't believe it benefits from customer switching costs. In our view, the ride-sharing industry lacks barriers to entry or exit for customers and drivers. Both customers and drivers can easily switch to Lyft or other competing platforms, while customers also have other transportation options like taxis and public transit. In general, just as firms with network effects benefit from the positive flywheel effect when a network expands, they also run the risk of a negative flywheel if customers, drivers, or both start to depart, especially when the network lacks meaningful switching costs. Networks in tech are strong when faring well but can unwind quickly (think MySpace).In early 2017, Uber faced much criticism for appearing to support an immigration order signed by President Donald Trump and attempting to profit from protests related to that event in New York City, both of which led to the #deleteUber campaign launched on Twitter and eventually tainted the Uber brand and reputation. Then CEO Kalanick was appointed to Trump's economic advisory council, to which some employees at Uber objected. The lack of exit barriers and switching costs for riders and drivers was on display during this period, as other ride-sharing providers, such as Lyft, made headway in New York City and experienced faster growth in trips as riders easily downloaded apps for other services. While we witnessed a slight pause in Uber's network effect in 2017, the firm's return to faster growth in trips provided supports our assumption that the platform still benefits from the network effect. In our view, Uber's ride-sharing network effect has also helped the firm tap into other markets and generate additional revenue streams. An example is the delivery market, in which Uber has gained traction with its Uber Eats service. According to data from Bloomberg Second Measure, Uber is now the number two player in the delivery business, below DoorDash, both of whom quickly displaced the former market leader, Grubhub. Regarding the network effect, the same can be said about Uber extending its reach into the bike-sharing and freight brokerage markets. Perhaps a good comparison for adjacent network effects, where one strong network enables a firm to expand elsewhere, is Microsoft: Its dominant network around Windows allowed it to leverage its strength into the productivity software market with Microsoft Office. Similarly, Uber's strength in ridesharing is leverageable elsewhere.As Uber benefits from its network effect, we think it gains access to valuable intangible assets in the form of user data, which we suspect helps the firm improve its services and increase its vehicles' capacity utilization. In turn, Uber's service may become more effective as it further monetizes its riders via real-time supply and demand-driven pricing. Uber may also use this extensive data and knowledge to tap into other markets as it has in advertising. Uber gathers data about riders and drivers. As the firm compiles data from the rider app about the location and timing of ride requests, Uber can get a clearer picture of its users' tendencies. When combined with the user-generated driver ratings, we think such information helps Uber improve the timeliness of matching riders with drivers. Such overall enhancement in service could help the firm strengthen its network effect by increasing users and ride requests per user, which helps Uber gather additional data, possibly further increasing the overall value of the data. Simply put, data can also be considered an indirect network effect moat source. Google's search engine is an example of the benefits of indirect network effects associated with data, as more searches have led to better algorithms, better results, and in turn, more searches. Similarly, more rides with Uber may lead to better algorithms and supply/demand balance, thus reducing wait times for riders and idle capacity for drivers, leading to more ride requests.","Uber faces intense competition in the U.S. from Lyft which has gained market share. In addition, it remains possible that Lyft out-innovates Uber to emerge as a winner-take-all (or most) ride sharing provider. Plus, there are certain concerns about whether Ubers network effect can remain an economic moat source if the firm is forced to incur additional costs imposed through regulations at the municipal, state, and/or federal levels. For example, Uber may be forced to conduct more thorough background checks on all driver applicants, such as adding costlier fingerprinting to the driver application process everywhere in the U.S., although the firm already conducts an annual background check on all its drivers. Such concern is also an ESG risk related to human capital as lack of enough background checks may put riders at risk and lessen the quality of the firms services. At the same time, more driver and rider data gathering may increase the data privacy and security ESG risk for the firm. Other regulatory issues may also serve to inhibit Ubers network effect benefits. Concerns include whether Uber will have to pay a minimum amount to each driver or courier per trip. While the firm may have to concede and implement such policies, it will also likely take an overall higher percentage from the gross revenue generated per ride, as its price is likely to remain competitive with Lyfts. Lack of enough compensation and/or benefits is also a human capital ESG risk, in our view, which can lead to drivers jumping to other platforms and reversing the firms network effect. We note that both dominating firms in the U.S., Uber and Lyft, are likely to demand higher take rates.There also lies the risk of larger technology companies such as Alphabets Waymo, or car companies such as General Motors Cruise, more aggressively pursuing the growing ride-sharing market.","We assess the capital allocation of Uber as Standard. While Uber is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, we view its balance sheet as sound with net debt of $4.3 billion. We expect the firm to continue to progress toward GAAP profitability, which we project will be in 2024. We foresee the firm generating over $2 billion in free cash flow in 2023.On the investment front, we view managements performance as fair. While as a first mover the firm aggressively launched ridesharing platforms in many markets around the world, various bumps on the road such as differences in cultures, laws, and their enforcements prevented the firm from grabbing the number one or two positions in those markets. However, we also applaud Ubers decision to sell those operations for equity stake in the market leaders such as Didi and Grab. The firm also sold its autonomous vehicle technology business to Aurora, in which with some additional investments, Uber now has a 25% stake. The firm has already begun to realize returns on some of those investments. For example, in 2021, Uber announced the sale of its equity stake in the two joint ventures to partner Yandex for around $2.8 billion in cash, which was above the $1 billion carrying value that Uber reported at the end of the second quarter 2021. Uber received $1 billion in 2021 for all its holding in an autonomous joint venture with Yandex, the Yandex Self-Driving Group, and for 4.5% of MLU, the joint venture that includes delivery and mobility platforms. The deal also included a two-year call option for Yandex to purchase the remainder of Ubers stake in MLU for between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. The firm has also made sound acquisitions of various platforms that we think will further enhance and expand its mobility and delivery business segments. They include the acquisitions of the ridesharing platform provider in the Middle East, Careem, plus delivery competitor Postmates, grocery delivery platform Cornershop, and logistics technology provider Transplace. Uber does not distribute dividends and currently does not have a share repurchase program. We applaud management as we believe the firm should continue to allocate capital toward innovation and growth. While Uber's legal issues under former CEO Travis Kalanick (who no longer owns any shares in Uber) gave it a tainted reputation (involving everything from data breaches swept under the rug to a culture of sexual misconduct and accusations of not addressing internal racial discrimination issues) the firm has seen better days under Dara Khosrowshahi, the firms current CEO. Khosrowshahi also has a seat on Ubers board of directors.After joining Uber in September 2017, Khosrowshahi launched successful campaigns that repaired the firms image. In addition, he completed an investment deal with Softbank, settled legal disputes with Waymo, and agreed to purchase the leading ridesharing service provider in the Middle East, Careem. Plus, he has led the firm to profitability on a non-GAAP basis and with positive free cash flow. Prior to Uber, Khosrowshahi was the CEO of Expedia for nearly 12 years. Prior to Expedia, he was also the CFO of IAC/InterActiveCorp. Khosrowshahi brought Nelson Chai onboard in September 2018 as Ubers CFO. Chais experience includes having served as the CEO of The Warranty Group, President and Chairman of CIT Bank NA, and CFO of NYSE Euronext and before that the NYSE Group.","Uber Technologies is a technology provider that matches riders with drivers, hungry people with restaurants and food delivery service providers, and shippers with carriers. The firm's on-demand technology platform could eventually be used for additional products and services, such as autonomous vehicles, delivery via drones, and Uber Elevate, which, as the firm refers to it, provides ""aerial ride-sharing."" Uber Technologies is headquartered in San Francisco and operates in over 63 countries with over 131 million users that order rides or food at least once a month. Approximately 44% of its gross revenue comes from ridesharing and 34% from food delivery.","At the end of 2022, Uber had nearly $5 billion of cash and $9.3 billion of debt on its balance sheet. Uber burned $2.7 billion and $445 million in cash from operations in 2020 and 2021, but generated $642 million in cash from operations during 2022. Capital expenditures averaged at less than $400 million during those three years. We expect the firm to continue to generate positive cash from operations in 2023 and beyond. By 2032, we estimate Ubers cash from operations could exceed $17 billion, outpacing top-line growth due to operating leverage. We expect Uber to also remain free cash flow-positive beyond 2022, averaging free cash flow to equity/revenue of nearly 10% through 2027. However, we do not foresee the firm issuing dividends. Uber will likely use any excess cash for further acquisitions.",UBER,Technology,118018269184.0,NYQ,26354656.0,USD,55.369998931884766,True,1,46.421411581596466,67.80283958529137,1
