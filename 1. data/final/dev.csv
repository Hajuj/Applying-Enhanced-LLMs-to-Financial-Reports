24/11/2023,Credit and Equity Market Headwinds Will Continue to Affect Flows and AUM Levels at CI Financial,CI Financial Corp,CIX,3,09/11/2023,Greggory Warren,13.79,CAD,23/11/2023,16.0,High,Narrow,Poor,C,09/11/2023,"There was little in narrow-moat CI Financial's third-quarter operating results that would alter our long-term view of the firm. We expect to leave our CAD 16 per share fair value estimate in place. CI Financial closed out the September quarter with CAD 119.0 billion in core assets under management, or AUM, down 2.7% sequentially but still up 4.2% year over year. Outflows of CAD 449 million were augmented by market losses of 2.9 billion. The company's core asset management segment accounted for 30% of total managed assets (of CAD 397.6 billion) and 41% of base management fees during the third quarter. As for the firm's Canadian wealth management segment, which accounted for 21% of managed assets and 23% of management fees, AUM decreased 1.3% sequentially but was up 10.2% year over year during the September quarter. And finally, CI Financial's U.S. wealth management segment, which accounted for 49% of managed assets and 36% of management fees, saw its managed assets increase 1.6% sequentially and 31.5% on a year-over-year basis (mostly due to acquisitions). Third-quarter total revenue for CI Financial increased 20.0% when compared with the prior year's period, as declining asset management fees (down 2.9% year over year) and adverse currency exchange were more than offset by increased wealth management fees in both its Canadian and U.S. operations. Year-to-date revenue was up 18.5% when compared with the prior year's period, which aligns with our forecast calling for double-digit top-line growth during 2023. As for profitability, the company's year-to-date operating margins (adjusted for restructuring and other charges) of 33.7% were up 300 basis points when compared with the same period in 2022, even as selling, general, and administrative fees have increased meaningfully year over year. CI Financial reported adjusted earnings per share of CAD 0.81, in line with the FactSet consensus as well as our own estimate of CAD 0.81 per share.","With CAD 119.0 billion in core AUM at the end of September 2023, CI Financial is the second-largest non-bank-affiliated provider of mutual funds in Canada, with the scale necessary, in our view, to be competitive. CI Financial offers a broad product set under the CI Global Asset Management banner, which includes the Cambridge, Sentry, Harbour, and CI Multi-Asset Management brands. CI Financial's pursuit of wealth management operations in both the U.S. and Canada should provide an offset to the shifting balance of power in the Canadian fund manufacturing market.","With significant amounts of operating and financial leverage, and its fortunes tied to the direction of the equity and credit markets, CI Financial would be negatively impacted by market dislocations. CI Financial's debt was cut to junk status S&P Global Ratings in early May 2023 after the company asked the ratings firm to stop rating its debt. Mutual fund management fees are being compressed by increased competition for shelf space from the Canadian banks and insurance companies, greater transparency on mutual fund pricing, and the rapid growth of ETFs.",09/11/2023,"While CI Financial's aggressive pursuit of wealth management operations in both the U.S. and Canada the past few years has provided the company with a way to offset the shifting balance of power in the Canadian fund market, the company funded most of this acquisition-driven growth with debt. This was the brainchild of CEO Kurt MacAlpine, who was hired in 2019 to take CI Financial in a new direction after years of pressure on its core fund manufacturing business from the growth of lower-cost investment products. Although revenue and adjusted earnings per share have risen the past several years, the high degree of leverage on the balance sheet has weighed on the company's share price (and even led a ratings agency to declare their debt junk in early May 2023). We had been willing to cut the company some slack, as it was in the process of selling off at least 20% of its U.S. wealth management business via an initial public offering, intending to use some of the proceeds to pay down its debt load, as well as assign some debt to the spun-off operations. Unfortunately, the market for realizations remains stalled and there seems to be not appetite at all for offerings with higher levels of debt attached to them. As a result, it was not too surprising to see the CI Financial sell a 20% minority stake in the U.S. wealth management operations to several different institutional investors for CAD 1.3 billion during the second quarter of 2023.  In our view, the company put itself in a bind by leveraging up so much and given their inability to exit part of their acquisition-driven portfolio for a price that would allow them to either pay off or transfer debt to the spun-off operations they were not necessarily negotiating from a position of strength. While the investors paid a hefty premium for the minority stake, there is plenty about the terms of their investment that remain obscure, which makes us believe CI Financial may have had to subordinate themselves relative to these investors when the time comes to take the U.S. wealth management operations public. This has taken some of the gloss off of the feel good reaction most investors had to the news of the outside investment.","We believe CI Financial has a narrow economic moat, derived from both switching costs and intangible assets. The company is the second-largest independent asset manager in the Canadian market, with a diverse product mix and proven track record of consistently generating solid investment performance and organic growth. CI Financial has also been aggressively expanding its wealth management footprint, acquiring registered investment advisors focused on high-net-worth clients in both the U.S. and Canada, which should help offset some of the competitive pressures in the Canadian fund market. With the Big 6 Canadian banks (which are one of the primary distribution channels for mutual funds) ramping up sales of their own fund offerings at lower prices than independent asset managers, and a potentially greater focus on fees and performance as fee-based accounts gain traction in the Canadian market, which could lead to a diversion of capital away from higher-fee charging actively managed funds into lower-cost passive products (index funds and ETFs) in the near to medium term, we expect there will be a limit on the company's ability to generate outsize returns.The publicly traded traditional asset managers we cover tend to have economic moats, with switching costs and intangible assets being the most durable sources of competitive advantage. While the switching costs might not be explicitly large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results by moving from one asset manager to another tend to keep many investors in funds for extended periods of time. As a result, money that flows into asset-management firms tends to stay thereborne out by an average annual redemption rate for long-term mutual funds of less than 20% historically in the Canadian market, which means that the average Canadian fund manufacturer's AUM will turn over every four to five years. Asset managers can improve on the switching-cost advantage inherent in their business with organizational attributes (such as depth and breadth of product mix and distribution channel concentration and geographic reach) and intangible assets (such as strong and respected brands and manager reputations that have been derived from successful and maintainable track records of investment performance), which should provide them with a degree of differentiation from their peers. Although the barriers to entry are not significant, the barriers to success are extremely high, as it takes time and skill to not only put together a long enough track record of investment performance to gather assets but to build the scale necessary to be competitive. As such, the larger, more established asset managers have an advantage over smaller players, especially in gaining cost-effective access to distribution. Firms that have shown an ability to gather and retain AUM during different market cycles have tended to produce more stable levels of profitability, with returns exceeding their cost of capital for longer periods of time. While the more broadly diversified asset managers are set up to hold on to assets in varying market conditions, firms with solid product sets across asset classes (with solid investment performance built on repeatable investment processes) and that charge reasonable fees have done a better job of gathering and retaining assets. Asset managers offering niche products with significantly higher switching costssuch as retirement accounts, funds with lockup periods, and tax-managed strategieshave also tended to hold on to assets longer than those with less-sticky asset mixes.CI Financial had CAD 119.0 billion in core assets under management, another CAD 278.5 billion in wealth management assets under advisement, and CAD 23.4 billion in assets under custody at the end of September 2023, providing it with the size and scale necessary, in our view, to be competitive. With 35% of its core managed assets invested in equity funds, 40% invested in balanced funds, 10% in fixed-income funds, and the remainder held in alternatives and money market funds, CI Financial has a fair amount of diversity in its mutual fund AUM. While the company garners most of its fund business from the Canadian market, it does have a small presence in Australia/New Zealand via an 80% equity stake in GSFM, with assets from this region accounting for 4% of its core AUM. CI Financial's key strength during much of the new millennium was its ability to consistently generate strong investment performance and solid organic growth. The firm's performance track record had historically provided CI Financial with top-shelf placement on a lot of distributors' platforms, allowing it to generate positive average annual organic AUM growth during much of the decade following the 2008-09 financial crisis, which was significantly better than peers IGM Financial (Mackenzie) and AGF Management, both of which were in net redemption mode. That said, the firm's fund management operations have come down to earth a bit the past five (10) years, generating negative 4.7% (negative 1.8%) average annual organic AUM growth during 2018-22 (2013-22). As such, CI Financial has aggressively pursued an expansion of its wealth management operations in both the U.S. and Canada, targeting registered investment advisors focusing on high-net-worth clients, with strong organic growth profiles and attractive margins, and having leaders and a culture that fits with the firm's existing wealth management units. CI Financial's historically better-than-average performance track record, despite generating positive organic AUM growth, was not all that impressive given the top-tier positioning of its funds when compared with U.S.-based firms with comparable performance profiles. This exemplifies to us the limitations of an evolving fund manufacturing and distribution system in Canada, where even firms as well-positioned as CI Financial have been with its top-tier performance track record have generated less robust flows due to the power held by financial advisors and the growing competitive threat from distributors. In the Canadian retail fund market, financial advisors (including advisors employed by banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and independent advisory shops) have control over more than 80% of the country's AUM, which basically means that most retail investors are working directly with advisors to gain access to mutual funds. As these advisors have traditionally relied on trailer feeswhich are pulled directly from mutual fundsfor upwards of two thirds of their annual compensation, it has not been too surprising to see very little penetration for low-cost index funds and ETFs (which tend not to pay trailer fees) and a lot of higher-fee-charging poorer-performing funds still available for purchase. For much of the past decade, the Big 6 banks (and some of the other distributors that have their own in-house fund management operations) have had the best of both worlds, offering up funds with lower management fees than those put forth by the independent asset managers, while still capturing trailer fees on their own products being sold through their branch and advisory networks. This explains why firms like CI Financial, even during their periods of top-tier performance, have not seen the kind of robust organic growth that should have accompanied their stellar fund performance.On the fee front, we see just one direction for active management feesand that is down. While many of the independent asset managers have already cut fees during the past five years, primarily in response to the banks using price as a tool for taking share from the independents (which is something that we expect to continue), we believe that regardless of reputation, product set and/or distribution network, fee pressures will continue for the entire industry. While CI Financial does have its own in-house Canadian distribution network, which should theoretically insulate part of its business from the shift in the balance of power, the firm garners just under a third of its total assets from this segment (which at the end of the day it is basically a break-even business for the firm). That said, CI Financial seems intent on bulking up both its domestic and U.S.-based wealth management operations, acquiring (or talking majority stakes) in more than a dozen firms since the start of 2020, which should provide an offset to the shifting balance of power in the Canadian fund market.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for CI Financial is High. We do not currently consider any of the firm's environmental, social, or governance issues to be material enough to affect our uncertainty rating or fair value estimate. We believe CI Financial faces two key risks: volatile asset prices and an intensifying competitive environment. A market shock would have a negative effect on the firm, which has a high degree of both operating and financial leverage, as lower asset prices, especially in equites, would result in substantially lower levels of AUM, revenue, and profitability. Management fees, which account for around 80% of annual revenue, are linked to average levels of AUM, with CI Financial's top-line results being pressured in both down and more volatile markets. With the Canadian banks, which handle the vast majority of fund distribution in Canada, putting a greater focus on fund manufacturing, share has been lost and management fees have been pressured. In addition to distributors turning into competitors, other fund providers are gaining traction in Canada, including some of the largest U.S. providers of index funds and exchange-traded fundsBlackRock and Vanguardwith the market for these products growing at an accelerated rate. Finally, persistent investment underperformance could result in substantial market share losses over time. We expect there will be an increased focus on historical fund performance in the Canadian market, with the worst performers losing the most share and having the hardest time justifying their management fees. That said, the company is at a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors, due to its low to medium exposure to risks inherent to the industry, as well as its own operations, offset by the firm's solid management of its material ESG issues.","Kurt MacAlpine has been CEO of CI Financial since September 2019. Before joining the firm, MacAlpine was head of global distribution for WisdomTree Asset Management, where he helped diversify and globalize that firm's business. William Holland, who had been CI Financial's chief executive for more than a decade before relinquishing the CEO role in 2010, serves as executive chairman, a position he has held since 1999. As executive chairman, Holland is focused on the firm's strategic direction and opportunities, while MacAlpine is responsible for the company's day-to-day operations.Our stewardship rating for CI Financial is Poor. This rating focuses on the three key areas we assess to determine management efficacybalance sheet health, investment efficacy, and shareholder distributions. Given that a firm's financial health directly affects its ability to invest in future growth opportunities, return cash to shareholders, or even remain a going concern, it is important to pay attention to its balance sheet strength. Asset managers have a high degree of revenue cyclicality and operating leverage (with results tending to be impacted by the vagaries of the equity and credit markets) and are generally asset-light. As such, they should not maintain more than low to moderate levels of financial leverage. CI Financial, in our view, has a slightly more leveraged balance sheet than we'd like to see from an asset manager, with CAD 176 million in cash and equivalents, CAD 37 million in investments, and CAD 3.3 billion in long-dated debt (on a principal basis) at the end of September 2023. The firm has historically maintained medium debt to total capital and debt to EBITDA levels but did see its debt to levels (by our calculations) exceed 5 times at the end of last year. We view moves by management earlier this year to sell a 20% stake in its heavily indebted U.S. wealth management operations for CAD 1.3 billion, which was used to pay down CAD 713 million of debt and the outstanding balance on its credit facility, as a good first step in improving their balance sheet. CI Financial's long-term strategy has been focused on broadening the company's product portfolio (such that it appeals to the needs of both investors and advisors), filling out the ranks of its investment management professionals (to ensure it can maintain a strong track-record of investment performance), and developing and improving relationships in the different distribution channels where it seeks to sell product. Management has not been shy about using acquisitions to achieve these goalshaving embarked on a multiyear effort to expand its wealth management offerings, acquiring a string of different registered investment advisors in the U.S. and Canada during 2020-22.The strategy is the brainchild of CEO Kurt MacAlpine, who was hired in 2019 to take CI Financial in a new direction after years of pressure on its core business from the growth of lower-cost investment products. The former McKinsey consultant and WisdomTree executive has also significantly restructured CI Financial's Canadian fund-management business, its largest division. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share have risen, but higher than average leverage for an asset manager has weighed on the company's share price.On the distribution front, CI Financial has historically been good about returning excess capital to shareholders as share repurchases and dividends. During the past five calendar years, the firm repurchased (on a net basis) CAD 2.0 billion of common stock and paid out CAD 0.9 billion as dividends. With CI Financial having to raise capital from outside investors to help pay down some of its bloated debt load, share repurchases and any sort of increase in the dividend seemed to be off the table. That said, the firm dedicated some of the CAD 1.3 billion it raised by selling a 20% stake in its U.S. wealth management operations to share repurchases, returning CAD 229 million to shareholders during the second quarter, and another CAD 145 million during the third quarter of 2023.","CI Financial is a diversified provider of wealth management products and services, primarily in the Canadian market. The company had CAD 119.0 billion in core assets under management, another CAD 278.5 billion in wealth management assets under advisement, and CAD 23.4 billion in assets under custody at the end of September 2023, making it one of the largest nonbank affiliated asset managers in Canada. The company operates its fund business through CI Global Asset Management, which offers a broad selection of investment funds. On the wealth management side, the company operates through CI Assante Wealth Management, Aligned Capital Partners, CI Private Wealth, as well as a large group of acquired U.S.-based advisors, providing financial advice primarily to high-net-worth clients.","CI Financial has a slightly more leveraged balance sheet than we'd like to see from an asset manager, with CAD 176 million in cash and equivalents, CAD 37 million in investments, and CAD 3.3 billion in long-dated debt (on a principal basis) at the end of September 2023. The company's credit facilities require CI Financial's funded debt/annualized EBITDA ratio remain below 4.75-to-1 (which by our calculations they surpassed during the past year). We have been willing to cut the company some slack, though, as it had been in the process of selling off at least 20% of its U.S. wealth management business via an initial public offering, with the company not only being able to use some of the proceeds to pay down its debt load but assign some of that debt to the spun-off operations.

Still more leveraged than we'd like to see, but an improvement over end of 2022 levels. Once the company's balance sheet is less leveraged, we expect the bulk of CI Financial's excess cash (after internal and external investments) to be returned to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases.",CIX.TO,Financial Services,2321314048.0,TOR,527116.0,CAD,13.729999542236328,True,1,15.088614316209522,15.425154895317075,1
24/11/2023,Delivery Hero's Strong Growth Potential Is Underpinned by Its MENA and APAC Exposure,Delivery Hero SE,DHER,5,14/11/2023,Ioannis Pontikis,31.3,EUR,23/11/2023,88.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,,14/11/2023,"Delivery Hero published a third-quarter trading update with gross merchandise value, or GMV, up 9% in constant currency (up 2% at current rates) and revenue up 16% in constant currency (up 9% at current rates), implying take rates of 23.2%. On a per-segment basis, Asia's GMV was flat, and revenue was up 3%, versus down 6% and down 4% in current rates, respectively. GMV in the Middle East and North Africa and Europe was up by double digits to 26% and 15%, respectively, and the Americas was mixed, with GMV up 11% but down 1% including hyperinflation accounting. Integrated verticals' GMV and revenue grew 31% and 29%, respectively, with the group reporting that the segment has achieved positive gross profit after store-related expenses in the third quarter (935 stores globally). Delivery Hero maintained guidance for fiscal 2023, with adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of GMV at more than 0.5% and over 1% of GMV in second-half 2023 as well as free cash flow breakeven during second-half 2023 (versus negative free cash flow of about EUR 500 million in the first half). As a reminder, free cash flow excludes stock-based compensation, which amounts to about 0.8% of GMV for Delivery Hero and should be perceived as a true cost of running the business. The company upgraded the GMV growth outlook to the upper end of the 5%-7% range while reiterating revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2023 at 15%. We don't expect to make changes to our EUR 88 fair value estimate for Delivery Hero. Shares trade in 5-star territory despite a 7% uplift in shares as of Nov. 14, which is the time of writing.","Delivery Hero is one of the fastest-growing food delivery platforms in the world, a prerequisite to create strong network effects. The q-commerce concept in the MENA and Asia-Pacific regions expands the addressable market and has the potential to significantly increase barriers to entry. The group exhibits dominant market positions in regions with significant growth potential (Gulf Cooperation Council countries and South Korea), where logistics operations have proved to be profitable.","Maintainable profitability of the groups exposure in certain regions (Americas, parts of Asia) and markets (q-commerce) is still a work in progress. Delivery Hero's focus on significantly investing in and expanding its logistics business at the expense of the marketplace model is highly margin-dilutive in the short to medium term, which renders the company reliant on market conditions to fund its aggressive growth plans. COVID-19 has been a tailwind for the logistics business, which is the strongest growth driver for the group, with excessive growth expected to normalize soon.",12/07/2022,"Delivery Hero is one of the fastest-growing food delivery operators in the world. Its exposed to regions with attractive long-term structural characteristics and is well positioned to benefit from the secular trend of digitization of food delivery orders, in our opinion. A combination of strong positions in concentrated markets, consistent and sticky cohort behavior, profitable delivery operations in the Middle East and North Africa, the Woowa acquisition in South Korea, and a significant and untapped addressable market underpins our investment thesis. We believe Delivery Heros business model is based on strong multisided platform network effects and exhibits moatworthy competitive advantages in Europe, MENA, and Asia, where the group operates a mix of own-delivery and marketplace platforms and holds strong market positions while it has already achieved profitability in some countries in own-delivery.  Delivery Hero differs from other delivery operators in that its own-delivery business predominantly operates in countries with favorable characteristics, such as high population and restaurant densities, low/flexible minimum wages, relatively high average order values, and high frequency of delivery orders. We see the groups exposure to these regions (Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, and Egypt) as contributing to the creation of competitive advantages. That said, given the companys clear strategic focus on expanding own-delivery operations across regions and its quick-commerce business (sub-1-hour deliveries), for which the achievement of underlying profitability industrywide is still a work in progress, we think an investment in Delivery Heros shares comes with high uncertainty. With people spending more time at home, the pandemic has been a tailwind for takeaway platforms as penetration and usage have spiked to unprecedented levels and have remained elevated even during periods with no lockdowns or restrictions--an early sign of a prolonged change in consumer behavior, in our opinion. We expect the company to be able to support strong double-digit top-line growth as penetration and frequency of orders evolve.","We believe Delivery Heros business model is based on strong multisided platform network effects and exhibits moatworthy competitive advantages in Europe, MENA, and Asia, where the group operates a mix of own-delivery and marketplace platforms and holds strong market positions; it has already achieved profitability in own-delivery (in some regions higher than that of marketplaces). We think the Americas segment does not show signs of competitive advantages yet, being still at the early stages of its development (6% of total revenue). Similarly, the groups promising quick-commerce, or q-commerce, offering (sub-1-hour delivery of small quantities of household goods) is in its infancy, with sustainable profitability still a big question. That said, we believe that both segments do not constitute a threat to the groups moat and thus we assign a narrow economic moat rating to Delivery Hero. Although online food delivery has existed since the early 2000s (Just Eat was founded in 2001 in Denmark, Takeaway founded in 2000 in the Netherlands, Grubhub in 2004 in the U.S.), online penetration of the delivery and takeaway market has been relatively low. The business models that prevailed over the years were marketplaces and integrated delivery operators (marketplace and delivery). Marketplaces are aggregators of restaurant listings (similar to online classifieds but for the takeaway industry) that serve as advertising partners (traffic generation) and make money through fees charged per transaction on the platform (take rate or commission, from midsingle digits to midteens percentage of GMV depending on the region). Delivery operators, on the other hand, started to emerge only recently (Uber Eats was launched in 2014, DoorDash and Deliveroo in 2013 in the U.S. and United Kingdom, respectively) in a competitive response to aggregators dominance and profitability in markets with still significant secular growth potential. The strategy these companies deployed was to offer (for an additional fee per transaction, typically 15% for listing plus 15% for delivery service) last-mile delivery services on behalf of restaurants that didnt have or were willing to outsource this more complex part of the process.Because the space is still fragmented, at its early stages of development, and extremely fluid with new well-funded privately owned entrants operating completely different business models/strategies to compete in markets characterized for their ""winner take most"" attributes, we developed a framework to help us navigate through the noise. Since the assessment of competitive advantages is forward-looking (as opposed to backward-looking assessments of profitability and returns), our framework seeks to identify the long-term underlying economics behind the main business models in the market and determine the moat drivers, if any, for the companies we cover. Our analysis is based on the theoretical framework of network effects and multisided platforms. In general, consumers prefer a platform with a wide variety of restaurants and relatively low transaction costs (both implicit and explicit), and restaurants prefer a platform with more orders/customers. Hence, its reasonable to assume that consumers prefer a platform with more restaurants to one with fewer. In addition, consumers do not get charged for using these platforms, but they do pay delivery fees and incur implicit costs when using more than one platform in the form of time and hassle (search costs). Therefore, consumers will look on a second platform before ordering only if the benefit they can extract (more choice in the form of new restaurants or lower delivery fees for the same restaurants) outweighs the implicit and explicit transaction costs (search costs or higher delivery fees). Following the same logic, if consumers find the benefit of searching on another platform to be relatively low (fewer restaurants listed, high overlap with first platform, or higher delivery fees), they will naturally choose to order from the platform with the broadest range of restaurants or lower transaction costs. From the restaurants' standpoint, since the objective is to maximize profits and incur both explicit and implicit costs when joining a platform, it is reasonable to assume that they will join a new platform only if expected incremental profits outweigh the initial joining fee (paying for the platforms terminal and online setup) and the implicit cost of dealing with more than two terminals (typically one for own-orders, one for main platform and one for the new platform). If the new platform offers just a subset of the consumers/orders available on the previous platform (fewer consumers/diners and high overlap), restaurants might decide to either join only one platform, the large one, that offers the maximum profits (so-called single-homing), or multihome on both platforms (but not single-home on the small platform). If fees charged per transaction (take rates or commissions) by the larger platform are higher than the corresponding fees charged by a smaller platform, the restaurant will decide to single-home on the smaller platform, if the smaller platforms take rates are low enough to make up for lower volume. However, charging significantly lower commission rates than the larger platform is not always a realistic financial strategy and does not seem to be an option for smaller platforms (for instance, Hungryhouse, a small platform in the U.K. that was acquired by Just Eat in 2018, in the context of the regulatory inquiry, said that it charged the same commission rates as Just Eat). On the contrary, if the new platform offers new customers, it might make sense for the restaurant to multihome. In this case, the extra profit that the restaurant can earn from participating in a new platform (multihoming) is composed of the profits earned from unique orders (new platforms unique customers) and potentially higher profits from shared customers (if the new platform charges lower take rates).Here, the degree of competitive intensity to the main platform by a smaller platform is a function of (1) the number of unique customers in the new platform, (2) the take rate differential between the two platforms, and (3) the likelihood of multihoming by ""shared"" customers. We believe that the larger the platform, the lower the number of unique customers for the new platform. In addition, unless the smaller platform has a strong funding source (subsidiary of a large multinational), it is unlikely that it can sustain operations by supporting high take-rate differentials against a larger platform. For instance, a platform that is more than 2-3 times smaller than the leader in a market has to offer money to restaurants to encourage them to list. Hence, the larger the size differential, the weaker the competitive intensity by smaller competitors. On top of that, food delivery platforms need to invest in marketing to acquire consumers. There are two main types of marketing: brand awareness, through TV ads and digital advertising, and money-off vouchers. Both are a significant cost for food delivery platforms (from 2% to more than 8% of GMV or 12% to more than 25% of revenue) with around 50% of that expense typically fixed, benefiting large platforms that have already reached scale.For integrated delivery operators, the platform includes a third side, riders, whose goal is to maximize their income per hour. This often conflicts with the platforms goal of minimizing the delivery cost per drop. Initially, integrated delivery companies offered a fixed hourly pay plus a pay per drop structure (in the U.K., Deliveroo and Uber Eats paid riders GBP 7 per hour plus GBP 1 per drop, for example). Over time, delivery companies have tried to switch into a variable pay structure to reduce losses in regions with lower densities/volume of orders. Barring any regulatory actions, we believe the variable pay scheme will prevail because of the supply sides strong bargaining power and high rider turnover (at a greater than 50% annual turnover, most riders will be paid under the new scheme). Since riders are contractors (freelancers) and not employees, they have the right to work for any food delivery company, even at the same time (riders can reject orders they dont find worthwhile from one platform and accept more profitable orders from another platform). Our research suggests that riders can realistically sign up on a maximum of two platforms (multihome on the two largest available in their region) and are willing to use them at the same time to maximize income per hour. Here, too, network effects favor the largest platforms, with smaller firms having to pay higher fees to lure riders to make up for the lower number of orders.The implications of these observations are fourfold:1. If two platforms exhibit significant restaurant overlap, it is natural to expect that only one will survive in the long term. Conversely, if two platforms offer completely different restaurant listings, consumers would not think them as substitutes, and both platforms are likely to survive (platform and integrated delivery operators in mixed markets, for example). 2. Platforms that entered a market as first movers are more likely to have an advantage over new entrants. 3. The more time a platform operates without competition, the stronger the first-mover advantage becomes as a result of the positive indirect network effects (more restaurants, more orders, more riders, more consumers, more orders). However, the network effects flywheel can work in the opposite direction, too, in the growth phase of the industry (online penetration increases), so platforms should focus on expanding their networks and not run the business for profit maximization, which could slow the platforms growth and open up opportunities for new entrants. 4. New entrants should find it increasingly difficult to penetrate a market with a limited number of unique restaurants available and likely decide to exit if/when the incumbent platform reaches a critical mass, essentially leading to local monopolies (incumbent wins). Hence, there is only one option for food delivery operators that are new entrants in markets dominated by a marketplace player: Expand the available takeaway restaurant stock. This can be accomplished by onboarding restaurants that do not traditionally offer takeaway (full-service restaurants or limited-service restaurants without delivery capabilities) or by creating new restaurant concepts (ghost and virtual kitchens), expanding the supply of restaurants (such as the ones pioneered by Deliveroo).Our framework assesses competitive advantages using a decision tree with four questions:1. Is the regional market in which the company operates marketplace-driven or delivery-driven? 2. Does the company source most of its business from the marketplace or its own-delivery orders? 3. What is the strength of the companys market position (strong, competitive, weak)? 4. Is the market structure favorable or not (for integrated delivery operators only)?Marketplace companies with a strong market position, operating in a takeaway-driven market, exhibit strong competitive advantages in the form of network effects, switching costs and cost advantages reflected in consistently high EBITDA margins over the years. We think this is the result of:1. The powerful reinforcing effects of multisided platforms and networks (explained within our framework)2. Significant added value offered for captive restaurants as well as habitual behavior by diners despite both being free to use multiple platforms.3. Marketplaces lower break-even point than new entrants in these markets, which means that market share gains for new competitors come with significant losses. More specifically:Network effects: Diners seek the broadest range of restaurants, while restaurants seek the widest audience of diners. Marketplaces (or aggregators) have been the first movers in the emerging online takeaway market (more than 15 years for aggregators versus less than seven years for integrated delivery operators) versus about seven years for own-delivery peers. This gave them a significant advantage in capturing early on profitable orders predominantly coming from restaurants with their own delivery capabilities. In turn, this was made possible because at the time the big chains (predominantly pizza chains) were the only ones offering online ordering (through websites and mobile apps), leaving most local small takeaway restaurants at a disadvantage (phone orders only). Aggregators acted as online enablers and marketing partners, removing frictions, increasing efficiencies, and empowering small restaurants to manager their online promotions and placements on the platform. The ease of onboarding (lack of startup costs), intense competition by online-advantaged chains and transparent value preposition (high returns on invested capital based on fees per order) were structural drivers behind the participation of those restaurants in these platforms. Although the reinforcement of network effects could be characterized as less robust than the ones in other industries or platforms (social networks, Amazons marketplace, for example), we believe the ultralocal element of restaurant aggregators networks is equally moatworthy, as it presents high barriers to entry (depth and breadth of content is unmatched at a local level) and frequently leads to local monopolies.Switching costs: In the context of food delivery, we think switching costs are a competitive advantage despite restaurants and diners being free to use different platforms. First, there is evidence that consumers rarely switch food delivery platforms. In addition, ""active"" customers tend to value the ease of ordering, quality of previous experience, and having an account/app. We think this benefits incumbents (Uber Eats benefits, as well, as its likely that consumers already have an Uber account) because it is harder for new entrants to entice these customers to switch platforms (inertia). Our research suggests that customers may also face explicit costs in switching platforms in the form of higher delivery fees for similar type of restaurants. We think marketplaces will always have a structural advantage in that respect, as restaurants that deliver themselves are typically family owned, with members of the family often taking care of delivery, reducing the cost structure considerably versus delivery costs for integrated delivery operators and passing on the benefit to customers. For large quick-service chains (McDonalds, Burger King, KFC), we think marketplaces also have an advantage, as they can use their large profit pools to subsidize QSR orders to keep their profitable customers/orders on the platform.For restaurants, the platforms added value could be significant, especially for smaller takeaway restaurants with long tenures on the platform. For instance, the average Just Eat Takeaway restaurant in the Netherlands generates EUR 100,000 of additional revenue through Thuisbezordg.nl. This constitutes about 30% of the average restaurants revenue, according to Just Eat, which if lost could have a significant impact on margins. Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests multihoming between marketplaces is much more prevalent than between a marketplace and an own-delivery operator (such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo). This is important, as based on our framework, once a marketplace has gained critical mass, integrated delivery operators are more likely to survive in the same market than other smaller platforms (due to unique restaurant stock). In fact, most marketplace restaurants (54%) choose not to multihome, as the costs outweigh the benefits of reaching additional consumers. The reasons they gave for single-homing were to keep costs down (22% of restaurants); it was difficult to manage more than one platform (16%); and they already had enough orders/customers (15%). We think another reason marketplace restaurants may choose not to use more than one platform is because some of those high-quality restaurants with positive/numerous reviews have already built a brand on a platform, which could be very costly to re-create on another (through promotional activities, for example). We also think that marketplace restaurant switching costs act as a strong barrier to entry for new entrants (including own-delivery operators), as orders generated from these restaurants are typically the most profitable.Cost advantages: We think cost advantages as a source of competitive advantages is supported by the marketplaces ability to invest in lower restaurant fees and delivery fees (if needed to protect the platform), as well as invest more aggressively in marketing (50% being fixed). For reference, Deliveroos marketing expenses in fiscal 2018 (latest available) was GBP 200 million, or about 42% of its revenue versus Just Eat Takeaways roughly 27% of revenue (fiscal 2019). The delivery fee differentials we discussed above in combination with strong profitability for marketplaces versus loss-making operations for own-delivery players is another reflection of cost advantages, in our opinion.Conversely, we think that integrated delivery operators (companies that source a big chunk of their total orders from own-delivery) exhibit a less certain path toward excess returns and profitability, as the realities of the last-mile delivery economics are tough to overcome (mostly variable costs, delivery of warm dishes in 30 minutes on average from the time an order is ready to picked up by the rider). Although, there is evidence that last-mile delivery in developed markets could be profitable with our analysis of last-mile delivery economics at maturity corroborating this, the dynamic and fluid nature of the sectors structure makes us skeptical about the endurance of a moat underlying these business models. A secondary but equally important concern is regulatory risks around gig economy workers (riders), which raise questions about the profitability of last-mile delivery under a scenario of a fully employed model. That said, our analysis suggests that reasonable returns and profitability for delivery-led operators can only be achieved in markets with certain favorable structural characteristics, namely high population and restaurant density, dominant market positions, marketplace profit support, low minimum wages, high average order values, and high frequency of delivery orders.Given that Delivery Hero predominantly operates in countries with favorable structural characteristics, we see the groups exposure in these regions (Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, South Korea, and Egypt) as contributing to the creation of competitive advantages.Although network effects can still be powerful regardless of the business model (that is own-delivery or aggregator), the moatworthiness of these effects for integrated delivery operators relies on the characteristics of the market structure, in our opinion. For instance, delivery-driven businesses that operate in developing markets (low-wage markets with similar take rates and delivery fees, or markets with high population and restaurant densities) might find it easier to achieve the necessary returns and profitability and thus exhibit competitive advantages (Delivery Hero in MENA is already profitable). These cost advantages are reflected in delivery densities with operators with denser and more efficient networks of diners, restaurants and riders being in a better position to leverage last-mile delivery fixed costs. For these businesses, we see intangible assets as a more appropriate moat source than switching costs, emanating from the intellectual property of internally developed systems that manage pricing (delivery fee as an incentive for riders and barrier to entry for diners), matching (orders with riders, diners with restaurants), and logistics (routing software), all critical factors for the creation of a successful platform (frictionless experience for all sides of the platform).Based on our framework, Delivery Hero exhibits a narrow economic moat in Europe and MENA, where it operates a combination of own-delivery and marketplace business models with strong positions in many of these markets. Our analysis suggests that both could reach EBITDA margins about 25%-30% at maturity, with the more mature markets within these segments already achieving 20%-plus EBITDA margins (Yemeksepeti in Turkey, Nordics, Talabat) and some of the MENA markets achieving higher profitability in own-delivery versus marketplace (Saudi Arabia).More importantly, we see the groups exposure in South Korea as equally moatworthy, especially so after the recent confirmation by the regulatory authorities in South Korea of Delivery Hero's proposed merger with Woowa Brothers through the creation of a joint venture and an eventual 100% ownership. Delivery Hero proposed to acquire Woowa in December 2019, a deal that was recently approved by the Korea Fair Trade Commission conditional on the divestment of Delivery Heros subsidiary, Yogiyo. This should lead to Delivery Hero holding more than 50% of the Korean mobile app delivery market with Woowa Brothers. Woowa is predominantly a marketplace, with EBITDA margins as of 2018 at 19%. This is despite charging an average of 6.4% commission rates (implied by revenue/GMV reported in fiscal 2018 versus 15% for more mature markets). Despite the Korean market being delivery driven, with a much larger number of full-service restaurant establishments than limited-service available (395,000 versus 112,000 in 2019, according to Euromonitor), the markets duopoly structure and high restaurant and population densities, a dominant market position (Delivery Hero controls the majority of this market), and a culture of delivery drive our narrow moat assignment for the segment. The Asia business (of which more than 55% of revenue is Woowa) is a collection of markets that are in different stages of development and with a very strong growth profile. Although Delivery Hero does not disclose a breakdown, we know from its IPO prospectus in 2017 that three countries (Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia), where the group operates through Foodpanda, are highly profitable own-delivery operations. In addition, given that the South Korea division is also profitable and accounts for more than 55% of the Asia segment (Woowa, excluding Yogiyo) in our estimates and Woowas profitability was already close to 20% at the EBITDA level (as of fiscal 2018, albeit still at an early growth stage), we believe that a handful of markets in the segment where the group is still at the very early stages of development are responsible for the majority of reported losses (for example, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Myanmar, Philippines, and Cambodia).","We assign a very high uncertainty rating to Delivery Hero, the result of lower visibility on profitability path with regard to Glovo and Integrated Verticals, and funding constraints given still loss-making operations during a period with tightening market conditions, which could result in new rounds of equity issuance and/or suboptimal (in terms of timing and price) divestments of minority stakes when valuations are at their lowest. This is a function of still-high uncertainty around the viability and profitability of own-delivery operations. Delivery Heros strategy calls for aggressive expansion of logistics networks and last-mile delivery across multiple verticals, the profitability of which is still a work in progress. That said, the companys delivery operations in certain markets (MENA) have been profitable, the result of favorable structural characteristics (density, delivery culture, low wages/flexible work, high delivery fees). Increased investments in logistics infrastructure and higher customer acquisition costs (marketing and promotional activities have subsided due to COVID-19 only temporarily) industrywide, driven by a group of well-funded competitors like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Coupang, and new entrants (Getir, Gorillas and Flink among others) could have a material impact on profitability in the medium term, increasing variances in our modelling. However, we think Delivery Heros strong local market positions in the majority of regions where it operates as well as a hybrid business model add to the groups staying power longer term. From an environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, perspective, we think the social part of the acronym is more relevant for food delivery companies. We see riders' employment rights being top of mind for investors in the segment, with Delivery Hero scoring somewhere in the middle due to a variety of employment models it operates across regions (including but not limited to the gig economy worker model).","We assign Delivery Hero a Standard capital allocation rating. The group has generally been quite acquisitive in recent years, completing several EUR 100 million-plus deals since 2015. Although management has been quite successful in expanding the companys presence through acquisitions at reasonable multiples, it has not been as good an operator in some of the markets it eventually chose to exit. A striking example is Germany, where Delivery Hero was the dominant food delivery company for years until Takeaways entrance (through Lieferando). After years of fierce competition, Takeaway emerged as the winner with stronger growth, and Delivery Hero sold its German assets to Takeaway in 2018. Delivery Hero has also made sizable divestments in other markets/regions where it deemed it impossible to win over larger competitors (Canada, France, Netherlands, France, Italy, and Australia), a common business decision for smaller local players, given the industrys winner-take-most attributes. Delivery Heros expansion strategy is to enter underpenetrated markets/regions through acquisitions and invest aggressively to gain the first-mover advantage. The company has been able to gain access in several countries in Asia-Pacific through its acquisition of Foodpanda in 2016 and more recently Woowa Brothers (Vietnam, South Korea). In Latin America, Delivery Hero recently bolstered its presence with the acquisition of Glovos regional operations (in-market consolidation in Argentina, Panama, and the Dominican Republic). In MENA, one of the groups strongest and most promising regions, Delivery Hero has gained access through the acquisitions of Yemeksepeti in 2015 (Turkey), Talabat (2015), Foodpanda (2016), Carriage (2017), and Zomatos UAE business (2019). More recently, Delivery Hero acquired InstaShop, an online grocery marketplace in MENA operating in the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, and Lebanon, strengthening the groups quick-commerce business in a region with attractive last-mile logistic economics. Delivery Heros acquisition strategy has been largely executed at reasonable prices. Some of Delivery Heros most sizable acquisitions, such as Glovos Latin America business (0.7 times gross merchandise volume), InstaShop (about 1 times GMV), Foodpanda (about 8 times revenue), and Woowa (0.6 times GMV and 9 times revenue at the time of the deal's announcement), have been completed at reasonable multiples in line with precedent transactions in the sector (averaging 1.6 times GMV and 9.4 times revenue). On Dec. 31, 2021, the company announced that it agreed to acquire about 39.4% of the shares (on a nondiluted basis) in Glovo, a European multicategory delivery app, on top of the 43.8% it currently holds. Delivery Hero will complete the transaction by issuing new shares, valuing Glovo at EUR 2.3 billion on a fully diluted, cash-free, and debt-free basis or about 0.77 times EV/gross transaction value (on EUR 3 billion run-rate GTV), which is lower than precedent transactions but in line with most recent deflated valuations in the space. Although Glovo's footprint is predominantly complementary to Delivery Hero's, the company derives about 60% of its GTV from Spain (close number one, about 30% of GTV in our estimates), Italy (number 2), Portugal (number 2), and Poland (number 2), where the food delivery market is competitive and labour market rules less friendly to the freelance model (especially Spain and Italy). The remaining footprint is in emerging early-stage markets in Southeast Asia (24%) and the Commonwealth of Independent States and Africa (15%), where the company sports number-one market positions. Glovo is predominantly a logistics-focused player with more than 90% own-delivery orders.","Delivery Hero is an online food delivery provider and active delivery service headquartered in Germany. It operates in 49 countries across five continents. Commission rate per order, the companys largest source of revenue, varies across the countries in its four geographic segments--the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa--as well as the type of restaurant and the provided service.","Delivery Hero is in good financial health. Despite the groups acquisitive nature, recent large transactions have been financed through a combination of equity and hybrid debt, leaving the balance sheet with an ample amount of cash. Even after the acquisition of Woowa Brothers (first quarter of 2021), Delivery Hero will have more than EUR 2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Given the tightening fund raising environment and still an aggreassive expansion plan in place (Dmarts), the company has recently raised about EUR 2.3 billion in debt (out of a total around EUR 4.5 billion) including around EUR 1 billion in term loans (with the residual EUR 1.25 billion from convertible bonds). Despite the positive outlook, however, Delivery Hero is still burning cash, and we expect it to continue doing so until fiscal 2024. This exposes the company to exogenous market conditions, which could limit or slow its expansion plans in case of a risk-off event or even worse force it to raise equity capital at highly depressed equity market values. The company has more than EUR 550 million balance sheet optionality from liquid investments in public companies (such as Deliveroo, Just Eat, among others).",DHER.DE,Consumer Cyclical,8063414272.0,GER,215174.0,EUR,31.084999084472656,True,1,31.16850574537702,24.59028910441807,0
24/11/2023,CF Industries Low-Cost Nitrogen Production Should Remain Profitable as Prices Stabilize,CF Industries Holdings Inc,CF,3,02/11/2023,Seth Goldstein,76.41,USD,23/11/2023,85.0,High,,Standard,B,02/11/2023,"CF Industries' third-quarter results reflected lower nitrogen prices, where spot prices generally bottomed out near the beginning of the quarter, before slightly rising during the quarter. However, we had expected the lower results given our forecast for lower nitrogen prices. With our near- and long-term nitrogen price forecast unchanged, we maintain our $85 per share fair value estimate for CF Industries. Our no-moat rating is also unchanged. CF shares were up slightly at the time of writing. The stock trades a little below our fair value estimate but in 3-star territory. Accordingly, we recommend investors wait for a pullback and for shares to offer a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point into the pure-play nitrogen producer. With prices currently just above our long-term urea forecast of $350 per metric ton, we forecast prices will normalize. However, given our view U.S. natural gas prices to rise in 2024, we expect CF will see lower profits in 2024. However, should natural gas prices rise around the world, particularly Europe, where nitrogen producers represent the marginal cost of production, we see the potential for nitrogen prices to rise in 2024. However, offsetting this favorable dynamic for CF's realized nitrogen prices is potentially lower U.S. demand. Soybean prices are currently at a favorable level relative to corn prices. If this dynamic holds through the winter, we would expect more U.S. soybean acres and fewer corn versus 2022. Given that soybeans require far less nitrogen versus corn, a shift to soy acres could weigh on U.S. nitrogen demand in 2024.","High shipping and storage costs for importers of nitrogen fertilizer limit the competition CF faces in North American markets from outside regions with low natural gas costs. Using low-cost U.S. natural gas as a feedstock, CF's nitrogen operations currently sit at the low end of the global nitrogen cost curve. CF's investments in blue and green ammonia will create value for shareholders as demand for these premium-priced products grows.","Soybeans, which do not require nitrogen fertilizer, have seen a growing share of planted acres in North America, hurting nitrogen fertilizer demand. In nitrogen, CF competes with many companies that are state-owned or government-subsidized. Government-controlled firms are more likely to produce quantities in excess of demand, disrupting supply/demand balances. CF's investments in blue and green ammonia will destroy value for shareholders if demand for these products fails to materialize.",02/11/2023,"CF Industries is the largest nitrogen producer in North America, with production based in the United States and Canada. CF's plants, which benefit from low-cost North American natural gas, are connected to its main customers in the U.S. Corn Belt by an extensive distribution network of pipelines, rail, and barge, giving the company a transportation cost advantage over foreign competition without pipeline access. With roughly 80% of nitrogen sold as fertilizer, CF's sales and profits are largely tied to U.S. corn planted acreage. Nitrogen fertilizers are key to achieving higher yields in corn, as the crop, unlike soybeans, does not produce its own nitrogen. As a result, U.S. corn-planted acres are a big driver of North American nitrogen demand. CF's largest plants are its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and Port Neal, Iowa, locations. The company has the flexibility to shift production to the various nitrogen fertilizers, which allows it to produce based on market demand in any given year while retaining additional capacity to produce higher-margin industrial products. Donaldsonvilles seaborne location also allows CF to export fertilizer products and take advantage of nitrogen demand in South America, a region that heavily imports nitrogen fertilizer. On the cost side, natural gas is the main feedstock used in nitrogen fertilizer production, accounting for nearly 50% of production costs. Lower North American natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world have made CF and other North American producers more competitive compared with overseas rivals, which rely on higher-cost natural gas or coal-based feedstock. Urea is the general benchmark for all nitrogen fertilizers. Urea prices generally fall in line with marginal cost producers who currently use European natural gas-based feedstock. CF is also investing in carbon-free (blue and green) ammonia, which should see increased demand as a substitution for hydrogen fuel or as a cost-effective way to transport hydrogen. The company plans to produce this at existing plans and through the buildout of a new plant. This represents an incremental demand source at a premium price as ammonia would be used as a low-carbon fuel.","We don't think CF Industries has an economic moat. When looking at the companys cost position in isolation, we would likely award CF an economic moat, as the firm has a cost advantage over its global competitors. CF and other North American nitrogen producers currently sit at the low end of the global ammonia cost curve, as they benefit from low-cost natural gas inputs. As one of the largest nitrogen fertilizer producers in the world, CF possesses substantial scale, but the major factor that determines relative cost advantage in the nitrogen industry is the price a firm pays for natural gas (or coal in many China plants) to produce ammonia and urea.The companys capacity expansions at its Louisiana and Iowa plants came with a steep price tag of $5.2 billion, which has significantly increased the firms capital base. We think CFS capacity expansions are unlikely to generate an economic profit, given our outlook that nitrogen fertilizer prices will remain closer to the current price of around $260 per metric ton (in 2020 real terms) compared with prices around $400 in 2012, when CF began the expansion projects. Further, with Chinese producers replacing old coal plants with natural gas and more efficient coal plants, the cost curve has flattened in recent years. As a result of the inflated capital base against the backdrop of lower nitrogen prices, we do not have confidence that CF will be able to outearn its cost of capital over the next 10 years, even as most of the company's assets sit near the bottom of the global cost curve.","We rate CF with a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.CF's largest risks are nitrogen prices and U.S. natural gas costs, both of which are subject to volatility. CF is also exposed to the spread between U.S. natural gas and either Chinese anthracite coal or European natural gas. CF produces nitrogen primarily from U.S. natural gas, while higher-cost producers in China use anthracite coal or in Europe use natural gas. Should the price spread between anthracite coal, European natural gas, and U.S. natural gas converge, global nitrogen prices would likely follow, eroding CF's margins.U.S. nitrogen prices are also affected by exporting producers in the Middle East and China. Excess production can lead to an oversupplied market and weigh on prices. Factors affecting the price of fertilizers include weather and farmer planting decisions. CF's profits are linked to the prices of corn and soybeans. Many of the company's customers in the Midwestern U.S. choose to plant either corn or soybeans, based on expected net return. Higher soybean prices relative to corn can hurt nitrogen fertilizer demand and subsequently CF's cash flows, as soybeans derive nitrogen naturally and require substantially less nitrogen fertilizer.Along these lines, genetically modified crops pose a potential threat to nitrogen demand. If the trait in soybeans that allows the crop to naturally derive most of its nitrogen is transplanted into corn and other crops that require nitrogen fertilizer, this could substantially reduce nitrogen demand. Nitrogen prices would likely plummet as a result, flattening the cost curve as higher-cost supply goes off line.CF's largest ESG risks come from potential regulation of the company's carbon and other emissions, effluents, and waste. We view potential new regulation as having a moderate probability of occurring. We see a low materiality impact, as CF has a plan to reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of more-renewable energy in its nitrogen operations.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to CF Industries based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We rate the balance sheet as sound. CF's revenue is subject to high cyclicality. However, with a strong balance sheet and manageable near-term debt maturities over the next few years, CF is not in danger of being unable to meet its financial obligations.We view management's investments as fair. We are in favor of CF's plan to invest in blue and green ammonia as these incremental sources of demand are likely to help CF grow long-term profits. We view the Waggaman ammonia facility acquisition as value neutral, as we think CF will pay a fair price for the deal. We also think CF does a good job in its execution, as highlighted by the company being able to increase its product volume sales in 2019, amid flooded fields and the lowest U.S. acres planted in over a decade.However, we think management's strategy has failed to generate an economic return over a full cycle. The purchase of Terra looked like a good investment when nitrogen fertilizer prices were high during the first few years after the acquisition. Against a backdrop of high corn prices and low North American natural gas costs following the purchase in 2010, Terra's nitrogen fertilizer assets generated healthy returns. Additionally, the company's large capacity expansions for its nitrogen complexes in Louisiana and Iowa came at an estimated cost of $5.2 billion. With urea prices at or above $400 per metric ton, the investments made sense at the time, however, this is well above our long-term price forecast.We see shareholder distributions as appropriate. The dividend is stable, and management has historically made major share repurchases when CF's stock price has traded below our fair value estimate, which we view as an excellent use of capital. In recent years, CF used excess cash flow to reduce debt on its balance sheet. As a result, CF should be able to maintain the dividend even when nitrogen prices are at cyclically low levels.Tony Will became CEO in 2014. He was previously the vice president of manufacturing and distribution, having joined CF in 2007 with a background in management consulting. Managements short-term compensation looks at an annual EBITDA target and ammonia production volumes, while long-term compensation, which is the majority of managements total pay, is based on enterprise value creation and employee retention. We would prefer managements long-term compensation use more-specific measurements such as return on invested capital.","CF Industries is a leading producer and distributor of nitrogen fertilizers. The company operates seven nitrogen facilities in North America and holds joint venture interests in further production capacity in the United Kingdom and Trinidad and Tobago. CF makes nitrogen primarily using low-cost U.S. natural gas as its feedstock, making CF one of the lowest-cost nitrogen producers globally. The company is also investing in carbon-free blue and green ammonia, which can be used an alternative fuel to hydrogen or as a means to transport hydrogen.","CF Industries is in excellent financial health as cash exceeded debt as of Sept. 30. It had a little under $3 billion of total debt and over $3.25 billion in cash.CF plans to acquire an ammonia facility for $1.25 billion in a deal that should close in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result, we expect CF will end the year with debt exceeding cash, but the company's balance sheet should remain strong.The company also plans to build a greenfield clean ammonia plant in a joint venture with Mitsui that will cost roughly $2 billion. CF will own 52% of the project, which will take five or so years to build, requiring a little over $200 million a year of additional capital expenditures for CF. Given the company's strong financial position, it should have no problem funding the project. Management's long-term goal is a 2.5 times leverage ratio. We expect CF to maintain a healthy financial position over the long term, with enough cash flow to maintain its $1.60 annual dividend and fund share repurchases.",CF,Basic Materials,14579482624.0,NYQ,3364009.0,USD,76.41000366210938,True,1,79.90176454431295,78.3666113394321,1
24/11/2023,Pentair's Transformation Initiatives Continue to Drive Impressive Margin Expansion,Pentair PLC,PNR,4,25/10/2023,Krzysztof Smalec,63.22,USD,24/11/2023,70.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,25/10/2023,"We are maintaining our $70 fair value estimate for narrow-moat-rated Pentair after the company reported third-quarter results, as our slightly more muted near-term revenue growth projections were offset by the time value of money. Despite a 7% year-over-year core sales decline in the third quarter, we were encouraged by Pentairs 140-basis-point year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion, from 19.6% to 21%, driven by pricing, productivity, and margin accretion from the Manitowoc acquisition. Compared with the prior-year period, Pentairs third-quarter core sales were up 1% in industrial and flow technologies, flat in water solutions, and down 21% in pool. The latter had to contend with the ongoing inventory correction in the distribution channel and tough year-over-year comparisons, resulting in a 28% volume decline, partially offset by 7% higher pricing. We think that Pentairs transformation initiatives drove strong margin expansion across all three segments, especially given the revenue headwinds: 250 basis points in industrial and flow technologies, 510 basis points in water solutions, and 130 basis points in pool. Management raised the bottom end of its full-year guidance range by a nickel and now anticipates adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.75. Pentairs updated outlook now assumes in a high-teens sales decline in pool (slightly worse than the midteens decline baked into the previous outlook), but we continue to expect the segment to return to growth after channel inventory levels normalize by the end of 2023. We view the headwinds in pool as temporary, following strong growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the segments long-term prospects as we expect it to benefit from opportunities in pool automation and sustainable water solutions.","Pentair is a pure-play water company poised to benefit from demand for sustainable and energy-efficient water solutions. The pool business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, consistent market share gains, and lucrative operating margins. The acquisitions of Pelican Water and Aquion will bolster Pentairs portfolio of water solutions in the residential and commercial markets.",Growth has been relatively sluggish and may remain elusive in the industrial and flow technologies segment. Persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could make Pentair more susceptible to offshore competition. Cost inflation could be a headwind in the short run.,25/10/2023,"Pentair is a pure-play water company manufacturing a wide range of sustainable water solutions, including energy-efficient swimming pool pumps, filtration solutions, and commercial and industrial pumps. Pentairs business is organized into three segments: pool, water solutions, and industrial and flow technologies. The company benefits from a large installed base of equipment, and over 75% of its products are replacement.  In 2022, Pentair announced an agreement to acquire Manitowoc Ice from Welbilt for roughly $1.6 billion. Manitowoc Ice is a leading producer of commercial ice makers, with roughly 50% market share of cubed ice machines sold in the U.S. From a strategic perspective, we believe that the acquisition will complement Pentairs existing commercial water solutions portfolio and bolster its presence in the foodservice industry. For full-year 2023, management anticipates sales to be down 1% from the prior year. The guidance assumes a high-teens revenue decline in pool, a high-teens revenue increase in water solutions (driven by contribution from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition), and a mid-single-digit revenue increase in industrial and flow technologies. Although Pentairs 2023 pool volumes will be pressured by the inventory correction in the residential channel, we expect the company to return to more normalized growth in 2024. In the long run, we expect Pentair to grow its revenue at a mid-single-digit clip, fueled by opportunities in pool and water solutions. Furthermore, we are encouraged by Pentairs margin expansion since the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. The company has raised its long-term operating margin target by 100 basis points to 23% by 2025, driven by transformation initiatives, cost efficiencies, and the accretive Manitowoc Ice acquisition.","We believe that water treatment company Pentair has developed a narrow moat attributable to customer switching costs and intangible assets. Pentair derives roughly two thirds of its revenue from aftermarket service and replacement parts, which are largely tied to its large installed base. Because many of the companys products (including pumps, filters, and control valves) perform mission-critical functions, any product failures could lead to costly outages for customers. Thus, quality and reliability are paramount, and customers seldom pursue cost savings by switching to cheaper alternatives, which leads to a loyal customer base. We believe the company is well positioned to earn excess economic profits over the next decade thanks to its narrow moat.We believe the pool segment has carved a wide moat, which allows it to generate lucrative mid-20s operating margins. The segment benefits from a large installed base, as roughly 85% of sales come from aftermarket service and repairs. Customer switching costs and intangible assets help Pentair protect the moat surrounding its large installed base. Not only do robust aftermarket sales make revenue less cyclical, they also reduce Pentairs reliance on new construction starts, as the bulk of revenue is derived from the large existing market of over 5 million swimming pools in the U.S.The company revolutionized the swimming pool pump industry when it introduced its IntelliFlo variable-speed pump in 2006. Variable-speed pumps can cut electricity consumption by up to 90%, significantly reducing customers' utility bills. Adoption of variable-speed pumps has been accelerated by a Department of Energy regulation, effective July 19, 2021, establishing minimum energy efficiency of swimming pool pumps. Pentair has seen solid demand for its variable-speed pumps in recent quarters and said in a recent presentation that roughly 60% of pumps it currently sells are variable-speed. While some single-speed models will be compliant in certain applications (such as spas and smaller pools), Pentair's management believes that the variable-speed pump penetration rate could reach roughly 80%-85% by 2022, which leaves room for further growth from current levels. This is a tailwind for Pentair's revenue growth as variable-speed pumps can be 2-2.5 times more expensive than single-speed pumps.Another example of Pentairs innovation is IntelliConnect, a pool automation system that won the Best New Product award at the 2018 International Pool Spa Patio Expo. The system connects multiple pool devices (such as pumps and filters) and allows owners to remotely monitor and control their pools (including lighting, variable speed pumps, and so on) from a smartphone app. We think IntelliConnect has the potential to be another revolutionary product.We believe that Pentair is well positioned to continue increasing the value of its content per pool pad by offering automation solutions, energy-efficient products, and software-enabled devices. Furthermore, we think that connected solutions have the potential to reinforce switching costs in the pool business as we believe that offering an ecosystem that integrates multiple Pentair products and allows customers to remotely monitor and control their pools will enhance customer loyalty.We think water solutions garners a narrow moat primarily due to switching costs. This segment sells products that are critical for its customers operations. As such, a reputation for quality and reliability is decisive, especially in the commercial and industrial verticals, as any product failures could lead to costly outages or downtime. For example, filtration systems are critical for breweries, coffee shops, and commercial fish farms. Customers in these end markets are unlikely to aggressively pursue cost savings by switching to a cheaper alternative, as the cost of outages could outweigh any potential cost savings. As such, customers tend to be loyal, and roughly half of the segments revenue is aftermarket-based. Pentairs moat in water solutions is bolstered by intangible assets. For instance, one of its brands, Everpure, has strong brand equity as a leader in the food and beverage industry, serving well-known companies such as Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and United Airlines. Additionally, Pentair has a strong network of affiliated dealers, which we think will help drive demand in the long term.Finally, the industrial and flow technologies segment benefits from similar dynamics to those in the water solutions business, as reliability is important for customers. This segment also has a large installed base, as roughly 75% of sales are derived from aftermarket services and equipment replacement. While industrial and flow technologies is growing at a slower rate than pool and water solutions, the segment consistently earns operating margins in the midteens, which we think merits a narrow moat.","Pentair has a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium as the company exhibits an average degree of cyclicality. Pentairs risk is somewhat mitigated by its strong brand portfolio and large installed base. A significant portion of the companys revenue is driven by aftermarket sales and replacement parts. For example, the pool business derives roughly 80% of its sales from aftermarket service and replacement parts. As such, the bulk of the segments sales is attributable to over 5 million existing swimming pools in the U.S.; Pentair does not rely solely on new construction starts to increase its revenue in the segment.Significant cost inflation and persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could put a dent in Pentairs profitability. The company recently raised prices across all three business segments to help mitigate the impact of cost inflation. Nonetheless, rising commodity prices, coupled with a strong U.S. dollar, could erode Pentairs margins.Our Medium Uncertainty Rating is not materially affected by environmental, social, and governance risks. We think the largest and potentially most material ESG risks for the company include potential product quality and safety failures and failure to comply with various environmental as well as health and safety laws.","We assign Pentair a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment of the companys balance sheet, managements investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We think that Pentair has a sound balance sheet and that debt maturities are well spread out. We see management's investment history as fair, and we have no reason to expect future investments to be either materially value-accretive or -destructive. Lastly, we think that Pentair's shareholder distributions are appropriate.After serving as CFO for a decade, John Stauch took the helm in 2018, when the company spun off its electrical business as nVent and former CEO Randall Hogan retired. Stauch worked closely with Hogan during a period of heightened M&A activity and played a key role in rightsizing and restructuring acquired businesses. We believe that Pentair will continue to deliver solid margins under his leadership.Management indicated that it will focus on increasing revenue in pool, water solutions, and emerging markets. We expect Pentair to continue pursuing bolt-on and tuck-in M&A opportunities, primarily in the pool and water solutions segments.As far as capital allocation is concerned, management said it will prioritize investments that help expand its core business. Management has also committed to paying a competitive dividend, which we project to keep increasing roughly in line with earnings. In December 2022, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 5%, from $0.21 to $0.22, extending its dividend growth streak to 47 consecutive years. We also expect that management will continue to evaluate opportunistic share-buyback opportunities.","Pentair is a global leader in the water treatment industry, with 10,000 employees and a presence in 25 countries. Pentair's business is organized into two segments: consumer solutions and industrial and flow technologies. The company offers a wide range of water solutions, including energy-efficient swimming pool equipment, filtration solutions, and commercial and industrial pumps. Pentair generated approximately $4.1 billion in revenue and $768 million in adjusted operating income in 2022.","We think that Pentair is on solid financial footing. The company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $2.3 billion of long-term debt while holding $109 million in cash and equivalents. Debt maturities are reasonably well laddered, with no debt maturing in 2023 and only about $200 million maturing in 2024.The company is bound by a debt/EBITDA covenant that requires that the ratio not exceed 3.75 times. We believe that Pentair is in compliance with all relevant covenants, and we estimate it will have a debt/EBITDA ratio of roughly 2.7 times in 2023.",PNR,Industrials,10956017664.0,NYQ,1043144.0,USD,63.220001220703125,True,1,64.67997333302587,72.83773454805853,1
24/11/2023,Fastly Is Making Progress Toward Profitability While Revenue Growth Remains Strong,Fastly Inc,FSLY,3,02/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,17.78,USD,23/11/2023,20.0,Very High,,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"No-moat Fastly continued to see momentum in its business in the third quarter, with the solid execution extending this years trend. Margins have improved dramatically but backtracked a bit this quarter. Usage costs that caused the hiccup should prove temporary, and we expect margin expansion to be back on track by 2024. The after-hours pop in the stock seems excessive, as results were at the top end of guidance and management essentially maintained full-year guidance while raising the midpoints. Nonetheless, the move does bring Fastly closer to where we believe its fairly valued after the recent selloff. Were maintaining our $20 fair value estimate, as nothing in the quarter changes our outlook. Sales were up 18% year over year to about $128 million and continue to show positive underlying trends. Fastly added another 30 customers in the quarter, and more importantly, it is seeing existing customers take more products and spend more. Spending from enterprise customersclassified as customers that spend over $25,000 per quarter, which make up over 90% of Fastlys revenueincreased 5% sequentially. Also, the firms remaining performance obligations, which represent future revenue commitments by customers, grew another 7% sequentially (43% year over year) and now stand at $248 million. As Fastly continues to become stickier with customers and offer more services, including compute and security, we expect it to maintain its double-digit annual growth rate. Gross margin was up about 3 percentage points year over year but down 60 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was positive for the second straight quarteralbeit marginallyafter being negative throughout 2022. We expect Fastly to continue getting operating leverage on its revenue growth and to receive better terms for its traffic costs, leading us to believe there is a long runway for material operating margin expansion each year.",Fastlys modern version of a content delivery network is superior to legacy competitors' and will continue to be favored by developers looking to stay on the cutting edge in todays digital world. The ability to compute at Fastlys edge servers will open a revenue stream previously untapped by CDNs and from a market thats multiple times bigger than the traditional CDN market. Fastlys margins should expand significantly because of its focus on higher-value offerings and the operating leverage resulting from its ability to add security products for existing customers.,"Even if Fastlys approach to CDNs is superior, it doesnt lend itself to durable competitive advantages that can keep competitors from copying its model. If Fastly can move beyond the relatively niche traditional CDN market and make major inroads into edge computing, the major cloud companies will be more intent on crushing Fastly to defend their turf. Decelerating sales growth coupled with an inability to expand margins may keep Fastly from turning profitable and generating cash.",02/11/2023,"Fastly has a new take on the now relatively antiquated model for running content delivery networks, or CDNs. We believe the more modern approach can allow Fastly to continue taking share from legacy CDN providers with a lower-cost model, by way of a smaller geographic footprint.  CDNs are essential for all websites and online content to run expeditiously and without disruption. Traditionally, CDNs would accomplish this by storing copies of website content in as many locations as possible so that any user who wanted to access that content could tap a more local server rather than traversing great distances to access the origin server, which also had to meet all other requests from around the globe. However, the legacy model was designed for static content, meaning content that will not change for a given period. Fastly is in relatively few locations79 markets at the end of 2022but gives its customers the ability to write programs on its servers, enabling its CDN to handle more dynamic and personalized content than a traditional CDN could. Consumers demand this type of content for things like e-commerce, banking, and even subscription media, and Fastly focuses on this rather than static content like video-on-demand streaming. Fastlys approach results in better performance for anything but the type of static content that would be stored on a traditional large network of CDN servers. In other words, Fastly can serve more types of content from its edge servers than traditional CDNs, avoiding the need to draw content from central servers in more situations. In our view, Fastlys best opportunity is to further build on its approach, so rather than simply increasing share in the traditional CDN market, it can perform more of the functions that customers currently rely on at centralized servers. Fastlys new Compute@Edge feature is designed to make strides in this area. Taking a bigger share of customers wallets by offering this type of capability could significantly increase Fastlys addressable market, and Fastlys targeting of very large enterprise customers means slight gains in wallet share can translate to very high amounts of absolute dollars.","We dont think Fastly presently has an economic moat protecting its business. Fastly has a more modern approach to running a content delivery network that enables it to offer equivalent or superior service, depending on the task, with fewer points of presence, or PoPs, and less commitment of capital. Further, because of the open-source nature of the technology that is integral to how its network runs, with customers able to share in the innovations of others, the basis for a network effect exists. Regardless of whether Fastly ever could attain a moat, we dont believe it has one yet. The company is still too young and too small, and although it may have a nice head start as the provider of a more modern and higher-capability CDN, we dont think Fastlys position would prevent a hypothetical new competitor entering the market today from competing effectively. Even if Fastly becomes the dominant CDN, we question whether its network effect would be strong enough to form a moat by itself, as we have traditionally not believed CDNs lend themselves to forming durable competitive advantages. We dont see a reason why competitors with bigger customer bases, such as Akamai and the major cloud providers, couldnt take a similar tack.Content delivery networks allow consumers to have better experiences using the internet. Any content that an entity makes available for online consumption originates from one or a few of its core servers worldwide, whether its own proprietary servers or some of those from its public cloud provider. These origin servers store the entirety of an entitys content and do the computations necessary to personalize or update changes. However, if every interaction of every user required retrieval of information from an origin server, it would lead to higher latency for those that are not physically nearby and would make it more likely for websites to become overwhelmed, leading to slow and frustrating user experiences, including website crashes. Content delivery networks are networks of servers that ease the workload on origin servers and bring content geographically closer to more consumers. Traditional CDNs were designed for static content, with edge CDN servers merely being used to cache content, meaning they store a copy of the original file (and static meaning the data file isnt constantly changing). Users of the modern internet, however, are much more dependent on experiences that are more personalized and dynamic, thereby not lending themselves as well to caching. Fastly focuses much more on this type of content and customer, and it de-prioritizes services like video-on-demand streaming, which requires only static files. When serving personalized and dynamic content, Fastly is not at a disadvantage by having far fewer PoPs than some competitors, because those PoPs wouldnt be caching the content anyway.Fastly is designed to serve its customer at its edge servers and avoid requiring trips to the origin servers as much as possible. Fastly allows its customers developers to write code for the edge servers, so if content on a website has a very short shelf-life the changes can be handled on the Fastly servers. Fastly is not completely unique in being able to offer edge computing and other capabilities that allow its CDN to handle more dynamic content, which Akamai can now do as well. However, the evolution that allows this, in our view, mitigates the advantage that Akamai has with its large legacy footprint, which was more advantageous in the prior generation of internet service. Essentially, what Fastly has accomplished, in our view, is to put itself in the same league as other top-quality CDNs in competing for the business of the biggest companies in the world rather than give itself a durable advantage over competitors. The place where Fastly has differentiated itself is in targeting developers, that are critical not only to digital-native companies like Shopify and Spotify, but to all companies looking to compete in todays world. Unlike legacy competitors, it allows developers to essentially control their own accounts and constantly write code and iterate to improve the performance of their web content, rather than following the typical, structured processes with legacy CDNs. On top of this flexibility being friendly for developers, the process is open for all customers to see and share with each other, meaning that improvements made by any customer through their own trials and errors can be implemented and be jumping off points for other customers. Nothing stops others from implementing a similar strategy. We believe that Akamai and the major cloud providers, that also run CDNs, could immediately begin to leverage information coming from even bigger customer bases if they though it was critical for them to compete long term. Until Fastly gains similar market share as its bigger competitors or achieves a network that is clearly better than its peers, we dont think any seeds of a network effect will be sufficient to create a moat-worthy barrier.The only other moat source that we think is worth considering for Fastly is switching costs, but we dont believe those are prohibitive. We have no doubt that for the sake of continuity and risk mitigation, developers would prefer to remain on CDNs that are performing well, and metrics to date show that Fastlys customers dont leave, as it routinely has a 99% revenue retention rate each year. However, we dont think theres any true barrier to a customer leaving if it can better meet its needs elsewhere, and crucially, we dont believe that switching actually requires a complete abandoning of a CDN provider. Firms tend to use multiple CDNs, so switching may take the form of shifting workload levels between providers, which can mitigate the risk that would come with leaving a CDN provider altogether but allows customers to give a bigger portion of the business to an alternate provider if it better suits its business. Finally, we think Fastlys potential for success is partially based on the premise that there are not major switching costs in the industry, as we expect it to take revenue share from Akamai. If Fastlys success in the industry can come from finding a better solution and taking share, we dont see why the next Fastly wouldnt be able to do it down the line if it similarly could offer a better service.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Fastly is Very High. We see the potential for significant upside but no assurances that its business can continue to thrive if further competition arises. We believe the need for CDNs continues to grow and that additional edge computing capabilities will bring business that CDNs previously wouldnt have been good candidates to serve. Fastly is poised to capture its fair share of the market. If it can do that, its business still has high upside. However, we are not yet convinced it has durable competitive advantages that can shield it from competitors, and we think its stock has a lot of room to drop if sales growth materially decelerates.The biggest risk, in our view, is that numerous companies can provide a similar service, which could lead to significant competition. Not only is Fastly directly taking on Akamai, a large incumbent that we think can offer a similar model, but the largest cloud providers also offer CDNs. There are reasons we think Fastly currently has an edge, primarily its laser focus on catering to its customers developers needs and that it keeps customers from becoming too reliant on a single cloud provider, but the lack of a more durable advantage against large, well-funded competitors makes Fastly susceptible.From an environmental, social, and governance standpoint, we think the greatest risk to Fastly is a cybersecurity breach. Fastly handles companies and consumers most sensitive information on its servers, so the financial and reputational damage that could follow a major data breach could be devastating. Fastly also has risk emanating from its ability to attract and retain the best and brightest minds in software engineering. As a capital-light business, employees and the intellectual property they generate are Fastlys most valuable assets. Anything that makes it more difficult to stay on the cutting edge of technological advancement could hurt Fastlys competitive positioning.","We assign Fastly a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. Our rating considers Fastlys balance sheet and shareholder distribution strategy but is primarily based on managements investment decisions, both historically and what we expect in the future.Fastlys balance sheet is in decent shapeat the end of 2022, it had about $700 million in debt and $500 million in cash and marketable securitiesand we think its decision to avoid any return of capital to shareholders for what we expect to be an extended period is appropriate. Fastly has yet to generate cash flow from its operations in a fiscal year, and we expect it will need to raise more cash before the business becomes self-supporting. We also believe it must continue investing aggressively in its business to allow it to compete on a similar scale to bigger and more mature competitors and take advantage of opportunities we believe the market is already implying for its stock. For these reasons, we agree that its capital should be used exclusively to expand its business.We believe the firms investment historically has been positive, and we have confidence that management will continue to add value through investments. We think Fastlys 2020 acquisition of Signal Sciences was smart, as Signal Sciences was a respected company that deepened Fastlys ability to offer security solutions, which we think are vital for CDNs. The total cost$775 millionwas not large in absolute terms, and Fastly financed it primarily with its own stock, which was a perfect choice of currency, in our opinion, because it was very expensive relative to any traditional metric and offset any eyebrows we might have raised for the similarly inflated multiple paid for Signal Sciences (implied at about 25 times sales). Although we believe future investment decisions will continue to be positive for Fastly, we dont see enough of a record, or the likelihood for game-changing investment choices that could cement a durable competitive advantage, to award the firm an Exemplary rating.","Fastly operates a content delivery network, which is necessary for entities to provide faster and more reliable online content. Fastlys strategy differs from traditional CDNs, which focus on locating servers in as many locations as possible to store copies of files that consumers most use. Fastly is in far fewer sites than traditional CDNs, but it houses servers in the most network-dense data centers. Instead of simply storing static content, it allows its customers to program on its platform, enabling edge computing and better service of the more dynamic content that was traditionally not well served by CDNs. Fastly gears its service to the largest, most sophisticated enterprises rather than small companies and generated nearly three fourths of its revenue in the United States in 2022.","Fastlys cash position puts it in decent financial shape, but the company will need to raise more capital, in our view, and issuing stock no longer seems like an easy path to fund all needs. At the end of 2022, Fastly had about $700 million in debt and $500 million in cash and marketable securities. However, the company continues to burn cash and has never generated positive operating cash flow in its history as a public company. We project that the firm is a couple of years away from generating positive free cash flow and being able to support itself. The sky-high valuations in its stock during 2020 and 2021 would have given it great opportunity to issue more equity, but it didnt take advantage at the time, and it may now need to rely on debt more. Not only is issuing equity now much less attractive, but it will likely not be adequate to provide all the proceeds Fastly will need.A byproduct of the less favorable financial position is the lessened flexibility that Fastly has to acquire small companies to bolster its offering. We think Fastly would benefit from adding companies that could enhance its security services, but the inability to use its stock as currency will likely limit the firms chances to do that. Making acquisitions is not foreclosed, but we think it is now more difficult and management will be forced to be more selective.",FSLY,Technology,2360939776.0,NYQ,2969986.0,USD,17.780000686645508,True,1,18.437647168781176,17.49160500515185,0
25/11/2023,"BRP's Continued Investments in Newness Drive Market Share Gains, Indicating Brand Prowess",BRP Inc,DOO,4,,Jaime Katz,98.32,CAD,24/11/2023,135.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,B,,No Text Available,"BRP has white-space opportunities to expand the business faster than we expect, particularly in the marine business and some niches (like electric) of the year-round lines. Demand from underpenetrated international markets and expansion into new markets like China could lead to demand growing faster than we forecast, which could raise utilization and productivity, leading to higher profitability. Marine will comprise a larger proportion of sales to the company over time, which could generate a better-than-expected operating margin as the category scales, providing cash flow upside.","Protracted inflation in costs, including commodities, labor, or logistics, could hurt profitability for longer than we currently anticipate. BRP competes with some formidable brand names, such as Polaris and Honda in the snowmobile and ATV sectors, which have higher sales and deeper pockets for advertising and promotional spending. Business depends on credit availability in wholesale and retail segments. The withdrawal of  financing sources could prevent inventory from retailing quickly.",12/09/2023,"Fiscal 2024 (ending January) should be another solid year for BRP's sales thanks to resilient consumer demand across its year-round segment (48% of fiscal 2023 revenue). With a team that remains focused on its long-term product and operational priorities, we believe BRP should continue to maintain strong competitive positioning. BRP's strategic priorities focus on market share growth, lean operations, and cultivating an engaged workforce, all while honing in on evolving customer demands. With manufacturing facilities located near demand (for example, personal watercraft in Mexico) and timely spend to increase facility capacity as needed, BRP should continue to capture efficiencies from its plants. Firmwide centers of expertise and excellence allow BRP to manufacture optimally, improving utilization and allowing it to bring products to market quickly, ensuring a continually relevant and in-demand product lineup (with electric vehicle offerings expected in all segments by 2026). Because BRP is exposed to many customer segments, we dont believe acquisitions are required for expansion. However, we think entry into white-space categories (like motorcycles) and small acquisitions, particularly in parts and accessories or marine, are possible and could support growth. BRP has fiscal 2025 goals of CAD 12 billion-CAD 12.5 billion in sales and CAD 13.50-CAD 14.50 in EPS, levels we view as largely reasonable. We forecast sales of CAD 11.4 billion and EPS of CAD 13.66 in fiscal 2025. Demand has persisted despite economic uncertainty, and innovation should continue to drive sales, particularly in the marine segment where BRP has launched Project Ghost (altering placement of outboard engines) and the Sea-Doo Switch (marine is expected to grow to CAD 1 billion by 2025, from CAD 490 billion in 2023, according to BRP, although we model CAD 555 million given recent softness). In our base case, BRP's innovation and leading market share position indicate a brand intangible asset. Due to improvements to the manufacturing process and scale, we believe BRP has also developed a cost edge. Together, these factors support competitive returns on invested capital and a wide economic moat.","We recently raised our economic moat rating for BRP to wide from narrow, as we think performance at the business signals an enhanced brand intangible asset and the acquisition of a cost advantage. On the brand side, innovation has consistently won with consumers, thanks to healthy research and development spending, resulting in impressive market share metrics, which we dont believe will recede. Additionally, the evolving sales composition of the enterprise, given the firms entrance into the boat manufacturing business (for example, with the purchase of Manitou in 2018) and exit from the boat engine business (Evinrude) in 2020, has elevated the return on product development costs, while lifting the perception and profitability of the enterprise. As evidence of BRPs brand prowess, we look to its ability to capture industry leading market share. We posit much of the brand staying power is contingent upon perpetual spend on research and development to ensure the firm has a pipeline of compelling new products to entice its addressable market. We surmise BRP will spend around 4% on sales over the next five years on such efforts, which represents about CAD 450 million annually, in line with peers like wide-moat Polaris. Such efforts have allowed BRP to hold a solid leadership position (closing in on 30% market share in side by sides) in the off-road market, alongside companies like Polaris and Honda (year-round products, including ATVs, constituted 48% of fiscal 2023 sales). And while the side-by-side market didnt fully develop until the late 2000s, BRP has been able to garner share leadership there as well, closing in on Polaris mid- to high-30% range. Impressively, in ATVs, Can-Am's (BRPs category brand) market share, has grown to a mid-20% rate from a high-single-digit level over the past 10 years (more than double). This is as North American manufacturers have taken increasing share from Japanese OEMs and compares to Polaris consistent 30% share and Arctic Cat's low-single-digit share (down from a high-single-digit level), according to Powersports Business and our estimates. Not only has the firm been successful in capturing consumer interest in off-road products, but its brand has been a perpetual market share leader in personal watercraft (PWC) thanks to the best-in-class products offered. In this context, BRPs market share has averaged north of 50% over the past decade, with management recently citing it has controlled as much as 65% of the space. We surmise this prominence will remain, as PWC is a very consolidated industry, with only three key players. Due to the limited scale (the total market was only 114,000 units globally in 2022, according to the most recent data available from BRP), we dont expect any new entrants will begin to operate, as utilization would be limited at best and returns for all operators would probably be diminished if demand were to be split further among manufacturers. While a new entrant could build a facility that is sized for demand, startup costs (building a facility, hiring workers, acquiring proper equipment) would probably prevent the endeavor from being economically sensible (even if it were able to carve out share gains), as payoff periods would be extensive.Similar barriers to entry (limited global unit demand) benefit the firms presence in snowmobiles, where consumers continue to prefer the BRP brand for purchase. According to BRP, the company controlled a whopping 61% of the market in 2022. This is from around 50% in the five years before the pandemic, a level we think BRP is likely to return toward as supply chain constraints ease across the industry (though still impressive, in our opinion). Like PWC, the industry is composed of only four manufacturers making up most units produced (along with Yamaha, Polaris, and Arctic Cat), placating concerns that share shifts will degrade any time soon, especially with BRP remaining dedicated to innovation in the category (and Yamaha recently announcing its exit from the industry). This aligns with our forecast for BRPs sales to largely grow in line with industry growth of 3% through 2030 (according to Allied Market Research).Quantitatively, brand resonance with consumers can be ascertained via pricing power, which ultimately surfaces in improving gross margin performance. BRPs average gross margin over the last five years ending January 2023 was 25% (including the pandemic related bump in 2020-2022 where the metric averaged 25.8%), versus 24% in the five years prior, even as the firm has faced inflationary headwinds in both inputs and logistics costs. This metric is now in line with wide-moat Polaris. We dont think the well for gross margin gains is tapped out, with our forecast calling for a modest expansion annually to 25.5% in fiscal 2033, above the 23.9% the company averaged in the five years leading up to the pandemic. Additionally, we think the brand is supported thanks to BRPs robust, 3,000 global location dealer network that has been built over the past five decades, supporting customer reach. These dealers will be instrumental in helping BRP tap into a growing total addressable market. For reference, in 2021-22, 30% of purchasers were new to the category (historically, this figure has run at less than 20%), a pattern that is unlikely to abate. From its own survey, BRP found that over the next 10 years, 30%-50% of new product owners are expected to be people that dont currently own a powersports product and have not participated in the past decade. That should bring a significant number of potential repeat clients into the fold, offering more support for future product replacement and expansion growth (in subsequent purchases, clients have been increasing the amount of spend at BRP). Although most of these are not exclusive BRP dealers and BRP products share floor space with competitor offerings, we think new competitors would have to develop a high-volume business to garner any negotiating power with vendors and move significant inventory through the retail channel (which we view as unlikely). It would take some lead time to set up a new manufacturing facility, produce product and inventory, and have dealers commit to selling these new products. As such, we view BRPs relationships with its distribution base as strong. Considering all of the aforementioned brand demand and given a still solid opportunity set for brand reach, we think BRPs intangible assets should persist for more than 20 years.Furthermore, as BRPs sales and manufacturing processes have scaled, we think the firm has captured a cost advantage. BRP now has the ability to spread fixed costs over higher volumes, negotiate better with vendors, and manufacture more efficiently, with a factory footprint that is more competitive than in the past and a more favorable product mix (boats rather than marine engines). These factors have led to structurally higher operating margins and improving ROICs, which we dont expect to recede. For reference, when we initially rated BRP as narrow moat in 2015, sales were less than half 2023 levels (CAD 3.8 billion in fiscal 2016 versus around CAD 9.9 billion in fiscal 2023). Initially, most of its sales stemmed from BRPs year-round (38% of fiscal 2016 sales) and seasonal (36%) segments, categories which still comprise roughly 80% of sales, implying interest in the legacy lines has not waned despite robust growth in its newest segment, marine. Impressively, both segments maintain a sound pulse on the consumer, with year-round sales rising 18% and seasonal sales climbing 22% on average over the past five years (significantly faster than average all-terrain vehicles (ATV)/off road vehicles (ORV) and personal watercraft (PWC) industry unit sales growth of 2% and 4%, respectively). But this growth hasnt come at a cost. Over the same time frame, operating margins have climbed 530 basis points to 14%, indicating the efficiency gains that have ensued. We partly attribute the profitable growth that has manifest to prudent changes to product exposure management has overseen. For one, BRP has expanded into marine, acquiring the Alumacraft and Manitou brands in 2018, which together generated about CAD 200 million in sales at time of purchase and have grown to represent sales of CAD 490 million in 2023 (5% of total). We think this segment offers BRP the opportunity for improved brand awareness and top-line growth as the firm expects the segment will climb to CAD 1 billion in sales by fiscal 2025, supported by innovation that leads to consumer interest and new entrants in the boating market (our estimate is around CAD 555 million, taking into consideration a tempering consumer sentiment). With BRP quantifying the global marine market at CAD 36 billion (2022), we believe BRP holds just a low-single-digit share of the overall marine market, and we think the boat business should continue to provide a lift to BRPs brand visibility fueled by consumer-valued new products. Even if the marine business grows to just 5% of the total boat market through product expansions and acquisitions over time, it would represent a CAD 1.8 billion opportunity, and thats with no growth considered for the total boat market (which we view as unlikely). Admittedly, the recent lift in sales from boats was partially offset by the 2020 shuttering of its marine engine business (Evinrude), which contributed roughly CAD 400 million per year to sales. We found this move prudent given Evinrudes underperformance relative to BRPs other businesses, as the boat engines attempts to crack into the packaged segment in a meaningful way stalled, signaling that significant performance improvement initiatives would have had to be implemented to bring profitability of Evinrude up to company levels. Given the time and capital that would have to be allocated to such an effort, BRP chose to exit, rather than invest in, the line. Additionally, we posit having competitively located manufacturing facilities (close to demand, lower labor costs) now gives the company the ability to remain an efficient and low-cost competitor ahead. And we dont believe the manufacturing gains can be easily replicated, given that the cost improvements achieved have been undertaken over more than 15 years. To start, in 2007, BRP had just one factory in Juarez, Mexico. Not until 2013 did the firm open further capacity in the region to capture cost advantages from labor expenses and speed to market, with the opening of its Queretaro facility, focused on the production of PWC. After that, the firm added extra capacity in Juarez (off-road vehicles) and Queretaro across multiple phases, which are not set for completion until 2024, when 75% of the firms products are expected to be produced in the region. With further capacity and product lines (motorcycles) set for production in Mexico beyond 2023, risk of stock outs or capacity bounds are less likely to occur. We think it would be highly unlikely that another competitor would enter the market, take enough share to warrant similar cost efficiencies, and have the operating structure to yield performance near BRP or Polaris levels over any reasonable time frame, given the already highly concentrated condition across the industry.Moreover, a new entrant would have to have access to capital. To facilitate BRPs production growth, capital expenditures averaged CAD 400 million over the last five years (6% of sales), up from averaging CAD 175 million from 2014-2018, and we expect this figure to increase to CAD 720 million over the next five years, positioning the firm to maximize utilization. For BRP, even with increased capital and operating expenditures, operating margins have climbed to 14% in 2023 from 9% in 2017, exhibiting impressive cost leverage. Moreover, we think the companys cost controls can continue to improve as the brand expands into white space categories, like motorcycles, electric products, and new categories (for example, a new product like the Sea-Doo Switch), areas that leverage the existing knowledge base and manufacturing lines to facilitate growth. Over time, expenses should benefit from these factors, displaying the firms cost advantage, via lower spending on distribution costs as units ship efficientlygiven the manufacturing location in the Southwest, near demand); leveraging overhead expenses from rising shipments; and lower material, freight, and labor costs with the additional capacity coming online. Our longer-term forecast calls for BRP to generate operating margins of 12%, around our long-term operating margin forecast for Polaris, indicating that BRP has closed the gap on its closest wide moat competitor with respect to profit levels. Over the last five years, BRP has delivered ROICs including goodwill of 42%, significantly above our 10% weighted average cost of capital estimate. And we believe ongoing efforts to build out incremental manufacturing capacity and launch new products will allow ROICs to continue to outpace its cost of capital over a multidecade horizon, with our explicit forecast averaging 27% over the next decade.","BRP has a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating because its product lineup creates some volatility for revenue and profit during periods of economic duress. BRP faces a number of risks regarding the demand for its products. The powersports industry already has a number of players that can compete on price to take share from BRP. In ATVs, Polaris and Honda are formidable players, while in snowmobiles, BRP also has to compete with key rival Arctic Cat and Polaris. There are industry constituents that also have sizable franchises and financial resources, which could cause the competitive environment to become promotional. Snowmobiles, ATVs, side-by-sides, and personal watercraft are big-ticket items, and a protracted slowdown in the global economy could hamper demand for these recreational products. Another domestic downturn could also affect dealer willingness to take on additional floor plan financing. While BRP has agreements with financing firms to provide third-party inventory financing in many countries, it carries some liability in the event of dealer or distributor default. Litigation risk remains a concern, often with respect to patent infringement. Also, weather is the biggest factor that BRP cannot control. Sales of snowmobiles are correlated with the amount of snowfall, often making volume in the segment volatile. Foreign-exchange exposure could prove unpredictable as the firm grows internationally, if the U.S. dollar and euro trade widely versus the Canadian dollar (BRP's home currency). Additionally, part of the workforce is covered by collective agreements, which could result in work stoppages if work agreements cannot be reached.The most relevant environmental, social, and governance risk surrounds safety issues related to using powersports products, which can result in recalls (and weigh on the firm's brand equity). There are also risks over intellectual property infringement, public listing requirements, and talent acquisition and retention.","We assign BRP an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. Forecast adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill (29% on average over the next five years) are set to handily outpace our weighted cost of capital estimate (at 10%) over our entire outlook, and the balance sheet remains sound, given the company's medium leverage. The company has little coming due over the next few years, and the absolute level of debt on the balance sheet is very manageable. With net debt/adjusted EBITDA that should average below 1 over the next decade, there is plenty of financial flexibility on the balance sheet.From a leadership perspective, the C-suite has been fairly stable in recent years, with Jose Boisjoli at the helm since the company divested from its parent in 2003 and Sebastien Martel in the CFO slot since 2014. We hold a positive view on management's investment strategy, as we think it is spending strategically to maintain its competitive advantages and respond rapidly to evolving demand. Quantitatively, we believe this is supported by robust ROICs (including goodwill) and healthy operating margin performance (at 12% at the end of our forecast).Strong returns have persisted even as the firm has purchased outside companies to widen its marine business. First, in June 2018, BRP acquired Alumacraft Boat (aluminum fishing boats) for around CAD 85 million. At the time of purchase, Alumacraft was generating an estimated CAD 120 million in annual sales, implying BRP paid about 0.7 times sales, lower than the 1.2 times average transaction multiples boat acquisitions were enjoying around that time. Then, in August 2018, BRP acquired Triton Industries (a manufacturer of pontoon boats under the Manitou brand) for around CAD 100 million. With an estimated CAD 80 million in sales at the key Manitou brand, this transaction was a bit richer at 1.25 times sales, but still not out of the norm, particularly given Manitou's exposure to the popular pontoon market. Then, in August 2019, BRP acquired a majority stake (80%) of Telwater (a manufacturer of aluminum boats and trailers under the brands Quintrex, Stacer, and Savage in Australia) for around AUD 120 million. Telwater (now fully owned) was estimated to generate CAD 80 million-CAD 90 million in sales, implying a richer 1.8 times price/sales multiple on this tie-up as well (when grossed up for the additional 20% initially excluded). Given the still-strong enterprise level returns, we think these purchased additions should be viewed favorably from a due diligence perspective. We believe the company will look to opportunistically add companies to its portfolio that will help better vertically integrate the business or those that fill knowledge gaps for pipeline products (like for electric). Most recently, we saw this with two tie-ups in August 2022. First, BRP acquired 80% of the outstanding shares of Pinion GmbH (for EUR 62 million), a firm focused on mechanical gearboxes for traditional and electric bicycles. Then, in October 2022, BRP acquired Kongsberg Automotive ASA for $127.8 millionKongsberg focuses on electronic and mechatronic product development and manufacturing, and had previously been a supplier to BRP. We deem cash distributions as appropriate, with the management team returning capital to shareholders when optimal. It suspended share repurchases early in the COVID-19 cycle but executed a CAD 250 million substantial issuer bid in fiscal 2023, as well as a CAD 350 million SIB in fiscal 2022 given the strong demand that persisted throughout the pandemic. The company launched a new NCIB for 3.5 million shares for utilization until December 2023, allowing further return of capital to shareholders. Additionally, BRP initiated a dividend in 2019, actively returning capital to shareholders through a new channel.","BRP designs, develops, manufactures, distributes, and markets snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and personal watercraft under the Ski-Doo, Sea-Doo, Can-Am, and Lynx brand names. It also builds engines under the Rotax brand (after shuttering the Evinrude outboard engine business in 2020) and offers clothing, parts, and accessories that cater to its core consumers. In 2018, BRP created a marine group, acquiring boat manufacturers Alumacraft, Triton (which makes Manitou pontoon boats), and Telwater (in Australia). At the end of fiscal 2023, the company sold its products through a network of more than 2,600 independent dealers and 150 distributors in about 130 countries.","BRP has been reducing its leverage ratio over the last decade, taking debt/adjusted EBITDA down to 1.7 times at the end of fiscal 2023 from more than 4 times in 2011, as profitability has improved. We dont find it surprising that significant leverage was taken on under the management of private equity partners, and we expect leverage will continue to be contained with the company remaining publicly held. The firm is comfortable operating below its targeted leverage ratio of 2 times EBITDA, and we think it could be around 1.5 times at the end of fiscal 2024. BRP has a $1.5 billion term loan set to mature in May 2027 and a $500 million term loan due 2029. In normal operating periods, the company expects cash on hand, cash from operations, and utilization of the credit facility should allow it to meet capital expenditure, working capital, and debt service needs. The firm has agreements in place with companies like Wells Fargo and TCF to provide floor-plan financing for dealers. The company maintains flexibility in its capital structure through stock repurchases. BRP continued on its normal course issuer bid in fiscal 2024, repurchasing 2 million shares through July 31, 2023. In fiscal 2023, BRP repurchased around 464,000 subordinate voting shares, and also executed a substantial issuer bid for 2.4 million shares in fiscal 2022 (for CAD 250 million). In November 2022, BRP announced a normal course issuer bid for roughly 3.5 million shares, running until December 2023. Additionally, the firm returns excess cash to shareholders via a quarterly dividend of CAD 0.18 per share, which we believe could rise at a 20% clip over the long term.",DOO.TO,Consumer Cyclical,6470851584.0,TOR,843000.0,CAD,99.19000244140624,True,1,103.13210460117737,88.65175768224267,0

We view Objective as a company that has successfully carved out its niche but is operating in a relatively mature market. We forecast revenue to grow organically at a 10-year CAGR of 6% over the next decade and EBIT margins to expand to 21% from 19%, primarily due to an increased capitalization rate of research and development. We use a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%. We assign Objective a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High and rate its Capital Allocation as Exemplary. At current prices, Objectives shares screen as materially overvalued. We view Objective as a well-managed, founder-led software company that has successfully carved out a niche in software for enterprise content management in Australia and New Zealand. We consider the business high-quality due to its government customer base, recurring revenue streams, and high switching costs. However, we believe Objectives core ECM product suite operates in a relatively mature market. We estimate organic revenue grew at a CAGR of just 4% over the past five years in the segment, despite this period having outsize demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, gross margins across the group declined to 93% from 96% over the period, despite a transition away from services over the period, which also points to a maturing market, in our view. We, therefore, expect most of Objectives future growth to come from newer, industry-specific applications of ECM software, such as for assessing building development applications and compiling new regulations, as these markets are still at a lower stage of maturity. We also believe Objective will increasingly have the capacity to deploy capital into these areas, due to the mature nature of its core ECM product suite.","Objective has successfully carved out a niche in ECM software in the public sector in Australia and New Zealand.  Objectives business is of exceptionally high-quality due to its government customer base, a highly recurring revenue model and high switching costs. Objective has expanded into several industry-specific applications for ECM software, which creates significant growth opportunities. ","Objectives key competitors are an order of magnitude the size of Objective and can use their greater operating leverage to charge lower fees to win customers.  Objectives core ECM software operates in a relatively mature market, meaning incremental customers may be difficult and costly to acquire. A large share of Objectives revenue growth in recent years has come from acquisitions and Objective risks overpaying.",02/11/2023,"We expect Objectives strategy to focus on investing heavily to continue expanding its product portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Over the past decade, Objective invested heavily to adapt its core enterprise content management software suite to evolving customer needs, especially around the transition to the cloud and remote working. We view these trends as maturing and we dont see other trends requiring a similar magnitude of investment on the horizon. As such, we believe Objective will increasingly have capacity to deploy capital into more industry-specific applications of ECM, such as for assessing building development applications and compiling new regulations. We view the expansion into planning and building most favorably, with Objectives products already commanding dominant market shares in Australia and New Zealand, both of which have outsize construction sectors. ","We assign Objective a narrow economic moat based on switching costs.We believe Objectives economic moat is most prominent in its traditional software for enterprise content management in the Australian public sector. ECM software provides organizations with the required structures and processes to manage their content in a manner which ensures quality standards are met, especially in high-stakes communications. This structure is delivered by enforcing standards across the life cycle of content, such as how information is gathered, located, accessed, supplemented, authored, collaborated on, signed off on, and shared externally. These standards can relate to both form and substance, such as consistency in branding and messaging, as well as standards around turnaround time and through which channels content is delivered. Organizations may use ECM software to manage their high-stakes communications, such as content for marketing purposes, public relations, or for their service delivery. Public sector organizations are particularly reliant on ECM software due to the high-stakes nature of their communications. For example, broadcasted content, such as content on websites, social media, or in physical materials, sets public expectations around the applicability of policy and regulation to their situation. Similarly, direct communications with the public, such as decisions by bureaucrats around permits and licenses, affects an increasingly large share of peoples lives. These communications therefore need to ensure that they are compliant with government regulations, policies, and standards. Public sector organizations spend significant time and resources to enforce standards across the content life cycle. Public sector organizations are especially stringent around setting up and enforcing rules around how information is stored and deleted, who is allowed to access documents, including documents with sensitive information, what the applicable decision frameworks are, and who has the authority to provide final sign-off on decisions. Setting up an ECM system creates significant switching costs, in our view. Essentially, each organization has unique requirements around the standards it believes are important and as an ECM system is set up, these standards become codified into software configurations. Also, these standards, we believe, are often shaped through the interaction of an organization with an ECM software provider and are therefore only captured in these systems, rather than also being codified externally. As such, ECM software becomes highly embedded in an organizations workflows, more than is typical for software implementation, which creates significant barriers to transferring these standards and configurations to a different ECM provider. We also believe this is especially the case in public sector organizations, who are highly particular around their standards given the high-stakes nature of their communications. Additionally, within the public sector, ECM software is usually part of mission-critical processes, such as the delivery of services to the public. As such, migrating to a new software provider creates significant risk to the operations of an organization, as migrations may be delayed, incomplete, or fail altogether, thereby risking an organizations core services. Given that government organizations in our view naturally self-select for risk-averse personality types, who experience little benefit from switching providers, we also see little incentive to switching.Unsurprisingly, customer switching is extremely rare for Objective. Objective boasts an industry-leading 99% annual customer retention rate for its 1000-plus customers of which around a hundred have been customers for over a decade. ","We assign Objective a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High.We see high risk from competitive pressures. Objectives core ECM products are deeply embedded into its customers workflows and would require significant switching costs to replace, as evidenced by Objectives 99% annual customer retention rates. However, Objectives key competitors are an order of magnitude larger, meaning they have the resources to develop their products at a much larger scale and potentially charge lower fees to win customers. We see low risk from economic cyclicality. Objectives customer base consists almost entirely of government clients, meaning revenue quality is exceptionally high and unlikely to be affected by the economic cycle. ECM software is also essential to government operations and therefore nondiscretionary. ","Objective has an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, reflecting our assessment of a sound balance sheet, exceptional investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions.Objectives balance sheet is sound, with over AUD 70 million in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt.We rate investment efficacy as exceptional. Objective has successfully navigated several large shifts in customer demand for ECM software, such as the transition to the cloud and remote working. We are also positive on Objectives track record in acquisitions, with companies typically being acquired at reasonable multiples and quickly being incorporated into Objectives product suite.Objective distributes over half of earnings to shareholders in dividends, which we view as appropriate and leaving sufficient funding for further strategic acquisitions. ","Objective Corporation is a founder-led technology company providing software and services for compliance with government regulations. Objectives primary business is its content management software for the Australian public sector, which ensures government information can be gathered, located, accessed, supplemented, authored, collaborated on, signed off on, and shared in a compliant manner. Objective also offers products which encompass industry-specific applications of enterprise content management software, such as for assessing building development applications, compiling new regulations and providing ministerial briefs.","Objectives balance sheet is sound.As of the end of June 2023, Objective held over AUD 70 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.

24/11/2023,AXAs Tilt to Commercial Insurance and Technical Income Shows Nascent Positive Signs,AXA SA,AXAHY,3,,Henry Heathfield,30.77,USD,23/11/2023,31.5,Medium,,Standard,,,No Text Available,"We think AXA has carved out a leading micro business and SMB European commercial insurance offering. The companys acquisition of XL expands the companys commercial insurance portfolio to larger accounts and North America, which can be very profitable if underwritten well. With the sale of AXA Equitable, purchase of XL, and continued work the company has rebalanced its portfolio so that over three-quarters of its earnings are technical.","AXA has not generated historical economic profits and returns. While we like AXAs acquisition of XL, the company has yet to prove it can generate market-leading or peer-equivalent maintainable returns. While AXA has continued to reduce its impact on climate change and exposure to natural catastrophes, a full market shock would wipe out any economic profit forecasts.",23/11/2023,"AXA is a large European multiline insurer that has been on a path of renewed focus and transformation. While its renewed focus may still be a little elusive and it will always be hard for such a large insurer to achieve, given the nature of this business, the company has clearly made strong inroads in transforming its business model to one that is less focused on life and savings. Historically, these lines of business have contributed over half of AXAs revenue and earnings. Yet, as the company took some deliberate actions to sell its North American savings business, shift its products to more technical-based income in Switzerland, and purchase a more North American-focused commercial property and casualty insurer with the proceeds, this is by and large a technical income-based, albeit large and diversified, insurance business. Alongside the developed markets of France, the U.S., and Northern Europe, we think the company holds solid property and casualty insurance businesses and relationships in developed as well as emerging markets in Asia. Alongside this shift toward more technical sources of earnings where there is limited or no reliance on profit on investment income, we think AXA has invested in technology. While we cannot attribute the exact root cause of this, we know that AXA has invested in utilizing geographical data to better assess risks and decline or reprice business. Further, data and technology have been used to access driver safety and improve claims automation. While frequently overlooked, the latter is increasingly important in insurance to get ahead of all forms of inflation. We think AXAs historical commercial insurance sweet spot lies in insuring micro-, small, and midsize businesses across Europe. With the acquisition of XL, the company is going up against some stiff competition. History has shown AXA can utilize its investment to improve its commercial insurance loss ratio. Only time will tell whether AXA can continue to do so to match market-leading peers in the midmarket and broader commercial segments.","We do not award AXA an economic moat.AXA has returned an average 7.5% return on equity over the last 15 years. The business has earned an average return on equity of 8.9%, excluding unrealized gains and losses, over the same time. Both are below the 11% cost of equity we apply. We forecast AXA will earn a 7.8% and 11.5% return on equity midcycle forecasts.With the sale of AXA Equitable Holdings along with AllianceBernstein, and the purchase of XL Group, AXA has shifted its business model from one that was more focused on life and savings, to one that is more focused on property and casualty. This was a good move, but the change hasn't been all sunshine. Around 20 years ago AXA was looking to grow its insurance portfolio further by leveraging its position in group life insurance in its home market of France to grow market share in SMB insurance. At this time AXAs European property and casualty client mix was around 60% personal and 40% commercial lines. AXAs largest commercial markets were France, the U.K. and Ireland, and Germany.However, we think AXAs economic profits began to go a bit wayward after it moved up the ladder with AXA Corporate Solutions and began to insure larger commercial clients. While AXA Corporate Solutions offered specialty marine, aviation and space, building, infrastructure and construction materials, environmental risks, and energy and transport insurance for larger companies in 90 countries across the globe, and these relationships likely meant returning clients, AXAs commercial insurance loss ratios have been worse than the broader companys property and casualty loss ratios, overall. By AXAs own admission, large accounts were more competitive and less profitable at the higher end.By around 2013 AXA had become the fourth-largest commercial insurer in the world, listed behind Allianz, Zurich, and American Insurance Group yet AXAs commercial insurance book was still largely focused on smaller accounts. Micro businesses accounted for a quarter of property and casualty commercial sales. Another 40% was sold to SMBs and so the lower end of the commercial market still accounted for less than half. Large businesses accounted for 20% of property and casualty commercial insurance sales and corporates accounted for 15%. So, while AXA has ventured into larger and corporate accounts, we think the company was still focused on micro, SMBs and in Europe at least this is where the companys historical expertise lies. AXA has historically liked this part of the market because of the lower penetration and lower levels of competition involved.We think AXA has improved the profitability of its commercial insurance book by investing in technology and improving its process. For example, the company embarks on a yearly portfolio review where it defines growth and profit objectives by segment, and at renewals closely monitors conditions and lines it agrees to write. The company has used a geographical data tool called AEGIS to rule out unprofitable risks and price profitable risks better as well as assist with concentration and accumulation. At least some of these investments have helped contribute to a 3.4-percentage-point improvement in the commercial insurance loss ratio. Benefits might also have been a result of investments in technology that helped improve claims mitigation through claims leakage containment, body shop and supply network management, and fraud detection as part of a technical excellence drive. Nonetheless, AXAs commercial insurance loss ratio has still, at least historically, been 2 percentage points worse than the rest of its property and casualty sales. And more recently AXAs property and casualty combined ratios have worsened.With the acquisition of XL Group in 2018 AXA has done two things: increased its exposure to commercial insurance in North America and increased its exposure to larger commercial insurance accounts. Up until the point of the acquisition AXA generated around EUR 15.8 billion in commercial insurance premiums. The acquisition of XL added EUR 15.9 billion purely commercial insurance premiums, including EUR 4.3 billion of reinsurance and EUR 9.5 billion of specialty premiums. These specialty lines have been predominantly dedicated to marine, aerospace, energy, fine art, London=n wholesale, and political risk. AXAs European midmarket commercial insurance business has historically concentrated on the wholesale and manufacturing sectors. Commercial insurance gross written premiums now account for 30% of gross written premiums across AXA as a whole.AXAs SMB commercial insurance segment has focused on selling insurance to businesses with less than 50 employees. Here it provided basic insurance needs and so, standardization of policy design and wording helped significantly. With the acquisition of XL, it has proportionately increased the amount of commercial insurance it sells to the midmarket where businesses have between 50 and 5,000 employees. We generally like commercial insurance because we think it has a stickier nature than personal lines. Albeit, at least in the case of AXA, commercial insurance is not as profitable as personal lines. We think there are two conflicting elements here and they are that as AXA has moved up the corporate spectrum, it has moved toward writing less profitable accounts. They may become long-term partners, but we think there is also more competition for these accounts. Nonetheless, if written well North American midmarket commercial insurance can be written profitably, with sub-90% combined. But AXA faces a tough time trying to create a maintainable and defendable competitive position here when competing with incumbents.","We assign AXA a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.With the acquisition of XL Group and the encompassing commercial insurance and reinsurance natural catastrophe exposure, AXA introduced more earnings volatility into its portfolio than it wanted to. Since then, the company has taken action to reduce this risk such as reducing the retention limits per risk across the portfolio to EUR 25 million. This means that AXA has moved from a company that had an average natural catastrophe load of around 6 percentage points of net earned premiums to 4 percentage points of net earned premiums over the last few years. This reduced exposure to natural catastrophes is in line with AXAs exit long ago from investments in coal and committing to writing no insurance for the coal industry. This annual natural catastrophe load is equal to around EUR 2 billion.We dont think natural catastrophes are the largest risk to AXAs earnings. Negative market shocks would hit AXAs own funds by EUR 19.5 billion at the end of 2022, and EUR 16.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. A combined market shock of a 100-basis-point fall in interest rates, a 100-basis-point rise in credit spreads, a 100-basis-point rise in euro sovereign bond spreads, a full one-letter credit downgrade, and a 20% fall in equity markets would reduce AXAs adjusted average return on equity to 10.8% and 11.1% respectively. Under this bear-case scenario, our fair value estimate for AXA would be around EUR 26.50.","We award AXA a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating.AXA has a sound balance sheet.At the end of last year, AXAs solvency capital required was EUR 27.2 billion and the company held eligible own funds at the end of the year of EUR 59.1 billion. This meant AXA operated with a 215% solvency capitalization ratio.While AXA has broadly been improving its solvency position during the last 5 years-plus, the sensitivities of its solvency have mainly been deteriorating. AXAs sensitivity to a 100-basis-point fall in interest rates as of the end of last year was 20 percentage points. This isnt the highest that it has been, but the sensitivity to a 100-basis-point fall is still larger than the sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rise. Further, sensitivity to a 100-basis-point expansion in euro sovereign bond spreads has reached negative 18 percentage points. A 20% fall in equity markets would result in a deterioration in AXA's solvency ratio by 10 percentage points. Overall, this means that a combined market shock would hit AXAs own funds by EUR 19.5 billion as of the end of last year. This has dropped as of the end of June to EUR 16.6 billion.AXA has made fair investments.AXA has undertaken a number of smaller corporate actions and two large transactions over recent years.In Asia, we believe AXA has shifted away from developed markets such as Malaysia and Singapore with exits in 2021. However, to counter these withdrawals we think the company has tilted to China with the purchase of half of the Chinese property and casualty insurer Tian Ping Auto Insurance in 2013, which AXA then made whole a few years ago. Meanwhile, AXA has also acquired Philippines insurer Charter Ping An and operations in the Gulf. The merger of AXA and Bharti nonlife insurance into ICICI Lombard in India has confirmed the companys presence in India.In Europe we mainly think AXA has been scaling back and refocusing its operations with an exit from Romania in 2013, an exit from Hungarian banking operations a few years later, and the sale of Serbian operations to Vienna Insurance Group in 2016. Ultimately AXA divested the remainder of its Central and Eastern Europe operations consisting of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia to Uniqa for EUR 1 billion in February 2020. U.K. operations have been rationalized with the sale of investment, pensions, and direct protection business to Phoenix Life, then the sale of its platform wrapper business, and the sale of its commercial property and casualty broker, Bluefin, in 2016. AXA no longer holds banking operations in Belgium, no insurance operations in Portugal or Greece, and sold over EUR 15 billion of closed life and pension reserves in Germany to Athora in 2022.While AXA holds a bancassurance relationship with Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Italy, AXA announced the intended disposal of nearly all of its 100 million shares in February 2023, reducing its stake to less than 10 basis points. AXA acquired Groupe Assurances du Credit Mutuel Espana in Spain in July 2023.While in the Americas AXA has made a smaller Latin America purchase with the acquisition of the property and casualty commercial operations of SulAmerica in May 2015, the large transactions within the group have been here. The 2019 sale of its U.S. long-term savings, life insurance, and third-party asset management businesses, and the purchase of XL, shifted the profile of the group from one that was more heavily weighted to life and savings to one that is more heavily weighted to property and casualty. AXA announced the intended divestment of its U.S. life, savings, health, and asset management businesses in May 2017, and the intended acquisition of XL in March 2018. The divestment included the sale of AXAs 64% shareholding in asset manager Alliance Bernstein.AXA has made appropriate distributions.AXA targets a 55%-65% payout ratio of underlying earnings as an annual dividend. Underlying earnings are net income before the impact of net policyholder participation, deferred acquisition costs, taxes, minority interests, realized gains and losses, and changes in impairments. AXA intends to buy back a little over EUR 1.1 billion of shares this year.","AXAs origins date back to Ancienne Mutuelle, which was one of the few insurers that remained after the creation of the French security system. With the threat of nationalization, a merger took place between three insurance groups The Drouot Group, AXA (still known as Mutuelles Unies in 1982), and Presence Group. Ten years later AXA acquired North American life insurer Equitable Holdings. This was a time of expansion as AXA also bought UAP, a large French insurer at that time. Yet, as markets crashed at the turn of the millennium, AXA decided to refocus its business and exited its stake in U.S. investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. A few years later the firm expanded again with the acquisition of Swiss insurer Winterthur. About 5 years ago AXA began reshaping its portfolio again.","AXA is in sound financial health.AXA has around EUR 13.5 billion of financial debt on its balance sheet. This is made up of EUR 11.8 billion of subordinated debt and EUR 1.7 billion of senior debt. There is no debt due in the near term and most debt has reasonable coupon rates, though some lumps have high interest rates. AXAs debt left the company with a 29.5% debt.equity ratio as of the end of 2022. This is the lowest of our European multilines. We anticipate AXA will maintain this lowest leverage rate.",AXAHY,Financial Services,71367811072.0,PNK,38301.0,USD,30.770000457763672,True,0,29.99317647147647,33.51901216860123,1
25/11/2023,Strong Third Quarter for Santos Sees Guidance Maintained,Santos Ltd,STO,5,19/10/2023,Mark Taylor,7.07,AUD,24/11/2023,12.3,High,,Standard,,19/10/2023,"Our AUD 12.30 fair value estimate for no-moat Santos stands. We see no longer-term implication in Australias second-largest oil and gas producer reporting better-than-expected average third-quarter oil and gas price achievement, only partially offset by marginally lower-than-anticipated production. Third-quarter production rose 2% to 23.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, slightly missing our 24.2 mmboe target. Lower-than-expected gas production from Western Australia more than overshadowed better-than-expected performances from PNG LNG and persisting Bayu-Undan-related Darwin cargoes. Maintenance crimped Varanus Island and Devil Creek facilities in July and August, but group average price achievement increased 2% to USD 58.55 per boe, well ahead of our USD 53.95 forecast. Bayu-Undan keeps on keeping on, with at least one more LNG cargo expected out of Darwin LNG, to be followed by sales into the Australian domestic market until the Bayu-Undan field finally exhausts in the fourth quarter. This and associated high realized prices from Darwin LNG feature in the solid third-quarter price achievement for the group overall. Continued progress on development projects is also pleasing. Work on the Barossa field, which will backfill the Darwin LNG plant in replacement of Bayu-Undan, is now 68% complete. That said, in a sign of the times, Santos along with Woodside, is experiencing some approval delays. Drilling remains suspended pending acceptance of the environmental plan by the regulator. We dont expect a material impact on the timeline, and in a fillip, Santos will begin pipe-laying after meeting updated regulatory requirements. At around AUD 7.85, Santos shares remain undervalued in 4-star territory. Effective delivery of the Barossa project is a key potential catalyst for price appreciation toward fair value. So too is progress is on the Papua LNG project in PNG.","Santos is a beneficiary of continued global economic growth and increased demand for energy. Aside from coal, gas has been the fastest-growing primary energy segment globally. The traded gas segment is expanding faster still.   Santos is in a strong position, with 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent proven and probable reserves, predominantly gas, conveniently located on the doorstep of key Asian markets.  Gas has about half the carbon intensity of coal, and stands to gain market share in the generation segment and elsewhere as carbon taxes are rolled out. ","Santos committed to substantial LNG capital expenditures, which will see the balance sheet geared in the medium term.  Much of the company's perceived value is in coal seam gas to LNG projects that are yet to reach full capacity.  Landholder opposition to coal seam gas development could hinder production growth. ",19/10/2023,"Santos is the second-largest Australian pure oil and gas exploration and production company (behind Woodside Petroleum, ASX:WPL), with interests in all Australian hydrocarbon provinces, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Well-timed East Australian coal seam gas purchases and subsequent partial sell-downs bolstered the balance sheet and set the scene for liquid natural gas, or LNG, exports. Santos is now one of Australia's largest coal seam gas producers and continues to prove additional reserves. It is the country's largest domestic gas supplier.  Coal seam gas purchases increased reserves, and partial sell-downs generated cash profits, putting Santos on solid ground to improve performance. Group proven and probable, or 2P, reserves doubled to 1,400 mmboe, primarily East Australian coal seam gas. Coal seam gas has grown to represent more than 40% of group 2P reserves, despite partial equity sell-downs.  A degree of confidence can be drawn from project partners. U.S. energy supermajor ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company, is 42% owner and the operator of the PNG LNG project. The Gladstone LNG project was built and is operated by GLNG Operations, a joint venture of owners Santos (30%), Petronas (27.5%), Total (27.5%), and Kogas (15%). Petronas is Malaysia's national oil and gas company and the world's second-largest LNG exporter. French energy major Total is the world's fifth-largest publicly traded oil and gas company, and Korea's Kogas is the world's largest buyer of LNG. Santos is in good company.  Overall, we see a happier future for Santos now that excess debt levels are addressed, aided via improved margins and earnings driven by Gladstone and PNG LNG. The company increasingly enjoys export pricing on its gas. In addition to Santos' Gladstone LNG, several other third-party east-coast LNG projects conspire to drive domestic gas prices higher. As the largest domestic gas supplier, Santos can expect significant bang for its buck, with limited additional capital or operating cost required to capture enhanced prices. The group production profile is simplified with increased certainty in project life.","Given a lower energy price paradigm, we don't expect Santos to generate returns sufficiently in excess of its cost of capital, meaning that it has no moat. LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Gladstone will see Santos generate improved returns based on our long-term oil price of USD 60 per barrel. Santos has 20-year contracts that tie the gas price to the oil price--USD 60 per barrel equates to USD 8.40 per gigajoule. However, returns will now be insufficient to support a moat. Returns on invested capital, or ROICs, have been in the single digits and below the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, since the mid-2000s. Santos suffered industry cost inflation without the benefit of higher international pricing because of a heavy weight of domestic gas contracts. In addition, the construction phase of Gladstone and Papua New Guinea LNG projects further crimped returns precommissioning. We expect the trend to improve with ramp-up from Gladstone LNG and domestic gas contracts rolling off. With the USD 60 per barrel midcycle Brent oil price, however, we expect ROICs to only marginally exceed the cost of capital. Less-than-stellar returns are driven by PNG LNG and Gladstone being constructed at Australian energy boom inflated capital cost, permanently bloating the invested capital base and detracting from returns. If expansion LNG trains are built at Gladstone, returns could be expected to improve after 2024. Santos can expand its Gladstone LNG project from two trains to four, which would allow it to drive greater capital efficiency on the two-train startup configuration. Current infrastructure, such as pipelines and wharfage, is sufficient for the expansion, and no further expensive dredging would be required. However, we don't credit expansion in the number of trains, given the likelihood that the LNG market will be in a state of excess supply for at least the near term. Furthermore, it is not clear that expansion would sufficiently correct for the inflated expenditure of the past, to drive returns sufficiently in excess of WACC. Deflating industry capital costs will also benefit competitors yet to enter the market. Santos is Australia's largest domestic gas supplier, only cemented with the August 2018 USD 2.15 billion purchase of Quadrant Energy. Profitability will improve with the higher domestic gas price. With the advent of LNG exports in Eastern Australia, the domestic gas market has become more attractive, with contract prices being written near AUD 8 per gigajoule, versus historical contracts near AUD 4 per gigajoule. Group average domestic gas price achievement was AUD 5.00 per gigajoule in 2018. Our long-term Australian domestic gas price assumption is AUD 7.00 per gigajoule in 2022 dollars. In this space, Santos is largely owner-operator of assets, with little additional capital required to take advantage of the higher domestic gas prices. Competitive advantage is from efficient scale, particularly at the important Moomba hub, where it makes no sense for a competitor to replicate infrastructure. But again, Santos' domestic businesses comprises less than a third of our fair value estimate, which is insufficiently material to offset no-moat attributes in LNG. We dont expect Santos economic moat potential to be undermined by material shareholder value destruction from environmental, social and governance, or ESG, risks. ESG risks are based largely on industry risks that are already incorporated into our base-case analysis. And natural gas is the predominant value driver for Australian E&Ps like Santos. Natural gas is less carbon-intensive than coal or oil, and stands to benefit from efforts to minimize emissions, at least in the medium term. This is because renewables like wind and solar, while growing rapidly, cant hope to entirely meet global energy requirements for decades, if ever. Hydrocarbons share of primary energy consumption fell to 84% from 87% over the last decade, though in absolute terms consumption increased by 74 exajoules or 15% to 492 exajoules. Share was displaced by renewables which increased to 5% of total from 2%, or by 21 exajoules to 29 exajoules. Note in absolute terms, growth from hydrocarbons was more than triple that for renewables. And gas played the lead role, consumption increasing by 36 exajoules or 34%. We expect the trend for gas in particular to continue at least in the medium term, as the most effective way to quickly reduce emissions meaningfully. Gas share of primary energy consumption increased to 24% from 22% over the last 10 years.Further, E&Ps are doing more to defray emissions from their extraction operations. Santos plans 26%-30% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2040. It also has the Moomba CCS project that proposes to store 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Another element of ESG risk for E&Ps includes potential loss of field access due to poor community relations. Santos too has courted community unrest at Narrabri in New South Wales. The coal seam gas project was ultimately given the green light from the NSW Independent Planning Commission in 2020, but not before a large number of concerns from farmers around potential effects on groundwater were aired. Only time will tell as to what scale the project achieves. Regardless, we dont view it as overly material for the company, its Queensland coal seam gas leases far more important and enjoying greater public and political support.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Santos is High, with moderate debt levels in support of an 11.0% cost of equity. High enterprise risk reflects commodity price volatility. To put the rating in perspective, we rate all Australian resource and energy exposures as being at least high-risk, including BHP Billiton, despite its greater commodity and geographical diversification, along with its increased scale advantages. Santos faces environmental and operational risks, which are a given with the oil and gas industry, as well as country-specific risks associated with some of its non-Australian assets. It is also a comparatively small player in a world of oil and gas supermajors.Material ESG exposures create additional risk for E&P investors. In this industry, the most significant exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (both from extraction operations and downstream consumption), and other emissions, effluents, and waste (primarily oil spills). In addition to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as fracking bans, drilling permit suspensions, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions, already in place in some jurisdictions.These ESG risks are based largely on industry risks that are already incorporated into our base-case analysis. And natural gas is the predominant value driver for Australian E&Ps like Santos. Natural gas is less carbon-intensive than coal or oil, and stands to benefit from efforts to minimize emissions, at least in the medium term. This is because renewables like wind and solar, while growing rapidly, cant hope to entirely meet global energy requirements for decades, if ever.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Santos is Standard.Santos balance sheet is sound. Moderate leverage (ND/E) of 21% and maintenance of strong net operating cash flow is reassuring. Santos debt covenants have adequate headroom and are not under threat even at low oil prices. The weighted average term to maturity is around 5.5 years, with less than 23% due by 2023. Strong net operating cash flow of USD 1.4 billion in first-half 2023 facilitated net debt climbing only modestly from December 2022 levels to USD 3.1 billion. Thats despite more than USD 1.0 billion of capital expenditure and USD 330 million spent on buybacks. Gearing is just 21% well within Santos 15%-25% target rangeand net debt/EBITDA is only 0.75. We expect gearing to remain at conservative sub-40% levels despite capital expenditure on expansion projects and ongoing buybacks.On the investment side, we rate Santos performance as fair. The company let itself down on the capital-allocation side due to cost overruns associated with building the USD 18.5 billion Gladstone LNG project. Returns consequently worsened to low-single digits over the past eight years, well below its cost of capital. Some of this is due to Gladstone being built with expansion in mind, and any future growth will be somewhat more capital-efficient than for the current two LNG trains. Santos could probably expand to three trains, subject to securing natural gas feed and LNG offtake, with cost savings coming on the capital side from better utilization of existing tankage, wharfage, and surrounding infrastructure.We project Santos returns on invested capital could exceed our assessed 9.7% weighted average cost of capital by as soon as 2025. However, this reflects the Barossa to Darwin LNG project, and then the likely prolific Dorado oil project, coming on-line, rather than Gladstone. Our base case does not now canvass Gladstone expansion. We project cumulative capital expenditure of USD 4.0 billion, beginning 2022 on the Dorado oil project and the Barossa to Darwin LNG upgrade. But this is excellent near-term bang-for-buck expenditure, increasing group production by 40% to 160mmboe by 2026. Capital-efficient development and fast up-front cash flows from Dorados oil should combine to ensure Santos leverage ratios continue to decline from current levels despite outgoings.Finally, we think distributions are somewhat low resulting in a mixed rating. Santos recommenced dividends in 2018 following a three-year hiatus due to elevated debt levels on the back of Gladstone expenditures. The payout ratio has been a comparatively conservative 30%. Santos' updated policy is to pay out at least 40% of free cash flow. We assume 50% is paid out going forward, including half as dividend and half as buybacks. While conservatism was advised while Santos restruck its operating model to achieve a maintainable USD 25 per barrel free cash flow breakeven oil price business, we think a higher dividend payout is now warranted, rewarding long suffering shareholders without risking the now much stronger balance sheet. ","Santos was founded in 1954. The company's name is an acronym for South Australia Northern Territory Oil Search. The first Cooper Basin gas discovery came in 1963, with initial supplies in 1969. Santos became a major enterprise, though over-reliance on the Cooper Basin, along with the Moomba field's inexorable decline, saw it struggle to maintain relevance in the first decade of the 21st century. However, the stage was set for a renaissance via conversion of coal seam gas into LNG in Queensland and conventional gas to LNG in PNG.","Strong first-half net operating cash flow of USD 1.4 billion in first-half 2023 facilitated net debt climbing only modestly from December 2022 levels to USD 3.1 billion. Thats despite more than USD 1.0 billion of capital expenditure and USD 330 million spent on buybacks. Gearing is just 21%within Santos 15%-25% target rangeand net debt/EBITDA is only 0.75. We expect gearing to remain at conservative sub-40% levels despite capital expenditure on expansion projects and ongoing buybacks. Santos debt covenants have adequate headroom and are not under threat at current oil prices. The weighted average term to maturity is around 5.5 years. With expansionary capital expenditure, and softening earnings, we anticipate net debt/EBITDA to rise but only to a peak of 1.6 in 2025which is still moderateand to fall back to 1.0 by 2027, all else being equal. Major project capital expenditure is slated to significantly decrease in 2026 as Barossa LNG and Pikka Phase 1 are delivered. Santos is also in advanced discussions with short-listed parties for a 5% selldown of its current 43% PNG LNG equity stake, which would improve the balance sheet even further. We are supportive if the price is right.We project capital expenditure of USD 12.6 billion, beginning 2022 to 2027, including on the PNG LNG and Papua LNG expansions, the Barossa to Darwin LNG upgrade and Pikka oil. But this is excellent bang-for-buck expenditure, increasing group production by 40% to 160 mmboe by 2027. Capital efficient development and fast up-front cash flows from Pikkas oil should combine to ensure Santos leverage ratios continue to decline from current levels despite outgoings.",STO.AX,Energy,22149791744.0,ASX,8508008.0,AUD,7.0,True,1,7.356354198235635,7.194415679791463,1
25/11/2023,China Feihe To Digitalize Its Channel in Response to the Tougher Operating Environment,China Feihe Ltd,06186,4,29/08/2023,Jacky Tsang,4.74,HKD,24/11/2023,6.4,High,Narrow,Standard,,29/08/2023,"Wide-moat Inner Mongolia Yili and narrow-moat China Feihe posted interim results that were broadly in line with our estimates. Sales growth for both was hurt by soft demand in the infant milk formula, or IMF, sector, due to low birthrates and inventory clearance of products under the old national standards. This is consistent with earlier results revealed by a2 Milk Company. Yili and Feihe management teams are optimistic about the second-half trend. Feihe said its excess inventory was mostly cleared in the first half, while Yili updated its full-year top-line and net margin guidance to mid-single-digit growth and 30 basis points of improvement, respectively. Top-line guidance is consistent with our estimates, but we continue to see difficulty in reaching the guided margin. We retain our fair value estimates, which imply 25 times 2023 price/earnings for Yili and 12 times for Feihe. Both shares are undervalued versus our fair values. Feihes stock reacted positively after management laid out the plan to digitalize its distribution and pledged to increase its dividend payout ratio in the next few years. We think Yilis share price could continue to be suppressed in the near term as the growth outlook for liquid milk demand remains uncertain amid soft consumer sentiment. Plus, we have yet to see any material moves by the company to reignite demand.","Feihe had early mover advantage in the infant milk formula market in China, which gives the company an advantage in distribution that would take a long time for new entrants to replicate.  Given its leadership in the IMF segment, Feihe could expand its coverage to other baby food categories, thereby lifting its medium-term growth outlook.  Feihe has retained a quality brand image among Chinese consumers on IMF products, which the company could leverage to refresh its portfolio with innovative offerings and maintain its profit margin. ","Any potential mishap in Feihes product quality would be a heavy blow to its brand reputation and sales, with potentially long-lasting adverse impact.  Leading domestic brands are eyeing share gain in the IMF market in China, with increasingly competitive offerings at a lower price than Feihe.  Any rebound in birthrate could be muted in China even after the COVID-19 pandemic, adding pressure to the growth outlook for Feihes addressable market. ",29/08/2023,"Feihe strives to be a topnotch domestic infant milk formula, or IMF, producer in China. It has been able to price its products at a premium comparable with imported products, and is marketed as tailored for Chinese babies. The company has invested considerably in building out its sales network in maternity stores across China, as the category is mainly sold through this channel. Feihe possesses a scalable distributing and retail outlet network in the country. With years of investment in research and development as well as an excellent track record in product quality, Feihe has established a reliable brand image that is trusted by Chinese consumers alongside multinational IMF brands. It became the number one brand in value terms in China in 2019, according to Euromonitor, and has since maintained its leadership position. Feihe increased its value share considerably in recent years, thanks to the success of its super-premium Astrobaby product series. As the new national standard on IMF completed implementation in early 2023, we think the share of domestic IMF brands will continue to grow in China. Feihe may face price competition from leading IMF players that look to ramp up market share, but we think serious competition remains limited and the company should be able to continue commanding a price premium over most domestic brands. Its ability to invest in research, sales and marketing will continue to be an entry barrier for smaller players. In our view, the gap between domestic and imported brands of both price and consumer confidence is set to narrow further, which we think is beneficial to Feihe.  We also think Feihe will expand into other baby food categories in the long term through acquisitions, thanks to its abundant cash reserve. Multinational brands in European and Asian developed markets also cover a wide range of infant food categories aside from IMF. We believe this is a sensible direction to fuel the companys long-term growth. ","We assign a narrow moat rating to Feihe based on the intangible assets it possesses. We think the companys moat source stems from its premium pricing power as well as entrenched retailer relationships in Chinas infant milk formula market. IMF is a category where product safety is a high priority in purchase decisions. This is especially so since 2008, when the IMFs of several renowned domestic companies in China were discovered to contain melamine and caused medical conditions for close to 300,000 infants. Consumers, therefore, preferred foreign IMF brands instead of domestic offerings for a time, despite the formers price premium. In 2013, according to Euromonitor, only two out of the top five IMF companies in China were domestic producers, with Nestle, Danone and Mead Johnson occupying the top three value share positions. Feihe was among the few leading domestic IMF companies that passed authorities quality checks during the melamine incident. As a result, the quality of its products was gradually recognized by Chinese consumers and end-retailers where retail shelf space could be secured alongside leading international brands. But its worth noting that the IMF market in China, compared with developed markets, is more fragmented. The top three IMF companies together held less than 50% of value share in 2022, according to Euromonitor, whereas in the U.S. and Japan, the figure was above 77%. As a result, we think Feihe has not demonstrated sufficient history in its leadership position that is comparable with multinational IMF companies such as Danone, the latter warranting a wide moat for its nutrition business.Euromonitors data shows Feihes value share in the milk formula market in China increased to 20.4% in 2022 from 4.4% in 2013. The company has invested both in its products and channel distribution, which drove share gain and generated excess return. We think Feihe has successfully bolstered consumers confidence in its IMF offerings through years of investments in research and development, with top priority placed on product safety. Furthermore, the company has monetized its brand recognition through pricing at a premium versus other domestic offerings. The companys market share has been increasing over the past decade despite competition from foreign peers with longer brand histories. Feihe has endeavored to enhance its R&D capabilities since the early 2010s. It engaged in the research of OPO (sn-2 palmitate), a triglyceride that is similar in structure to human milk fat, together with a provincial-level Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2010 and collaborated with Harvard Medical School in 2014 for laboratory studies in nutrition research. Moreover, Feihe is the only IMF company that participated in the National 863 program, a Chinese government-funded program for research and development of advanced technologies. In 2022, the company was granted the first manufacturing permit of lactoferrin in China, which is a key ingredient in IMF that relies predominantly on imports. Being a domestic IMF brand, Feihe has also developed products that closely resemble breast milk of Chinese mothers. The company has established a Chinese breast milk database to study nutritional composition, which serves as reference for the development of its IMF products, thereby appealing to consumers as the IMF that is designed for Chinese babies. We think this track record of R&D in infant nutrition and IMF ingredients has strengthened Feihes position as a reliable domestic IMF producer that differentiates itself from imported products and has created a barrier that small players cant replicate due to limited resources. The company also has stringent quality assurance procedures for its IMF production process, with a team of close to 300 staff specifically dedicated to product quality control. These investments have assured the confidence of new customers and bolstered Feihes leadership in the industry, in our view. Euromonitor records the average price per kilogram of IMF as increasing to CNY 269 in 2021 from CNY 223 in 2016. The 4% CAGR is around double the inflation rate during the period, which suggests mix was also a driver. Imported IMF commanded a roughly 20% price premium over domestic offerings, based on data from the Ministry of Commerce. The premium reached 40% in the late 2000s, when the melamine incident occurred. IMF manufacturers can charge a premium if they successfully create a perception among consumers of superior product quality. The average household size in China has declined to 2.62 in 2020 from 3.1 in 2010, based on National Bureau of Statistics data. According to an iResearch study in 2021, Chinese mothers placed quality and safety over price when making purchase decisions for their children. More than half of the surveyed parents increased their spending on child-rearing versus the year before. We believe parents in China are increasingly willing to spend on premium infant products, with the lower number of children per household. The National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China also highlighted in April that Chinese families are having fewer children and being more selective about the circumstances for starting a family. It follows then that IMF companies would look to mix to drive revenue growth. Feihe, in our view, has successfully positioned itself as a premium IMF brand, and has contributed to the rising average selling prices of the IMF sector in China. The companys flagship super-premium lineup, Astrobaby (with price per kg of over CNY 400), has started to gain traction since 2016, driving the sales mix of Feihes super-premium segment to close to 60% in 2022, from 22% in 2016. The companys gross margin also rose to 66% from 56% during the same period. We think this demonstrates consumers confidence in its products, similar to the rationale behind the higher prices of imported IMF over domestic counterparts. While this consumer behavior has been most evident following the melamine incident in 2008, we think product quality continues to guide consumer preferences. As a result, the company was able to generate a higher-than-peer net margin of over 20% in 2022. Feihes operating margin is also higher than that of the IMF segments of Nestle and Danone (on recurring basis).Maternity stores are a major distribution channel for IMF, given their more specialized nature in selling infant-related products. IMF producers look to obtain retail shelf space in maternity stores with the goal of bolstering professional brand image. Maternity stores also look to stockpile popular IMF brands that could attract foot traffic and drive sales of other products in the store. According to Frost & Sullivan, maternity stores account for around half of IMF sales value in China. Feihe has positioned itself early in this channel and such a move has helped the premiumization of its product portfolio in recent years. Its major competitor, Yili, has only started switching its focus from the key accounts channel to maternity stores in recent years. Feihe reaches these retail outlets either through its distributor partners or direct sales, with a distributor network of over 2,700 and retail point-of-sale coverage of close to 100,000. With a single-layer distribution system, the company could increase its visibility of end-demand dynamics and respond to consumer feedback in a more timely manner. Feihes scale also allows the company to aggressively spend on offline marketing activities that are specific to IMF or infant productsthese are difficult to be replicated by small players without such financial and human resources. Feihes sales and marketing expenses ratio reached 30% on average, materially higher than that of other food and beverage companies. Apart from typical channel fees, the firm organizes offline seminars, recreational booths and small carnivals, targeting parents and children, inside large-scale maternity stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets. These events are intended to attract new customers through product education and building brand awareness. The retail outlets would typically favor large brands like Feihe, as the latter could better attract foot traffic to the formers outlets and drive spending in store. Parents are typically attracted to these free events as a leisure family activity and would be targeted by Feihes sales personnel as potential customers. Feihe organized over 1,000,000 of these events in 2021 and acquired over 2 million new customers. The number of events held by the second-largest IMF player in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic hit China, was only one tenth of Feihes. The sheer scale of these offline marketing activities is difficult for small players to match, due to the resources required. Retailers are also inclined to partner with renowned brands to ensure popularity of these events. We think Feihes abundant marketing budget has ensured it can maintain a solid customer acquisition channel and relationship with end-retailers. We do not think Feihe demonstrates strong evidence of cost advantage, as its higher margin over peers is mainly a result of premium pricing. Feihe acquired a 71% stake in YuanShengTai Dairy Farm, one of the major dairy farming companies in China, with farms located in major raw milk production province Heilongjiang. Together with Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Hebei and Shandong, these provinces are situated roughly between 40 and 50 degrees north in latitude, where weather and plantation are suitable for cattle rearing. Feihe sources close to 90% of its raw milk from YuanShengTai and the latter has an average annual milk yield per cow of 11.2 metric tons (above the industry average of 8-9 metric tons). We think the higher efficiency of YuanShengTai over small dairy farmers confers some sort of cost advantage to Feihe, through which earnings from the former could flow to the latter. However, both parties transact raw milk mostly at market prices. More importantly, the ownership of dairy farms ensures the quality of raw milk used in Feihes IMFs, as the melamine incident in late 2000 was due to subpar raw milk procured from outsourced dairy farmers. Other major IMF producers like Inner Mongolia Yili and JunLeBao Dairy also own dairy farms for raw milk supply.","Based on the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system, we believe a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is appropriate. Feihes cash flow is susceptible to a few major risks, namely the demographics trend in China and product safety. The companys sales hinge on the number of new births in China, which have been declining since 2016 despite increasingly favorable government policies to boost birthrates. The growth in addressable market for Feihe in the medium to long term remains uncertain, as changing mindsets on family size in China could have more lasting impacts on future birthrates. As Feihes products are consumed by infants, consumers are particularly sensitive to product quality and safety. Any minor defects detected in its products could have huge adverse effects on sales and brand image that are difficult to reverse. We note that Sanlu, the company that was discovered to have the most severe quality issue in the melamine scandal in 2008, went bankrupt afterward. But we think Feihe has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in upholding quality control for its IMFs. It has a team of over 300 people involved in quality control from raw milk, manufacturing, and packaging, to after-sales management. Subpar quality in raw milk from outsourced dairy farmers was the major reason for the melamine incident in 2008. Feihe passed all checks by authorities on its raw milk during that period and has continued to implement stringent control procedures for this major input material. It sources most of the raw milk from its subsidiary, YuanShengTai, and its requirements as to aerobic plate and somatic cell counts in raw milk are stricter than the standards required by regulatory bodies in China and Europe. As the market leader, we think Feihe has the means and resources required to uphold product safety, which is also the key environmental, social, and governance risk facing the firm. ","We rate Feihes capital allocation as Standard, mainly driven by our assessment of fair investment decisions made by the company.We think Feihe has invested appropriately in building its competitive advantage in IMF product quality, which is of utmost importance in Chinese consumers decisionmaking following the melamine incident. Its R&D investments were successful in translating into premium pricing that generated excess return for the company, as Chinese consumers were willing to pay more in exchange for product safety. Feihe was able to gain share amid the perceived better quality of imported brands and reached the number one value share position in recent years. Feihe has also invested sufficiently in customer acquisition through large-scale offline activities and penetration into maternity stores, the latter being the key retail channel for IMF products. We believe the company would continue to devote appropriate resources to maintain its leadership and premium position in the market. However, we anticipate the market to become more competitive, as more domestic leading players are gaining momentum and winning consumers trust.We consider Feihes balance sheet risk as low, considering its sufficient cash reserve and net cash position. To lift medium-term top-line and profit growth, we think the company would evaluate acquisition opportunities. We conceive that brands in the infant food sector could be a viable direction, as Feihe could leverage its brand image in the infant food universe. The company has had an average dividend payout ratio of around 40% since 2019, and is willing to increase dividend per share over the next couple of years. We expect the company to increase its payout ratio to 50% over the next five years, as Feihe sits on abundant cash and takes a more cautious approach to acquisitions.","Feihe is the number one infant milk formula company in China, with a premium market positioning among domestic and foreign competing brands. The company utilizes the flagship Astrobaby lineup to promote its more suitable for Chinese babies proposition. It has a nationwide distributor network covering maternity stores, supermarkets and traditional retailers, as well as a direct sales network in e-commerce.","We think Feihe is in sound financial shape, supported by sufficient cash reserve and operating cash flow. The company has a low debt/equity ratio and is in a net cash position. Its interest coverage ratio is above peer average. We expect these metrics to remain broadly stable over the next five years. We forecast the company to generate between CNY 5 billion and CNY 6 billion in operating cash flow annually, which should be sufficient for capital investment and a dividend payout ratio of around 50%. The company holds close to CNY 10 billion in cash, which increased notably following its IPO in 2019. This provides a strong reserve for any potential acquisition opportunities. Referencing overseas brands like Nestle and Wakodo, we think it makes sense for Feihe to expand into other infant food categories as a medium- to long-term growth strategy. We think the company could be considering acquisitions of existing brands in this sector where its channel sales network could be leveraged.",6186.HK,Consumer Defensive,39895900160.0,HKG,10373750.0,HKD,4.840000152587891,True,1,4.59715670850241,3.9519753073407413,0
24/11/2023,Novozymes Is the Dominant Leader in the Global Enzymes Industry,Novozymes A/S,NZYM B,4,26/10/2023,Rob Hales,363.3,DKK,24/11/2023,395.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,26/10/2023,"Wide-moat Novozymes reported third-quarter EBIT before special items of DKK 1.2 billion, down 10% versus 2022 but 6% ahead of consensus. The EBIT margin, at 26.6%, marked a sequential improvement compared with the 24% reported in the second quarter and was 130 basis points ahead of consensus. Organic sales growth was 8% (compared with 6% in the consensus), driven by a 3% growth in volume. This growth was supported by the gradual reduction in destocking in the food-related sectors and increasing demand for sustainable biosolutions. With results beating consensus for both organic growth and EBIT margin, the share price was up 6% intraday at the time of writing. The guidance for 2023 remains unchanged, however, with organic growth anticipated to be in the range of 4% to 6%, primarily driven by pricing. As the fourth quarter progresses, management anticipates further stabilization in destocking activities within the food-related sectors. We confirm our DKK 395 fair value estimate. At current levels, the shares look undervalued. Within the segments, organic sales growth was 6%, 7%, 21%, negative 3%, and 6% for household care; food, beverages, and human health; bioenergy; grain and tech processing; and agriculture, animal health, and nutrition, respectively. Consensus estimates were broadly off across the board, except for food, beverages, and human health, with destocking gradually leveling off. Full-year organic sales growth expectations for the segments were maintained compared with the second quarter except for bioenergy and grain and tech processing, which were raised. Organic sales growth for 2023 is expected to be in the low single digits for household care and for food, beverages, and human health; 20% (midteens previously) for bioenergy; high single digits (previously low single digits) for grain and tech processing; and mid to high single digits for agriculture, animal health, and nutrition. ",Novozymes' new freshness and hygiene platform should reinvigorate growth in the household-care business.  The rollout of the new corn inoculant should drive double-digit growth in the agriculture business for several years. The company uses its free cash flow for shareholder-friendly initiatives like share buybacks and rising dividend payments.,"Novozymes expects a large amount of synergies with its acquisition of Chr. Hansen, which increases execution risks around the integration. Innovation has been elusive for the company in baking enzymes, one of its larger businesses. The outlook for the U.S. bioenergy business is hard to predict, given the current volatility in energy markets.  ",04/01/2023,"Novozymes is the global leader in industrial enzymes, which are essentially biological catalysts. Its enzymes allow customers to achieve greater yields, better performance, or lower costs in their products and production processes, primarily by reducing raw material and energy requirements. With near-50% market share, Novozymes is the dominant leader in a consolidated market. The only other major player is DuPont, with 20% share. Key end markets for Novozymes products are laundry detergents, ethanol fuel production, food and beverages, and animal feed. Agriculture is a relatively new market for Novozymes, as the technology is largely based on micro-organisms rather than enzymes. The companys expertise was developed through acquisition of several small companies, and in 2013, it formed a partnership with Monsanto called the BioAg Alliance. While recent performance has been dampened by low crop prices and reduced farmer incomes, we expect bioagriculture to be a key growth platform in the future. The company's business model is most effective in an environment of high energy and raw material costs, as this is when its yield-enhancing and input-reducing solutions are more valuable to its customers. With the lower oil- and crop-price environment of recent years, organic sales growth has tumbled from high-single-digit levels to a low single digits. We expect crop prices to recover over time, but a return to an environment of $100/barrel oil looks doubtful. Consequently, we think mid-single-digit organic sales growth is realistic over the medium term.  Research and development is critical to Novozymes success, and its expenses in this area dwarf competition. As the macroeconomic environment will likely provide less of a tailwind in the future, the companys growth will be even more dependent on innovation. We think prospects are good for the new hygiene platform in household care and the corn inoculant in agriculture. Further, the company is quickly gaining market share in the yeast market with its recent product launches. ","We think Novozymes has a wide moat based on intangible assets and switching costs. The company has a dominant position in the concentrated industrial enzymes industry, with near-50% market share. In its largest business, laundry detergents, Novozymes controls almost 70% of the market. Competition is relatively benign due to the industrys duopolistic nature. DuPont is the number-two player with 20% market share, while DSM is a distant third with 5%-6% market share and is largely confined to the food and beverage segment. Historically, Novozymes returns on invested capital have been in the 15%-20% range, while operating margins have steadily crept higher. We expect the firm to maintain ROICs in the midteens.Intangible assets for Novozymes comprise know-how and patents. The companys research and development capability is unmatched in the industry. It has decades of experience in fermentation technology, which forms the basis of its proprietary knowledge. This can be traced to its Danish heritage. Denmark is the centre for fermentation technology, as seen with other highly successful Danish companies focused on fermentation applications, such as Christian Hansen and Novo Nordisk. In fact, DuPonts path to number-two status in the industry was achieved through acquisition of Danish enzyme company Danisco.The company owns two thirds of the industrys patents, currently amounting to some 7,000. This was achieved through annual research and development expenses that consistently represent 13%-14% of sales. Indeed, Novozymes investment in R&D accounts for two thirds of the total industry spend. Consequently, most of Novozymes sales are covered by patents. Novozymes is the clear leader in high-performance enzymes, particularly those designed for yield enhancements. We think there are essentially no substitutes for Novozymes premium enzymes--alternative products would require the sacrificing of performance. While DuPont is a major industry player, we think it lags Novozymes significantly in terms of technology. For example, Novozymes has seven different classes of enzymes targeting the laundry detergent market, while DuPont has just two. We think Novozymes also benefits from switching costs, as its enzymes provide the critical performance attributes in customer products or become an integral part of the customers production process. With the broadest portfolio of enzyme products, many customers use Novozymes as their sole supplier of industrial enzymes. The company works closely with its customers R&D teams to develop tailored solutions to meet desired performance characteristics. This is particularly important in laundry detergents, where unique performance attributes are used as the basis for marketing claims and to establish brand differentiation. For the more process-oriented customers, such as ethanol producers, Novozymes provides a high level of technical service to ensure plants are optimised, guaranteeing enzyme effectiveness. Once plants are optimised to run with Novozymes products, minimising disruption in the production process is typically more important than achieving incremental cost savings. Some industries, particularly food and beverage, are wary of switching suppliers due to significant regulatory obligations and the high cost of failure. Customers dont want to risk the quality and safety of their products by switching to an unknown or untrusted supplier.","Novozymes has a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The company has a good balance of end markets, with several in less cyclical areas such as household products, food and beverage, and animal feed. However, Novozymes is exposed to fluctuations in energy prices and raw material prices. Novozymes business model works best in an environment of high energy and raw material prices, as customers value the yield-enhancing effects of its enzymes more in this scenario. The bioenergy segment is dependent on a healthy market for ethanol production in the U.S. Consequently, regulation is a key determinant in this area, creating additional risk. Novozymes spends a large amount on R&D, which forms the foundation of its economic moat. Competition from jurisdictions where it cannot protect its intellectual property may damage its competitive advantage. As a Danish company reporting in Danish kroner with global operations, the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk, particularly from the euro and U.S. dollar.Like most chemical firms, Novozymes environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks are mainly related to production, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions of wastewater and air pollutants. Regulatory changes could increase operating costs, require capital investments to meet new standards, or increase liability risks. Previously undiscovered soil and ground water contamination on operating sites could lead to material fines or other penalties in the future. Novozymes bioenergy business is dependent on political mandates for ethanol blending in fuel. A reversal in sentiment could be a material negative event, but we think the probability is low. The company is heavily dependent on innovation and a large workforce of skilled research and development personnel. Poor management of human capital resulting in an inability to attract and retain talent could impede its ability to compete and maintain its market leadership. ","Novozymes has a Standard capital allocation rating. The balance sheet is sound. We see business risk as medium while debt levels are low with balanced maturities. We view investments as fair. Novozymes has historically driven growth organically, primarily through R&D investment, and this strategy has proven to be effective. However, in recent years, R&D productivity has declined, which has resulted in a declining ROIC including capitalized R&D expenses. A few large projects, specifically second-generation ethanol and enzymes targeting the pharmaceutical industry, did not pan out. We think concrete steps are being taken to remedy this problem and expect ROIC to reverse its downward trend in coming years. Acquisitions have historically been small bolt-on acquisitions with limited financial metrics disclosed. Notably, the micro-organism business was developed through a series of small acquisitions and now represents the core agriculture business. As this segment is poised to be a major growth driver in coming years, we think these acquisitions were a wise use of capital.We think shareholder distributions are appropriate. Novozymes generates a lot of free cash flow and maintains a consistent balance between organic investments, dividends, and share buybacks. However, Novozymes often trades at a premium to fair value, which leads us to believe share repurchases are modestly dilutive, on average.Novozymes has a dual-class shareholder structure that allows Novo, which holds 26% of common stock, to effectively control 71% of voting rights. ","Novozymes is the world leader in industrial enzymes. In recent years, the company has expanded into micro-organisms, primarily for agricultural markets. The firm supplies five major industry groups: household care, food and beverages, bioenergy, agriculture and feed, and technical and pharma. Its biological solutions create value for its customers by improving yield efficiency and performance, while saving energy and generating less waste. The company is headquartered in Denmark.","Novozymes is in excellent financial health. Our model-driven credit risk assessment is very low. Novozymes ended 2020 with net debt of DKK 3.8 billion. Net debt/EBITDA was 0.8 times in 2020, within the company's 0-1 times target. Novozymes has also returned value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. For 2020, the proposed dividend was DKK 5.25, flat versus the previous year and equivalent to a 52% payout ratio. We expect the firm will continue to reward shareholders with a steadily growing dividend and regular share buybacks. In 2018, the company increased the long-term dividend payout ratio to 50%. In 2020, around DKK 1.5 billion in shares were repurchased and the share-buyback program was renewed in 2021 for up to DKK 1.5 billion.",0Q4U.IL,Basic Materials,98787418112.0,IOB,950.0,DKK,366.7000122070313,True,1,309.6164174634314,372.23915633236146,0
24/11/2023,Keysights Broad and Deep Communications Portfolio Offers Good Growth and a Wide Moat,Keysight Technologies Inc,KEYS,4,21/11/2023,William Kerwin,135.72,USD,23/11/2023,166.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,21/11/2023,"We modestly trim our fair value estimate for shares of wide-moat Keysight Technologies to $166, from $170, to reflect lowered expectations for fiscal 2024. We reiterate our confidence in Keysight for the long term, and its ability to rebound from current soft end-market demand. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Keysight saw a continuation of the weak spending environment for telecom customers that has hamstrung orders across fiscal 2023. The firm is now encountering additional weakness out of its consumer and semiconductor end markets, particularly in China, which leads us to taper our short-term forecasts. We now expect a low-single-digit sales decline in fiscal 2024, driven entirely by weaker end markets. We continue to forecast an inflection back to healthy growth for the firm in fiscal 2025 and forecast longer-term growth driven by wireless network, broadband, and data center buildouts and supplemented by artificial intelligence. We believe Keysight will gain share in communications testing with unmatched portfolio breadth and depth, which also underpins its wide moat rating. We see shares as undervalued. October quarter sales dropped 9% year over year and 5% sequentially to $1.31 billion, at the high end of management guidance. Commercial communications continued its decline dropping 17% year over year and 7% sequentially. This end market declined 7% in fiscal 2023 for Keysight, led largely by weaker spending at data center and wireless customers that we see as broad-based and not specific to Keysight. This was the first quarter of weakness for the electronic and industrial segment, or EISG, which dipped 7% year over year. EISG had served as an offset to communications weakness over fiscal 2023 with midteens growth in the past three quarters, but is seeing weaker spending in China, where Keysight has consumer and semiconductor manufacturing exposure.","We think Keysights large research and development budget has created a competitively advantaged portfolio for communications testing that we dont expect other firms would be able to easily replicate. Keysight holds a majority share of the 5G testing market, which we think will elicit strong top-line growth and expand profitability over the next five years. We expect Keysight to convert over 100% of net income into free cash flow, and predict it to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow annually over our forecast.","We think Keysight faces an uphill battle to disrupt an automotive testing market which we think is more fragmented and competitive. In our view, Keysights reliance on M&A to build out its portfolio creates risk of stagnating growth if its target pipeline dries up, or of destroying value if it overpays for bolt-ons. Keysights transition to a recurring revenue model for its software and services is still nascent, and we think the firm has a long way to go to increase the stickiness of its solutions.",21/11/2023,"We think Keysight Technologies is the leader in communications testing and measurement solutions, and offers a vendor-agnostic way to invest in the rapidly growing 5G and high-speed networking markets. In our view, Keysight has the strongest and broadest communications testing capabilities in the market, inclusive of hardware, software, and services. We think a comprehensive portfolio allows Keysight to act as a strategic partner to its customers, enabling new designs and accelerating time to market for network operators, network equipment OEMs, device OEMs, and suppliers.  We believe that Keysight can reduce time to market for customers more than competitors as a result of its end-to-end portfolio of premium offerings. We think Keysights leadership stems from its large investment in R&D that it focuses on the communications market. We also think hefty organic and inorganic investment has led to Keysight leading the market pivot toward software and credit its unmatched portfolio breadth for its top market share. We also contend that a broad portfolio that layers software and services on top of hardware embeds Keysight into customer workflows and entrenches customers in its ecosystem. A broad, sticky portfolio underpins our wide economic moat rating for the firm.  Keysight should continue to dominate the communications market, especially as it pivots toward more complex 5G testing in which it is already demonstrating proficiency. We forecast market share gains for Keysight and think greater complexity in 5G networks will expand its wallet share at customers--both of which would result in continued outperformance of the underlying testing market. We expect the firm to continue shifting customers to subscription billing for its software and services and think it will complement continued organic investment with strategic M&A to further build out its software portfolio. We expect the growing mix of software and services to expand margins. Finally, we forecast Keysight to continue generating impressive cash flow and to send a large proportion of it back to shareholders. ","In our view, Keysight Technologies possesses a wide economic moat owing to intangible assets in the design of test and measurement equipment and software and switching costs for its portfolio of solutions. We think Keysight is a leader in testing and measurement, helping OEMs and all tiers of suppliers accelerate time to market for new products in the communications, aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial, and semiconductor markets. We dont expect any competitor to encroach on Keysights leadership--especially in communications--and expect the firm to earn economic profits over the next 20 years as a result of its comprehensive portfolio that layers software and services over hardware. Testing equipment is used by OEMs and suppliers during research and development and manufacturing to fine tune chips and devices to exact specifications. For example, Keysight manufactures millimeter wave transceivers and radio frequency emulators to test an RF chipsets ability to transceive signals amid a variety of interference environments and signal strengths. Oscilloscopes can analyze the amplitude and frequency of a 5G signal in testing out a base stations effectiveness. Similarly, Ethernet channel testing solutions enable suppliers to test the effectiveness of optical transceivers in data transfer and connectivity in a data center, connected car, or other application. We believe Keysight is the leading player in the communications testing market, in part from being the only player to service the entire communications ecosystem. Keysights portfolio addresses all layers of the communications stack, from the physical layer all the way through to the application software layer. We think having the most comprehensive communications testing portfolio in the marketplace makes Keysight a more efficient solution and gives it a leg up in acquiring new customers. Testing is an integral part of the development process, with engineers iterating designs in simulation software, testing different prototypes, and then implementing quality control in manufacturing. Each step introduces new variables to account for, and using multiple testing vendors across development can require calibrating equipment together and ensuring measurement differences arent resulting from different equipment. By using Keysight tools and software at each step, engineers can remove variability between each step, saving critical development time and accelerating time to market. Keysight takes this one step further with its PathWave platform, which aggregates software analysis from each step of the development process into one place, reducing variability and iterations and simplifying the process for engineers. In one case study, NTT Docomo credits using a comprehensive Keysight solution for shortening development time for its 5G deployment at the Tokyo Olympics by at least 20% and going to market a full year faster than the competition. With a portfolio addressing all facets of communications and including software, Keysight stands out among its testing peers as a strategic partner. Rather than selling into a specific portion of a customers development, Keysight can offer a complete strategy for reducing time to market that features its tools and software. We think unmatched portfolio breadth and leading capabilities have led to Keysight holding one of the top market shares overall in testing and measurement, a leading position in communications, and a dominant share of the 5G testing market. Management estimates that Keysight holds 25% of the overall testing and measurement market and estimates that 75% of 5G designs globally--between base stations and devices--have been developed using Keysight solutions. We posit that Keysights advantage in communications testing and measurement stems from hefty investment in research and development and vertically integrated production. While some of its peers invest similar proportions of sales into R&D, Keysight exceeds all of them in size, so its total R&D investment in a given year nearly doubles that of the nearest competitor. We think large R&D investment has allowed Keysight to invest aggressively in software and be first to market with a platform like PathWave. Moreover, Keysight gains efficiency from partial vertical integration, with about 50% of manufacturing taking place in-house. The firm operates its own fab in Santa Rosa, California, which it co-locates with its R&D staff. This allows the firm to quickly take designs into production and troubleshoot, rather than waiting on a foundry partner with myriad other customers to serve. We think this improves R&D efficiency and allows Keysight to maintain its high organic investment while staying profitable. Among its peer group, Keysight is the only one in the top three of both R&D as a percentage of sales and operating margin. In our view, the ability to invest twice as much as competitors while maintaining top-tier operating profits gives us confidence in Keysights ability to maintain its innovation lead over the next 20 years. We also think Keysights moat is bolstered by switching costs, stemming from an end-to-end solution set combining hardware, software, and services. Keysights solutions service the entire design cycle, from design and simulation all the way through to volume manufacturing and operation. We view Keysight as a one-stop-shop for customers and think this leads to switching costs as entire workflows get designed around Keysights solutions. Keysights comprehensive portfolio not only improves efficiency at customers but makes ripping its solutions out even harder--a customer would likely have to source from multiple suppliers if it chose to leave Keysight. For example, Keysight is the only testing player to supply electronic design automation (EDA) software for chips, which is typically a standalone market. Switching away from Keysight would likely require sourcing from multiple new testing suppliers and a new EDA supplier, too. We also think that Keysights focus on selling into research and development versus manufacturing leads to stickier customer relationships. R&D relationships tend to be quite close-- sales usually involve one engineer at a time. In our view, individual engineers exhibit stronger personal preference and stickiness than a company as a whole--once an engineer adopts Keysight into their workflow (and so long as it satisfies their needs), we think theyd be loath to learn an entirely new solution. Furthermore, selling early in development to R&D makes Keysight more likely to win manufacturing placements later in development. Manufacturing testing (quality control) is typically dual-sourced, but if a given supplier is used in R&D, its likely to be used predominantly in manufacturing, further reducing variability between measurements. A second testing supplier would then be used as a check, ending in roughly a 70%/30% split for Keysight and the competitor, respectively. We think Keysight entrenches customers even further by layering software on top of its solutions. It is our view that layering software on top of enterprise hardware creates an overall stickier combined solution that engrains itself deeper in customer workflows. Although all oscilloscopes, signal analyzers, and other testing hardware run on embedded software, Keysight has been pivoting to proprietary analytical software to optimize testing and measurement with its hardware. Keysights applications save engineers time by automatically analyzing massive quantities of data--an oscilloscope can make 256 billion measurements per second--and Keysights customers can aggregate all their data and subsequent analysis in its PathWave platform. Moreover, Keysights applications are modifiable. A Keysight application engineer will help customize a program to fit an engineers specific requirements at installation. We think an integral software approach with customization embeds Keysights tools into customer workflows and makes cobbling together a replacement difficult. Customers would have to replace more than physical tools, and adapt entire workflows to new software--or face the prospect of not finding similar functionality from a new vendor. Finally, we think the inclusion of services into customer contracts further augments Keysights stickiness. We think services both elongate the average duration of contracts and further embed customers in the Keysight ecosystem. Keysight has 68 regional services centers globally and locates them near hubs of customers. Keysights services vary in intensity. At a base level, Keysight customers utilize repair and calibration services annually or biannually--equipment needs to be calibrated for accurate measurements, similar to tuning a guitar or violin. Additionally, Keysight application engineers can work with customers to offer troubleshooting, usage guidance, and tweaking of software. For large customers, application engineers will even work on-site at a customer, integrating into the design team. In our view, services allow a customer to use their solutions for longer and create a stickier overall solution as software and workflows become customized to having Keysight as an on-demand partner. We think deep partnership and services has led to long customer relationships--sometimes lasting decades. We think Keysights sticky portfolio has led to a strong base of high-margin recurring revenue that we think will enable it to continue earning excess returns on invested capital. According to management, adding services to a contract can double the gross margin of a deal--and come at little additional cost to the firm. We credit growing software and services sales for helping to expand gross margins since Keysights spinoff in 2014. Software and services now make up more than one third of Keysights top line, and we expect this number to expand. In 5G applications, which we expect to become a significant portion of sales, software alone can make up 40% of a contract. Additionally, over two thirds of Keysights engineers are now focused on software, and many of the firms recent acquisitions have been software-centric--exhibiting a companywide pivot toward software. In our view, strong recurring revenue gives us confidence in Keysights ability to retain customers in its ecosystem and in turn earn economic profits over a 20-year horizon.","We assign Keysight Technologies a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The firm is heavily exposed to the communications market, and we think any downturn or slowdown in this market would have an outsize effect on Keysights results. Additionally, much of our forecast for the firms top-line growth and profitability rests upon 5G network buildouts, and slower-than-expected adoption could hamper Keysights growth and profitability. We also think Keysight faces risk from its mix shift toward software. We view Keysight as the leader among its peers in the transition but think the pivot offers an opportunity for a competitor to disrupt the market. If Keysight fails to maintain its leadership in software, its competitive position could weaken. In our view, Keysights active M&A strategy poses another risk. We forecast a steady stream of tuck-in acquisitions for the company helping to pad growth and profitability. If the firm fails to make the right deals, or overpays for targets, it could hamper growth and destroy value. If Keysights inorganic strategy slows altogether, it could risk losing key additions to competitors and its competitive advantage could grow slimmer. Finally, we foresee minimal environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk for Keysight. The firms greatest material ESG issue (MEI) in our view is the risk of losing human capital to competitors, but we dont see evidence of this happening and think a strong variable compensation program helps keep talent motivated to remain at the firm.","We rate Keysight Technologies Capital Allocation as Standard, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Keysights stated capital allocation priorities, in order, are organic investment, strategic M&A, and share repurchases. We think Keysights balance sheet is in sound position, with a net cash position and long-dated debt maturities. We also think Keysights investment strategy is fair. We approve of the firms focus on organic investment, specifically in R&D, which we think has allowed it to carve out a wide economic moat. We also think that Keysights M&A strategy has given it access into high-growth future markets like quantum, and has helped it to transition to a more integrated software approach. Finally, we think Keysights shareholder distributions are appropriate. The firm targets sending 50% of its free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of repurchases. We also credit the firm for focusing on investment first, while using its heady free cash flow to send leftover cash to shareholders.","Keysight Technologies is a leader in the field of testing and measurement, helping electronics OEMs and suppliers alike bring products to market to fit industry standards and specifications.

25/11/2023,Danaher Has Spun Off the Veralto Assets to Shareholders,Danaher Corp,DHR,4,24/10/2023,Julie Utterback,221.41,USD,24/11/2023,243.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,24/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Danaher turned in solid third-quarter results, as its bioprocessing business appears to be bottoming near management expectations. At first blush, we do not anticipate changing near-term expectations or our $243 fair value estimate materially, which incorporates the Veralto spinoff. Danaher's shares remain moderately undervalued. After the pandemic boom years, Danaher's results continued to reset in the third quarter with revenue down 12% on a core basis (in constant currency and organically) while adjusted EPS declined 21%. This top-line performance included significant declines in former high-flying businesses. Specifically, the new biotechnology segment, which provides bioproduction tools for drug makers and benefited from COVID-19 vaccine production in recent years, declined 21% on a core basis. This decline reflected inventory destocking, more cautious buying from emerging and established customers due to external uncertainties, and challenges in China. However, that business hit management expectations and may be in the process of finding a bottom in demand. The diagnostics segment, which benefited from COVID-19-related testing in recent years, declined 16% on a core basis, although the Cepheid business outperformed expectations. With this deleveraging on the top line, margins contracted too, which caused the EPS decline. For 2023, our expectations have not changed materially. Management expects a core revenue decline in the low double digits, which is on the weak end of its previous expectations without the Veralto assets. However, with Danaher's focus on continuous improvement, it maintained an adjusted operating margin assumption of around 29%, which is a good sign for future margin development. Also, beyond the ongoing reset and Veralto spinoff that could constrain results into 2024, we still expect Danaher to return to more normal growth patterns, including high-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit earnings growth in the long run.","The Danaher Business System focuses on continuous improvement, including the acceleration of core growth and margin expansion through marketing initiatives and innovation, which appears positive for Danaher's long-term prospects.  Danahers shift to healthcare markets has created a less cyclical business in attractive markets with high barriers to entry and impressive recurring consumables revenue streams. Danaher has plenty of opportunities to consolidate and improve performance in its targeted life science and diagnostic end markets. ","Danaher continues to hunt for acquisitions in the life sciences and diagnostics markets, which could constrain ROICs including goodwill if it makes acquisitions at unattractive prices and is not able to integrate them as successfully as in the past. Danaher faces significant competition in its target niches and must remain dedicated to ongoing innovation to remain relevant, which is not guaranteed. As the the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into an endemic situation, Danaher's growth has declined in 2023, and more challenges, such as in China, have emerged.",02/10/2023,"Through its Danaher Business System, Danaher aims for continuous improvement of its scientific technology portfolio by seeking out attractive markets and then making acquisitions to enter or expand within those fields and divest assets that are no longer seen as core, such as the recently divested Veralto operations. After acquisitions, Danaher aims to accelerate core growth at acquired companies by making research and development and marketing-related investments. It also implements lean manufacturing principles and administrative cost controls to boost operating margins. Overall, we appreciate Danaher's strategic moves, which have pushed it into attractive end markets with strong growth prospects and sticky, recurring revenue streams. Danaher's acquisition-focused strategy has contributed to it becoming a top-5 player in the highly fragmented and relatively sticky life science and diagnostic tool markets about 20 years after its first acquisition in the space (Radiometer in 2004). Recent life science and diagnostic acquisitions have included Beckman Coulter, Pall, and Cepheid. In early 2020, Danaher completed the acquisition of GE Biopharma, now called Cytiva, which fills in some gaps for Danaher within the biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing tool market. Within the life sciences field, we find that end market particularly attractive given its strong growth trajectory, high margins, and high switching costs associated with regulatory and reproducibility concerns of end users. Management has started making more acquisitions in that space, such as Aldevron, and we would expect more tuck-in acquisitions in this and other end markets. Danaher also continues to prune its portfolio of businesses. The recent divestiture of its environmental and applied solutions group (now called Veralto) is just the latest for the company that distributed shares in the now publicly traded Fortive Corp (industrials) in 2016 and Envista (dental) in 2019 directly to shareholders. More divestitures are possible in the future, as well.","We believe a narrow moat surrounds Danahers diversified set of businesses. While Danahers merger, acquisition, and divestiture activities have cut into its returns on invested capital including goodwill in recent years, our narrow moat rating recognizes the attractive fundamental qualities of its core businesses, which appear likely to sustain returns over capital costs for at least the next 10 years. Specifically, we see intangible assets and switching costs as moat sources for Danaher. Generally, the company offers differentiated technology that is protected by various intangible assets, including patents, brands, copyrights, and trademarks. Those intangible assets prevent identical copycats during a long period of time. Since even slightly differentiated technical features can cause an end user to prefer one tool over another in Danaher's precise scientific end markets, we see intangible assets around its differentiated technology. Also, once its products are chosen due to their differentiated features for a specific application, Danaher is often able to layer on substantial switching cost-related advantages. Danaher's tools enable the essential operations of its clients, and switching to a competitor's technology could change the outcome of those operations, which would be undesirable for users once Danahers products are incorporated into their work flow. Nearly 80% of Danahers revenue streams are recurring in nature, and most of those sales are considered captive, meaning customers cannot use another supplier if it wants to keep using Danahers instruments or equipment. That dynamic highlights the razor/razor blade model that Danaher pursues with its differentiated technology. However, the durability of Danahers competitive advantages differs by product set. We believe the life sciences segment enjoys the most durable competitive advantages, particularly in switching costs. The differentiated properties of Danaher's tools affect the performance, accuracy, and speed of the various research projects they enable, and those product features create intangible assets that inform decisions to use those tools in specific applications at the beginning of a research project. In order to remain relevant to scientists in early research phases, Danaher must continue to innovate, which contributes to its intangible assets in this business, as well. However once those initial decisions are made, we see a particularly sticky business in its drug development and manufacturing tools, which we estimate account for about one third of Danaher's business after the recent Veralto divestiture. With those products, Danaher serves biopharmaceutical firms from the discovery of a new molecule through the production of that medicine. Once Danahers products are chosen by the end user as part of the production process of a molecule at the beginning of the clinical trial process, the client is unlikely to switch suppliers for that tool due to regulatory and reproducibility factors. Additionally, if that molecule is successfully marketed, the revenue stream would likely continue through the products life cycle. From discovery to patent expiration, Danaher could generate recurring revenue for at least 20 years on a small molecule and even longer if the generic manufacturer chooses to use the same manufacturing methods for difficult-to-manufacture biologics that have life cycles beyond their patent expiration. That durability bodes well for the economic profitabilty in this business. In the rest of the firm's life science operations, we see a narrower moat in these generally shorter projects. However, concerns about reproducibility in the customers test results during the course of a research project can create some inertia to switch from those technologies during that period, too.In diagnostics, Danaher provides a broad set of tools--including clinical chemistry, immunoassays, hematology, tissue-based, and molecular diagnostics--which it sells primarily to hospitals, physician offices, and reference labs for use on patients blood, urine, or tissue samples. Economic moats in this business are derived from a mix of intangible assets and switching costs. Getting a diagnostic system placed in a lab initially relates to the differentiated features of Danahers proprietary technology, which contributes to the intangible assets moat source of this segment. However, once placed and in regular use, we see some switching cost advantages in Danahers diagnostic tools. Specifically, displacing the use of an established diagnostic platform can be challenging for competitors since labs are hesitant to disrupt systems that are integrated into their workflows, and pathologists can be particularly loyal influencers on diagnostic platforms. So even when a test is relatively simple scientifically, customers often show loyalty to tools that make their work-life easier through high automation and a broad set of test options. We would also note that diagnostic segments sales represent the highest percentage of recurring revenues of Danaher's segments. We do not see any major ESG risks at Danaher that would cut into its economic profitability at this time.","While Danaher's current business mix generates relatively stable results, uncertainty around demand for its toolsespecially in the currently challenging environmentand the firm's acquisition-focused strategy creates Medium uncertainty around future cash flows. On an underlying basis, the company's products should generate predictable revenue streams. In life sciences, demand for Danaher's products is largely influenced by the health of biopharmaceutical and academic research and development budgets, which are largely uncorrelated to economic cycles but have been challenged in this postpandemic environment. In diagnostics, Danaher sells systems and related consumables into hospital and other labs. While laboratory capital budgets can fall prey to economic cycles, we are comforted that this business relies much more on recurring sales than one-time system sales.Danaher's acquisition strategy also creates some uncertainty for shareholders. These activities create integration-related risks, although Danaher usually sails right through them with its Danaher Business System. Probably more importantly from an uncertainty perspective, Danaher hunts in target markets that have been richly valued in recent years, and if Danaher overpays on acquisitions, it may not be able to generate economic profits, eventually. Also, the company typically uses some debt leverage to finance these deals. If the company does not quickly deleverage after debt-funded transactions for any reason, acquisitions could eventually harm its financial flexibility. From an ESG perspective, we see limited risks for Danaher.","Our capital allocation rating on Danaher remains Exemplary and reflects our appreciation of the company's investment strategy and execution that contributes to its exceptional investment score. The company also sports a sound balance sheet and makes appropriate distributions to shareholders, in our opinion, which rounds out our view of its Exemplary capital allocation rating.We applaud Danaher's strategy and execution in the investment component of our methodology, in particular. Although acquisition-related constraints on returns on invested capital including goodwill are a mild cause for concern, we have a materially positive view of management's investment decisions from a strategic perspective. Danaher aims to invest in industries with attractive characteristics and strong brands within those industries. Importantly, the combination of Danaher's strong strategic direction and its exceptional execution enabled by the Danaher Business System suggests that the company's success with past acquisitions is repeatable. DBS focuses primarily on putting the best team on the field that will listen to customer needs, innovate to meet those needs, and continuously improve its operations; this has led to strong profit and cash flow growth, which has handsomely rewarded Danaher shareholders over the long run. Impairments have been rare for the company, which supports our view that management follows a disciplined acquisition strategy and that its excellent execution after acquiring targets is repeatable. Overall, we think its unique culture of continuous improvement sets Danaher apart from other roll-up strategies.The company's substantial acquisition appetite has inflated financial leverage at times, but we generally see its balance sheet management as sound, with medium unleveraged business risk and easily manageable debt obligations. For example, at the end of 2022, gross leverage stood around 2 times by our calculations, and debt remains a small part of the overall capital structure, with very few debt maturities that could trip up the company in the near future. Danaher has expressed a desire to maintain its investment-grade status, which we think is likely. However, the company remains highly acquisitive, and future acquisitions could significantly boost leverage from current levels, at times. In general, though, we would expect Danaher to boost debt leverage to make acquisitions, deleverage, and then do it all over again when another large acquisition target presents itself. In order to continue with its acquisition strategy while maintaining financial flexibility, Danaher does not typically repurchase shares, which we have viewed as a positive discipline, especially in the pandemic years when shares were largely overvalued, in our opinion. The company does pay a small dividend, which we think will continue to grow along with earnings. We view these activities as roughly appropriate from a shareholder distribution perspective, especially considering the firm's strategy and record on the acquisition front.Also of note, cofounding brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales retain influence over the company, which has roots in a real estate firm that was founded in 1969 but refocused in 1984 as Danaher. Steven Rales chairs the board, and Mitchell Rales chairs the board's executive committee. The brothers cumulatively owned approximately 11% of Danaher's outstanding shares as of early 2023. Tom Joyce, who had been CEO since 2014, retired in September 2020. He was succeeded by the head of the life sciences segment, Rainer Blair, a Danaher veteran. So far, we have seen a relatively smooth transition with few strategic or cultural changes. While Blair may want to put his own stamp on the organization, we suspect Danaher will continue to move toward more healthcare-focused applications through acquisitions and the recent divestiture of its nonhealthcare businessVeralto's environmental and applied solutions. We see that divestiture as merely another step forward on Danaher's path of continuous improvement.","In 1984, Danahers founders transformed a real estate organization into an industrial-focused manufacturing company. Through a series of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, Danaher now focuses primarily on manufacturing scientific instruments and consumables in two segments--life sciences and diagnostics--after the late 2023 divesititure of its environmental and applied solutions group, Veralto.","Danaher's acquisition-focused strategy makes financial flexibility and capital market access important. In recent years, the company has issued debt to make significant acquisitions, such as Beckman Coulter (2011), Pall (2015), Cepheid (2016), and Cytiva (2020) before deleveraging to more manageable levels again. At the end of 2022, gross leverage stood around 2 times by our calculations. Danaher has expressed a desire to maintain its investment-grade status, and we think that should be achievable. However, the company is highly acquisitive, and future acquisitions could significantly boost leverage from current levels before the company aims to return to more manageable levels.",DHR,Healthcare,165135400960.0,NYQ,3126656.0,USD,221.41000366210932,True,1,215.7453491210953,237.67121589474024,1
24/11/2023,CPICs Q3 Life NBV Turned Positive on Stabilizing Agent Headcount,China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co Ltd,601601,3,30/10/2023,Iris Tan,24.63,CNY,24/11/2023,26.0,High,,Standard,,30/10/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimates for Ping An Insurance, China Pacific Insurance, or CPIC, and New China Life Insurance, or NCI, at CNY 65 per A-share (HKD 71 per H-share), CNY 26 per A-share (HKD 30 per H-share) and CNY 23 per A-share (HKD 26 per H-share), respectively. Following in-line third-quarter results, we leave our 2023 new business value, or NBV, projections unchanged for these three insurers. As expected, Ping An and CPIC continued to deliver stronger-than-peer growth momentum, with cumulative nine-month NBV growing 30% and 37% year on year, respectively. Ping An delivered a 94% year-on-year increase in NBV per agent and CPIC a 38% increase in agent new premium. NCI did not disclose third-quarter NBV, but we expect it decelerated from the first half and remains weaker than peers', given slower new premium growth and narrower margins. We expect a significant slowdown in fourth-quarter sales industrywide as insurers shift their focus to product transition, agent training, and New Year sales. But Ping An and CPIC should continue to outperform, on successful agent reform. CPIC should be less affected by the tightened regulations on New Year presales, in our view.  Year-on-year contraction in cumulative nine-month net profits widened to 6%, 24%, and 15% for Ping An, CPIC and NCI, from 1% and 9% declines for Ping An and CPIC, and 9% growth for NCI in the first half, on weaker investment gains as a result of the faltering stock market and flat bond yields. The higher earnings volatility raises investors concern about future dividend outlooks. We prefer Ping An among Chinese insurers as we like Ping Ans strong growth momentum in the agent channel. Its management appeared to be more committed to a progressive dividend policy than peers, despite downward pressure on operating profits in 2023.","CPIC led peers in reporting the first positive growth in new business value in the third quarter of 2022, as a result of increasing sales contribution from productive premier agents which expanded to 68,000, or 23% of total headcount. The full implementation of life insurance reform starting from 2022 is expected to improve agent productivity and stabilize agent headcount in 2022. As one of the top three life insurers managing corporate pension funds in China, CPIC will benefit from increasing policy support and rising demand in this largely untapped market.","CPICs declines in both NBV margin and monthly average headcount were larger than those of leading peers in 2021, indicating more headwinds to come in 2022. The increasing competition for the nonauto insurance market is likely to drag CPIC's underwriting profitability. CPIC's life and P&C insurance market shares have declined, given its priority on value over volume growth.",10/11/2022,"China Pacific Insurances, or CPIC's, trusted brand and extensive distribution network establish a strong foundation for steady long-term growth, thanks to continuing improvements in agent productivity and the company's stronger-than-peer capital position. However, challenges remain in the no-moat firm's near-term prospects.  Its first round of agent transformation prior to 2018 was successful, thanks to favorable industry dynamics and regulators relaxation of the agent qualification requirement, and CPIC achieved faster-than-peer growth in both new premium and new business value, or NBV, growth. This was attributable to its lead in product mix optimization, with over 95% of total new premium generated from high-margin regular insurance sold through the agent channel. However, the expansion of its agent force is now facing a bottleneck after tightened product rules were introduced in late 2017. The changing customer behavior and tightening labor supply as a result of an aging population led to significant contractions in the sales of new insurance policies and agent headcount in 2021. In 2022, CPIC started a full implementation of in-depth reforms, including amended rules on agent compensation and management, an advanced training system for comprehensive protection of households and digitalization support to facilitate agency force professionalism. But the reform process was significantly hampered by repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and a difficult macroeconomic environment in 2022. In the third quarter, agent headcount has shown signs of stabilizing, with agent profitability continuing to improve. We expect growth in new business value to turn positive in 2023.  The ongoing comprehensive auto reform added pressure to CPIC's auto insurance business in 2021. The downward pricing pressure has mitigated in 2022. We expect nonauto insurance, including health, liability, and agriculture insurance, will continue to lead top-line growth of the P&C business but profitability would remain thin from a long-term perspective. ","We believe China Pacific Insurance has yet to establish a moat. The company has been transitioning toward the selling of longer-term protection-type insurance through the agent channel and has delivered steady progress during the past three years. Given the current industry phase (characterized by the dominance of highly commoditized insurance products amid industry restructuring) and low visibility regarding its true underwriting profitability in its life insurance segment--partially due to the distortion by expensive up-front policy acquisition costs and related operating expenses all being deducted in its income statementwe believe CPIC faces difficulty establishing sufficient customer switching costs to generate durable excess returns in the highly commoditized insurance market. In the past the agent channel contributed over 90% of CPICs new policy sales thanks to managements agent transformation strategy. Since a tightened product rule being introduced in late 2017, life insurers found it very difficult to further enhance agent productivity under such challenging market conditions. The market conditions have significantly deteriorated since 2020, on sharp contraction in agent headcount and weakening customer demand for protection-type products. We believe CPIC needs to improve agent productivity and product innovation via better targeted marketing, differentiated customer service, and customer profile delineation. As such, we believe CPIC has yet to demonstrate any cost advantage or high customer switching costs that can justify a moat. On the P&C business front, CPIC's large market share benefits from its reputable brands and strong presence in the market. Underwriting margins deteriorated due to intensifying competition in the auto insurance market after pricing liberation was first introduced in 2015. However, as the comprehensive auto pricing reform completed in late 2021. the industry reported recovery in underwriting margins. Benefiting from reduced claim costs during COVID-19 lockdowns and growing car ownership, CPIC saw across-the-board improvement in margins of major product lines in 2022. We expect CPIC's profitability to gradually improve at the cost of slower growth, but it is not likely to rebound to industry-leading levels, given the firm's weakness in the direct sales channel.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to our fair value estimate due to CPIC's revenue cyclicality, financial leverage, and operating leverage. Similar to most life insurers, CPICs primary risk lies in its investment portfolio. Losses in the investment portfolio or declines in reserves could quickly erode its equity cushion, potentially tipping the company toward highly dilutive capital refinancing. CPIC deploys over 54% of capital to cash, bank deposits, and highly rated bonds issued by the government, financial institutions, and large enterprises in China. Equity-related investments represented about 20% of the portfolio. The company also has exposure to other investments, including special debt-investment plans, wealth-management products, and other fixed-income investment, representing about 25% of the total portfolio as of mid-2022. Interest-rate liberalization and economic rebalancing contribute to a softer outlook for near-term investment returns. However, CPICs past investment performance is more consistent than that of most peers, and the firm's equity cushion seems adequate, covering 98% of the total amount of equity-related investment assets. ","Our capital allocation rating for CPIC is Standard. The companys balance sheet is sound. CPIC has a strong solvency position that showed good resiliency to capital market volatility over the past few years. Risk-based core solvency margin and comprehensive solvency margin were 260% and 266%, respectively, as of end-2021, well above the 150% regulatory target. Chinas Risk Oriented Solvency System, or C-ROSS II, has become effective from 2022. The new system has higher risk factors for real estate investment and nonstandard credit asset investments, and the sales of low-margin single premium. The new rules also introduce stricter recognition for actual capital, thus posing a negative impact for most firms, including CPIC. The adoption of the solvency II framework resulted in a significant decline in core and comprehensive solvency ratios. These two rates reached 201% and 290%, respectively, in mid-2022, standing well above the regulatory requirement of 50% and 100%.CPICs strategic investments include establishing a health ecosystem to better serve customers and control medical cost and use Big Data to empower its operations. The company established Guangci CPIC Internet Hospital in 2021 and launched its first product CPIC Family Doctor and a dedicated equity investment fund. We believe these efforts will better differentiate its product offering and enhance the stickiness of customers. CPICs dividend payout averaged 48% over the past five years. The companys dividend per share has been steadily increasing since 2016. We expect management will stick to a steady and progressive dividend policy in the future. ","With headquarters in Shanghai, China Pacific Insurance was established in 1988. The company is one of the largest providers of life and general insurance products and services. It is China's third-largest life insurer and third-largest general property and casualty insurer. The company strives for an integrated financial-services platform that consists of insurance, banking, and asset management.","CPIC boasts one of the strongest capital positions in the industry. CPICs group core solvency ratio and comprehensive solvency ratio were 260% and 266%, respectively, in 2021. This level stands above the 150% requirement from Chinas insurance regulatory body. The comprehensive solvency ratio of the life insurance business and P&C insurance business were 218% and 288%, respectively, in 2021. The adoption of the solvency II framework starting in 2022 resulted in a significant decline in core and comprehensive solvency ratios. These two rates reached 201% and 290%, respectively, in mid-2022, standing well above the regulatory requirement of 50% and 100%.CPICs dividend payout averaged 48% over the past five years. The companys dividend per share has been steadily increasing since 2016. However, the company reduced its dividend payout ratio to 36% for its 2021 net profits, from 50% in 2020 with absolute dividend per share declining by 17% against 2020 to CNY 1 per share in 2021. Management explained the decision was made in consideration of policy uncertainties during the transition period for the adoption of the China Risk-Oriented Solvency System, or C-ROSS II, framework starting on Jan. 1 2022, and future capital expenditure for technology, healthcare, and retirement service investments. We expect future dividend payout ratio will remain above 30%.",601601.SS,Financial Services,202197843968.0,SHH,21274152.0,CNY,24.809999465942383,True,0,28.15864183872716,23.9801265378519,0
24/11/2023,Penn Spending Aggressively Into Its ESPN Bet Launch but Competitive Advantage Still Elusive,PENN Entertainment Inc,PENN,3,,Dan Wasiolek,25.84,USD,23/11/2023,27.0,Very High,,Standard,C,,No Text Available,"We see Penn's domestic properties and partnership with ESPN as well positioned to benefit from the more than $40 billion U.S. sports betting and iGaming revenue opportunity by 2030. Penn has a strong omnichannel offering, which includes over 40 physical casinos, a digital platform of media assets and online wagering, and large loyalty membership of 27 million. The company is the leading online operator in Ontario, aided by its 2021 acquisition of theScore.","Debt levels are elevated, which could inflate financing costs for future renovations and investment. All cash flow for the company comes from the domestic region, which has lower barriers, demand, margins, and ROICs than Macao. The company faces ongoing competition from new domestic supply and competitive renovation to existing assets.",06/11/2023,"Penn Entertainment holds a leading omnichannel presence, which includes 43 physical casino assets, a digital portfolio encompassing an upgraded sports betting partnership with ESPN launching Nov. 14, 2023, iGaming, media, and a loyalty membership base of 27 million. As a result, we estimate Penn holds around a low-double-digit revenue share of the $60 billion domestic commercial casino gaming market. Despite this attractive omnichannel position, we don't believe U.S. gaming regions (100% of Penns EBITDAR) contribute to a moat for Penn. U.S. gaming demand is lower than in Asian regions like Macao and Singapore, where the propensity to gamble is much higher. Also, the 1,000 commercial and tribal casinos in the U.S. serve a total population of 334 million, well in excess of the 36 and two casinos found in Macao and Singapore, respectively, with Chinese and Singaporean populations of 1.4 billion and 5.6 million, respectively. Further, supply competition is ever present in U.S. gaming, as states increase the amount of wagering options and operators consistently renovate existing offerings. This compares with negligible additions in either Macao or Singapore, where we see no additional licenses for the foreseeable future. That said, Penn is positioned to benefit from the multi-billion-dollar sports betting and iGaming market. In fact, we expect the company to garner around 10% share by 2027 and expect margins to ramp to the low-20s by the end of the decade. We forecast for 38% of the company's total sales to be generated from its interactive business by 2027, a meaningful lift from 10% in 2022. Finally, we think its $2.5 billion in liquidity (at the end of 2022) and $2.1 billion in free cash flow to the firm generation through 2027 position it to service the $1.3 billion in debt scheduled to mature in 2026-27.","We dont think Penn Entertainment has an economic moat due to its outsize exposure to U.S. gaming markets where regulatory barriers are low and returns on invested capital measure in the single digits versus the low-double-digit level in the moaty Singapore and Macao gaming regions. This view is despite our sanguine stance on the companys sports betting, iGaming, and media business, where we see expanding sales and profits.The U.S. gaming market consists of about 1,000 commercial and tribal gaming casinos, compared with just two and 36 gaming locales in Singapore and Macao, respectively. This regional casino supply results in one U.S. casino for every 334,000 people versus 2.8 million and 39 million Singaporean and Chinese citizens per Singapore and Macao gaming property, respectively. Today, more than 40 states offer commercial and/or tribal gaming with many legalizing wagering activities in the past two decades. Gaming was legalized in Las Vegas in 1931 though it wasnt until 1976 when Atlantic City allowed gaming, offering the first real competitive option in the U.S. Then it wasnt until the 1990s that several states legalized games of fortune. In the Northeast (43% of Penns 2022 EBITDAR), Pennsylvania and Maryland approved slots in 2004 and 2008, respectively, followed by these states then allowing gaming tables in 2010 and 2012. Then, competition elevated further with Rhode Island approving gaming in 2000, with its first casino opening in 2007, and Massachusetts (after many failed attempts) and New York legalizing wagering in 2011 and 2013, respectively, with casinos there just beginning to open during the past few years. More recently, Pennsylvania gaming options have expanded once again, with the opening of five more casinos in 2020-23, resulting in a total of 17. Meanwhile, competition has increased in the South (28% of Penns 2022 EBITDAR), with Arkansas legalizing gambling in 2018, awarding four licenses, and Virginia approving four commercial casino locations in 2020, the first of which opened in January 2023. Further, Mississippi, which is one of many states to have no statutory limit on the number of licenses (Colorado, Iowa, Mississippi, Nevada, and South Dakota are the others), continues to add commercial casinos, amounting to 30 as of March 2023, up from 26 at the end of 2021, ranking only behind Nevadas 215 and Colorados 33 establishments at that time. Finally, incremental supply increases in the Midwest (26% of Penns 2022 EBITDAR) stand to keep competition elevated for Penn. Here, Illinois passed a bill in 2019 allowing its existing 10 casinos to expand to a maximum of 2,000 gaming positions from 1,200 previously, as well as permit six new casinos, the first of which opened in February 2023.Compared with the low-barrier characteristics of the overall U.S. gaming industry, we are more constructive on Penns opportunity in the attractive U.S. sports and iGaming wagering market. Las Vegas was the only jurisdiction to legally take sports wagers prior to a Supreme Court ruling in 2018 that opened the activity to other territories. Since that decision, more than 30 states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports wagering, driving the U.S. sports betting revenue market to $7.5 billion in 2022 from just $430 million in 2018, according to the American Gaming Association. Further, six states currently offer iGaming (casino game betting online), leading to sales of $5 billion in 2022 from about $500 million in 2019. In total, sports betting and iGaming represented a staggering two thirds of total U.S. gaming growth during 2019-22, highlighting the importance of this segment to industry operators. Also, we have observed improving profitability across key industry players, as no-moat companies MGM and Caesars have also turned the corner recently to profitability, with expectations for strong margin improvement in future years.Along with MGM and Caesars, we see Penn in an advantaged positioned to be a leader in the attractive U.S. sports betting and iGaming market, given its omnichannel presence. In our view, long-term winners in this industry will be those that have a physical retail presence to leverage mobile and loyalty assets. In that regard, Penns 43 retail casinos spread across 20 U.S. states position it well to compete with other industry leaders like Caesars and MGMs domestic portfolios of 56 and 29, respectively, as of the end of 2022. In fact, we calculate that Penn garnered about 11% revenue share of the U.S. commercial gaming market in 2022 versus the roughly 18% and 20% share captured by Caesars and MGM, respectively, though the latter two benefit from a higher Las Vegas to U.S. regional portfolio mix. But with the rapid legalization of sports and iGaming wagering the past few years, operators have needed to develop and integrate a mobile and loyalty offering into an omnichannel presence. Although Penns loyalty membership of 27 million individuals sits below Caesars and MGMs 65 million and 40 million, respectively, the company has an exclusive partnership with ESPN (launching in Fall 2023), which is a media asset that provides an audience of nearly 400 million social media followers, and theScore, which is a technology platform that offers increased control of expenses and innovation versus utilizing a third party (MGMs mobile business uses Entains technology platform). As a result, Penn can efficiently acquire, retain, and cross-sell customers across its physical and digital assets.We see evidence that Penns omnichannel position is yielding positive results. For one, Penns 2022 EBITDAR losses for its sports, iGaming, and media business were just $75 million (a negative 11% margin), compared with $666 million at Caesars (a negative 122% margin), which we think speaks to its ability to tap the 100-million-plus media members of its former partnership with Barstool, which has been replaced with the wider reaching ESPN assets in 2023. Additional evidence of the value afforded by Penns successful omnichannel presence is shown in the fact that 45% of all bets made during September 2022 of sports wagering in Kansas came from its Penn Play loyalty database, showcasing that new launches are resonating with the companys existing players. Additionally, Penn customers that visit one of its properties and bet on its online platform provide several times the annual revenue of one only visiting a casino, pointing to the lack of cannibalization between the retail and online offering. Further, Penns digital business benefits from its strong physical locations, as many states require operators to have a retail location to receive a sports betting or iGaming license. In fact, states often give multiple sports betting licenses, or skins, to land-based casino operators like Penn, which then sell those rights to companies without a physical presence in return for equity or we estimate around 10% of their net gaming sales, allowing them to mitigate some of the competitive threat of multiple players in a given market. Overall, we calculate the combination of Penns physical, loyalty, media, and mobile assets has led to its 5.3% revenue share of the U.S. sports and iGaming market in 2022, comping near the 4.4% and 5.8% we estimate for Caesars and MGM, respectively.That said, even though we are sanguine on Penns digital business, it is not enough to overcome the low barriers and returns in the U.S. gaming market. This is illustrated in low-single-digit level we estimate for Penns adjusted return on invested capital during 2023-27, near the level in 2021-22, and below its 8% weighted average cost of capital, supporting our no-moat rating for Penn.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Penn is Very High.A risk is a cyclical downturn in the United States, which can occur through slower economic growth or outbreaks like the coronavirus. U.S. commercial industry gaming revenue declined 31%, according to the American Gaming Association, in 2020 due to COVID-19; Penns sales dropped 33% in 2020. The company faces higher uncertainty associated with its outsize debt levels. Although there is no maturation of debt until 2026, when $331 million is due, a prolonged economic downturn or protracted drop in Penns competitive positioning could present challenges meeting debt obligations or obtaining incremental liquidity, which could occur at value-destructive levels.Finally, Penn faces environmental, social, and governance risks like gambling addiction, which could stoke government restrictions and affect demand. Also, its resorts operate at all hours and days of the year, using energy and supplies, which, if not properly managed, could discourage some visitation. Additionally, it has customer data that it must be careful to protect so as not to cause distrust.","We see Penns balance sheet as weak, its investment strategy as fair, and shareholder distribution as appropriate, resulting in a Standard capital allocation rating.While we see Penns revenue cyclicality and operating leverage as medium and note that a minimal amount of its total debt is scheduled to mature in the next three years, we think the companys overall debt level is high. Penns net debt/EBITDA was 7.3 times in 2022 (excluding obligations of $5.9 billion), and we expect it to average 4.7 times during the next five years. While Penn has no debt scheduled to mature until 2026, when $330 million is due, debt (including financial obligations) represents around 40% of the companys enterprise value at our existing fair value estimate.We hold a fair view of Penns investment strategy. We like the companys focus on growing its omnichannel business, which was supported by the strategic acquisitions of BarStool in 2020 (which was dissolved in 2023), theScore in 2021, and ESPN in 2023. These acquisitions and partnerships gave Penn access to digital technology and media users, which we believe will allow its digital and physical assets to keep pace among other no-moat leaders, namely Caesars and MGM. Penns shareholder distribution is appropriate, as we see the companys focus prudently remaining on improving its balance sheet position and reinvesting in its business to remain competitive. Dividends do not appear to be a priority, while we expect share repurchases to remain a lower priority to reducing debt leverage and reinvesting into sports betting. We see these decisions as judicious.","Penn Entertainments origins date back to its 1972 racetrack opening in Pennsylvania. Today, Penn operates 43 properties across 20 states and 12 brands (such as Hollywood Casino and Ameristar), with land-based casinos representing 90% of total sales in 2022 (10% was from the interactive segment, which includes sports, iGaming, and media revenue). The retail portfolio generates high-30% EBITDAR margins and helps position the company to obtain licenses for the digital wagering markets. Additionally, Penns media assets, theScore and ESPN (starting with its partnership launch Nov. 14, 2023), provide access to sports betting/iGaming technology and clientele, helping it form a leading digital position. ","Penns debt levels are elevated. In 2019, excluding lease obligations of $4.7 billion, Penns debt/adjusted EBITDA measured a hefty 15.4 times. Penns debt/adjusted EBITDA reached an improved 12.7 times in 2022, and we estimate it to end 2023 at 8.3 times as global leisure and travel market demand continue to recover. We see the $2.1 billion in free cash flow to the firm that we expect in 2023-27, along with the $2.3 billion in liquid cash and available credit as of Sept. 30, 2023, to be focused on reducing debt levels and investing in the digital sports and iGaming markets, with minimal share repurchases and no dividend during our 10-year forecast. Penn has no debt maturity until 2026, when $330 million is scheduled to come due. That said, EBIT interest coverage is on the thinner side, as we forecast the ratio at only 1.7 on average the next three years (2024-26).",PENN,Consumer Cyclical,3883504384.0,NMS,4024895.0,USD,25.84000015258789,True,0,22.842705962244704,22.2407407878321,0
24/11/2023,New China Lifes 2022 NBV Growth Weaker Than Peers on Sharp Contraction in Agent Headcount,New China Life Insurance Co Ltd,601336,2,30/10/2023,Iris Tan,32.04,CNY,24/11/2023,23.0,High,,Standard,,30/10/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimates for Ping An Insurance, China Pacific Insurance, or CPIC, and New China Life Insurance, or NCI, at CNY 65 per A-share (HKD 71 per H-share), CNY 26 per A-share (HKD 30 per H-share) and CNY 23 per A-share (HKD 26 per H-share), respectively. Following in-line third-quarter results, we leave our 2023 new business value, or NBV, projections unchanged for these three insurers. As expected, Ping An and CPIC continued to deliver stronger-than-peer growth momentum, with cumulative nine-month NBV growing 30% and 37% year on year, respectively. Ping An delivered a 94% year-on-year increase in NBV per agent and CPIC a 38% increase in agent new premium. NCI did not disclose third-quarter NBV, but we expect it decelerated from the first half and remains weaker than peers', given slower new premium growth and narrower margins. We expect a significant slowdown in fourth-quarter sales industrywide as insurers shift their focus to product transition, agent training, and New Year sales. But Ping An and CPIC should continue to outperform, on successful agent reform. CPIC should be less affected by the tightened regulations on New Year presales, in our view.  Year-on-year contraction in cumulative nine-month net profits widened to 6%, 24%, and 15% for Ping An, CPIC and NCI, from 1% and 9% declines for Ping An and CPIC, and 9% growth for NCI in the first half, on weaker investment gains as a result of the faltering stock market and flat bond yields. The higher earnings volatility raises investors concern about future dividend outlooks. We prefer Ping An among Chinese insurers as we like Ping Ans strong growth momentum in the agent channel. Its management appeared to be more committed to a progressive dividend policy than peers, despite downward pressure on operating profits in 2023.","Chinas emerging health insurance market has a low insurance density and penetration levels, growing at a 36% CAGR over the past four years and we expect it will grow at around 25% in the next five years. NCIs dividend payout ratio has increased to 30% since 2016 and we expect it to be maintained.  NCI's agent productivity in 2022 improved over 20% from 2021, and this trend continued into the first quarter of 2023.",The increasing sales of single premium bancassurance products increased NCI's interest rate sensitivity. NCIs heavy reliance on savings-type products might further dilute its underwriting margin. NCIs health insurance product pricing was hit by increasing competition from peers as the market gets more crowded.,03/04/2023,"NCI differentiates with a focus on the underserved health insurance business to drive value-oriented growth. However, facing rising industrywide headwinds and senior management changes, it seems to have come to a crossroad over further growth. Facing competition from high-yield shadow credit related investment products, NCI started a three-year campaign to restructure its business mix toward long-term and protection products, followed by the successful launch of its first health insurance product Jiankang Wuyou in 2015. Its second-stage reform started in 2019, which aimed at achieving a balanced growth between scale and value, establishing a wealth management platform and senior care business while solidifying its core life insurance business. NCI has achieved is scale target by growing its annual premium income to over CNY 163 billion in 2022. Its investment platform managed over CNY 1 trillion assets and NCI's three major senior care communities also commenced operation.  However, similar to peers, NCI still faces significant challenges in agent channel reform. Starting from 2019 China's life insurance market entered a turning point, and agent new business growth is no longer dependent on the so-called demographic dividend. The industrywide challenges were exacerbated by weakened customer demands and the lack of offline customer interactions during pandemic controls over the past three years. Customers are now better educated and demand more sophisticated products with attractive cost performance. Such demands also need to be served by higher quality agents with sufficient financial knowledge. As a result, agent headcount contracted 67% from 2020 to 197,000 by end-2022.  Facing the challenges, NCI is shifting some of the focus back to growth via sales of single premium products in the bancassurance channel. This channel performed well in 2022, but it failed to boost new business value growth as its underwriting profitability was low. We expect NCI's agent headcount to gradually stabilize in 2023 along with improving consumer confidence. ","Insurers generally do not benefit from favorable competitive positions in our view. Industry competition is fierce and the products are essentially commodities. Further, most participants do not know the cost of goods sold for a number of years, resulting in high risks of underpricing policies without knowing it. Firms have a significant incentive to chase growth without regard for profitability, a cycle that repeats itself as competitors are forced to match artificially low prices or risk losing business.We assign a no-moat rating to New China Life because we dont think the company has a stronger-than-peer cost advantage or intangible assets. The company is still undergoing in-depth business restructuring to reduce its reliance on short-term savings product sales. We believe its product development capability and agent productivity are weaker than leading peers such as AIA. Its agent business reform has yet to see turning point in new business value growth. Dragged by contraction in new business margin due to unfavorable product mix shift to savings-type products to meet customer needs for principal-guarantee savings in low-rate environment, we expect NCIs new business value growth to face greater-than-peer downward pressures. NCIs business mix had a relatively high exposure to the bancassurance channel. This channel reported solid growth during pandemic period as a result of improving attractiveness of savings-type insurance products during falling interest rate cycle. However, single premium products continued to contribute the bulk of new policies sold. Thus we believe NCIs other distribution channel, including bancassurance and group channels still need further restructuring in terms of its product offering and better training of salespeople. ","Given NCI's complex business lines and the nature of risk in its insurance business, we assign a high uncertainty rating to our fair value estimate. NCI's embedded value is vulnerable to equity market volatility, given investment income represents a significant portion of total revenue and operating earnings. Investment linked to stock markets, including equity investments, represents about 23% of NCI's investment portfolio, in line with peers.In 2022, the group allocated 50% in bond investment and 19% in cash and term deposits. Non-standard assets investment, including debt-related and equity-related investments accounted for 4% and 9% of total investment, respectively. Though most of the investment counterparties are large state-owned enterprises, local governments, or projects with bank guarantees, we are concerned this asset category carries higher regulatory risks or systematic risks if the economy experiences unexpected shocks.NCI also faces higher-than-peer interest-rate risks due to its higher exposure to savings products. According to its sensitivity analysis, a 50 basis point decline in interest rate will lead to a 48% decline in new business value. NCIs key economic assumptions are prudent compared with peers, with the risk discount rate and investment return being assumed at 11% and 5.0%, respectively. If the company were to revise down its investment return to reflect lower interest rate outlooks, the according downward adjustment to its risk discount rate will be likely to offset one quarter of the negative impact to embedded value.","Our capital allocation rating for New China Life is Standard. The companys balance sheet is sound, and it has a strong solvency position that showed good resiliency to capital market volatility over the past few years. Risk-based core solvency margin and comprehensive solvency margin were 140% and 238%, respectively, by 2022, standing well above the regulatory requirement of 50% and 100%, under Chinas risk oriented solvency system, or C-ROSS II. New China Lifes largest initiatives were salesforce transformation and technology upgrade, and it has accelerated the transformation and upgrade of its channels and salesforce. It will explore multi-dimensional and tiered management, step up training and policy support, and take multiple measures to cultivate a high-quality sales team. With technology empowerment, the company looks to optimize product offering and improve industrial coordination, and strengthen risk control and practice compliance operation. New China Lifes dividend payout averaged 30% over the past five years. Payout ratio has been steadily staying above 30% since 2016. The companys dividend per share has been steadily increasing since 2013, except for the challenging 2020 and 2022 results which reported significant declines in dividend per share. We expect management will stick to a steady dividend policy. ","Headquartered in Beijing, New China Life Insurance, or NCI, was founded by SOEs and private firms in 1996. The company is the fourth-largest life insurer in China in terms of total assets. Huijin Investment, the governments investment company owns 31% shares of New China Life. The company was listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Stock Exchanges in 2011. New China Life offers comprehensive life insurance products and services to individual customers and institutional customers through nationwide distributional networks and diversified marketing channels, manages and deploys insurance funds through its subsidiaries, including Asset Management Company and Asset Management Company (Hong Kong).","NCIs financial health has improved in the past thanks to its improving operating margin and healthy investment return, which has benefited as investment regulation was relaxed since 2013. But investment performance of insurers was under significant pressures during 2020 and 2022. The adoption of solvency II framework starting in the first quarter of 2022 resulted in a significant decline in core solvency ratio and modest decline to comprehensive solvency ratio. These two rates has declined to 140% and 238%, respectively, in end-2022, standing well above the regulatory requirement of 50% and 100%. NCIs financial leverage is relatively higher than peers, with assets to equity of over 10 times by 2021.",601336.SS,Financial Services,79040544768.0,SHH,8111910.0,CNY,32.5099983215332,True,0,38.16319873009506,30.68531654454558,0
24/11/2023,Delta Electronics' EV Strength Trumps Near-Term Softness in Automation and Telecom,Delta Electronics Inc,2308,3,02/11/2023,Phelix Lee,316.5,TWD,24/11/2023,331.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,02/11/2023,"We lower our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Delta Electronics to TWD 331 from TWD 357 to account for higher minority interests in the electric vehicle business. After falling 23% over the past three months, shares have become attractive after pricing in near-term negatives for sluggish demand in non-artificial intelligence servers and factory automation. We think Deltas shares are undervalued, and a combination of Chinas recovery, the end of the United Auto Workers union strikes in the U.S., and secular EV adoption will be the catalysts. We reduce our revenue by 2% to 5% for 2023-27 on more cautious telecom and networking infrastructure sales assumptions since we see less chance for 5G investments to pick up. The 2023-27 EPS forecasts are cut by 3% to 11% to factor in a higher share of profits attributable to minority shareholders of the EV businesses, of which a large portion is conducted through its listed subsidiary Delta Thailand. Despite these adjustments, we remain confident that Delta Electronics benefits from a structural shift to EVs, benefiting both its powertrain and charging facilities operations. We also expect that after a slow 2023, server operators could be more rational in allocating their spending between conventional central processing unit-based servers and AI-oriented graphics processing unit servers. Management expects ex-charger EV revenue to top USD 1.4 billion in 2023, compared with 2022's USD 800 million, and grow another 40%-50% in 2024. EV revenue will be disclosed separately starting in 2024, which we welcome as the EV operations have midteens gross margin, and lumping them into the power segment could be misleading. Their confidence is backed by new factories to be built in Thailand, India, and China. We think the figures are achievable given Deltas track record and the settlement between UAW and U.S. automakers should quell concerns about interruptions for the next few years.",Demand for Deltas power stations will grow with power-hungry data centers and telecom base stations. The companys leading position in power supplies is secure thanks to customer aversion to quality issues. Deltas strong balance sheet enables it to continue acquiring targets with technical specialties.,Building automation remains small if the company faces unexpectedly difficulties integrating its acquisitions. NEV business grows slower than other component suppliers as the company has less exposure in Chinese automakers. Most of Deltas recent revenue growth comes from acquisitions instead of organic growth.,02/11/2023,"Delta Electronics' competitiveness and reputation are built on its expertise in power management. It enables the firm to offer energy-efficient solutions that conform to standards of different industries and regions. The stringent requirements of telecom, server and data center applications are perfect showcases of Deltas moat. Together they contribute about 30% of revenue. We think growth of the data center business will be driven by accelerating data generation and upselling of cooling, power management, and monitoring systems to existing enterprise customers. For telecom products, 5G rollouts should last years, as 3 times more base stations are needed compared with 4G. We believe Deltas reputation should reassure data center customers of optimized energy usage; and telecom clients of reliability in adverse conditions. Delta is a top supplier of power supplies, which is also a testament to its strength in power management, making up over 30% of revenue. We find mainframe computer, and server-related products to have the strongest switching costs as critical business processes like validating secure transactions and large-scale data analytics are done there. Automation business contributes 15% of revenue. Delta plans to work more closely with industrial automation distributors in the printing, food packaging and weaving sectors, a sensible move in our view to differentiate from Shenzhen Inovances focus on elevators. Building automation is a rising star, which may require future acquisitions to expand in Europe and boost its product portfolio. We view switching costs are high, as components, programs and monitoring systems knit tightly together with factories or buildings. The new energy vehicle, or NEV, segment is growing fast and turned profitable in early 2023. Delta supplies traction motors and converters; as well as the power systems for charging stations, mostly to Western automakers. As China strives to widen its lead in NEVs, we prefer to see Delta serving more Chinese NEV-makers, even if it means short-term margin erosion.","We assign a narrow moat rating to Delta based on switching costs and intangible assets. We believe 70% of Deltas product lines (30% in infrastructure, 25% in components, 15% in automation) in terms of revenue are moatworthy, given their stringent safety and uptime requirements, and have long operating life spans. Its expertise and strong reputation in power management is the key moat driver in the component and infrastructure segments, as evidenced by its 30% market share in the 2022 power supply market. In particular, we estimate Delta to own over 50% global market share in server power systems, over 50% in telecom power systems and nearly 40% in mainframe computer power systems. The benefits are especially pronounced in telecom power systems, as carriers highly value operability in adverse conditions and high power levels. Similar requirements, but to a lesser degree, apply to data centers--where Delta holds nearly 20% market share--and computer systems; also motivating buyers to value quality over price. Customers' loyalty is strong in direct sales, as Delta designs entire systems for customers and supplies most of the critical components. Some examples are supplying motors and converters to Fiat Chrysler; or building automation systems involving elevator controls. In this case, the programs run are integrated with the hardware, and porting to other suppliers hardware may be unfeasible. Historical the return on invested capital, or ROIC, was consistently above WACC, supporting our view. We expect ROIC to continue to be higher than WACC in the next 10 years.Integrated system designs create sticky infrastructure customers. The infrastructure business also benefits from long lifecycles. Data centers, networking and telecom infrastructure power systems make up about 30% of Deltas sales. It has nearly 20% market share in the power management infrastructure market, chiefly serving power systems--housing inverters, rectifiers and other electrical components--to telecom bases and data centers, enhanced by acquiring Norway-based Eltek AS in 2015. Customers in this field include telecom carriers like China Unicom, corporations running their own data centers, networking companies including Cisco and power-grid players like the Taiwan government and Chinese renewable energy generators. This also means Delta does not compete with or supply to server manufacturers like Lenovo or telecom equipment providers like Huawei.Power systems in telecom, data centers and networking applications all involve a higher level of expertise than consumer and commercial-grade devices and equipment as they run on much higher power levels. High uptime is important, and many performance pledges involve uptime guarantees (often quoted in number of nines, for example five ""9s"" equal 99.999% uptime). Failure to do so has many consequences, including but not limited to refunds for not reaching guaranteed uptime, loss of customer data, litigation arising from a lower level of service, interrupted emergency call services, local blackouts, injuries and deaths. In the longer run, a stable power system is essential to carry out controlled experiments, long sessions of high-tech manufacturing and hosting large populations in general.Deltas strong moat in telecom power systems is driven by long qualifying procedures and ironclad relationships with carriers, bolstered by the Eltek acquisition. Telecom equipment has additional requirements for outdoor operations and ruggedness, which enables Delta to leverage its reputation in power management to retain customers. Telecom equipment works at high power levels because it has to service thousands of devices simultaneously nonstop while satisfying different power requirements from 2G to 5G frequencies. Apart from previously mentioned consequences, telecom carriers may also face lower priority in future frequency allocation (a scarce resource that is limited physically) if their reliability is lower than peers.Data centers and servers do not have outdoor requirements as telecom power systems do, because they are stored in places free from environmental hazards. But they have other criteria regarding cooling efficiency and power consumption. We think Deltas positioning is different from other data center/networking service providers, as it excels in energy management, particularly in cooling--the biggest operating expense. Customers are likely to perceive Delta to be more capable of offering power-efficient solutions, given its reputation in power management. These customers face switching costs in several areas. First, when a corporation mulls expanding its data center(s), Deltas knowledge of customers networking and organization structures enables better upselling. Secondly, given operating expense savings from Deltas equipment, it would be difficult to justify replacing Deltas products with rival offerings. Thirdly, power, cooling and monitoring systems are intertwined, making replacements difficult without risking long downtimes.Delta competes with fellow power suppliers like C&D Technologies on data center power. The company focuses on meeting power system demands from the private cloud market, targeting corporations that are averse to having their data hosted by external servers.The remaining 5% of infrastructure consists of NEV charging stations, renewable energy power systems and power systems used on large premises. We refrain from assigning a moat to these newer businesses as there is no indication of consistent above-weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, returns in NEV charging stations. On renewables, Delta competes with storage battery system providers--Tesla being the best known; as well as industrial automation firms like Inovance, which are building up their renewable energy products. Delta could be stronger at power supply components, but this advantage may be countered by software capabilities, geographical coverage and other factors.Delta has built a strong reputation in power products among global giants. Deltas power supply and components segment contains many products. Power supplies such as chargers and adaptors and fans have the strongest moats within the segment. Most of Deltas power supplies are used on laptops, desktops, mainframe computers and servers. All major PC-makers are Deltas customers and some of them have three decades of relationships. Deltas key intangible assets are its familiarity with global power standards and high quality power supplies. It has been consistently recognized by customers and end users. We estimate Delta holds nearly 40% market share in mainframe computer power systems and over 50% in server power systems. Mainframe computers and servers are especially moatworthy, as they operate on higher power than desktops and laptops, undergo regular component hot-swapping, that is changing components with the machine switched on, and are often vital to corporate functions. Corporate servers have many uses, such as hosting work portals, files, database and programs; and linking workstations with printers, mailing and other systems. Mainframe computers perform a multitude of heavy-duty processing tasks, like analyzing populations of entire countries or handling millions of secure financial transactions every hour. A breakdown of mainframe computers and servers can be very disruptive as corporate workflow often relies on them to validate processes and authenticate transactions. The critical nature of mainframe computers and servers allows Delta to maintain its high market share through its strong reputation and expertise in power management; and make corporations averse to switching from Deltas power management products. PC makers display similar risk aversion. Historically the decline of PC-makers has been more permanent, meaning short-term setbacks or a short chain of events were enough to sink a brand. These setbacks or events can be recalls, quality issues, accidents involving heavy injuries (for example exploding batteries or adaptors) or staff misdemeanors. Given the lack of switching costs between PC brands--particularly those running Windows or Linux, short life span of PCs and lack of battery or power expertise on the part of a PC brand--we believe it is too risky for PC brands to switch from Delta to lesser-known suppliers, especially when power supplies make up a small portion, estimated at less than 3%, of total material costs. Given decades of history working with international brands, it can manufacture large quantities of power supplies reliably that can adapt to the standards of different countries, in terms of current, voltage, frequency, plug shapes, grounding and other safety requirements. Upcoming products like NEV traction motors, DC/DC converters and inverters are also moatworthy in our view. Even though NEV products are incurring losses, we believe the switching cost argument applies as Delta serves Western carmakers such as Fiat Chrysler. Western automakers tend to space models further apart than their Chinese counterparts. We estimate Deltas market share of NEV motors is less than 5% globally, due to Chinas overwhelming share in NEV sales and Deltas customers may delay some of their 2020 releases. NEV products make up nearly 10% of sales and are expected to grow faster than power supplies. NEV-related products are subject to the long accreditation processes on company- and product-levels, which typically last 18-36 months. After that, non-Chinese vehicle models are on the market for five years. The motor components and power systems that Delta offer have stringent requirements on safety, reliability and operability. Switching costs are high as automakers usually only work with one supplier per model per component, and generally bear some of the costs such as tooling and system validation, and deploy engineers to collaborate with suppliers. In case of faulty vehicles, recalls are time-consuming and litigation contingencies can amount to millions of dollars.We think there is no moat on passive components and other smaller subsegments. The company supplies power chokes, sometimes known as high-frequency inductors, mostly for smartphones of a major U.S. consumer electronics company. It enjoys a tight relationship with this customer, having won its trust by supplying reliable desktop and laptop fans and chargers for years before. We estimate Delta supplies 30% of the power chokes used in .U.S. customers' phones, after Taiyo Yudens more than 60%. In recent years, Delta has won new orders from Chinese smartphone brands and Samsung, while five to 10 years later NEV will gradually become the growth driver. Per-distributor data, automotive chokes are worth five times as much as smartphone chokes. We believe potential entrants are few as both Deltas passive component subsidiary (originally operating as a separate listed company) and Taiyo Yuden have decades of reputation and expertise making power chokes, inductors designed for blocking high frequency AC. As smartphones become more powerful, the chokes would be working with stronger currents, which complicates thermal management. While Taiyo and Delta both have strong reputations, there is little preventing smartphone brands, particularly Android players from adopting cheaper workarounds Finally, we assign to a group of smaller subsegments into no-moat ""others,"" such as bundled sales of Vivoteks surveillance equipment and projectors, solar power systems and wind power systems. We think it is difficult to differentiate Vivoteks products from Hikvision and Dahua; or rival the latters partially state-supported scale. The long life cycle of buildings drives a wide moat in automation business. Switching costs play a big role in building automation (aka smart buildings), comprising 5%-6% of top line. We estimate the building automation market is worth over USD 40 billion in 2023, it is made up of several parts, with most emphasis on lighting, water and security surveillance. Delta has a little over 1% market share globally or 2%-3% in China, given it is a latecomer compared with incumbents like Johnson Controls, ABB, Siemens, Schneider and Honeywell. The company maintains service contracts with property management companies after installing sensors, control and monitoring systems, which we estimate to be worth circa 5% of the installation budget each year. As these contracts often last more than a decade, service contracts are slated to contribute about 60% of building automation revenue after 10 years as Delta manages more buildings. We think the businesss stickiness comes from: 1) automation equipment is tightly integrated into building designs--especially for new buildings, refitting such equipment may require an overhaul of utility systems; 2) commercial buildings easily last over 40 years; 3) smartbuilding systems are procured with expected savings and IRRs in mind--estimated at 30% of pre-installation consumption; 4) long mutual learning curve--Delta gains intimate knowledge of buildings under management, which is hard to obtain without on-site access. Building staff like security guards and IT personnel have to relearn building systems; 5) utility stoppages are costly, in the form of rental losses, wasted utility usage, reputational damage, injuries and related compensation; 6) incremental savings from switching are hard to justify, and no savings are realized during refitting. The company has stepped up its control system using Loytecs offerings, which include interfaces, servers and controllers. Both intangible assets and switching costs are moat sources for industrial automation, comprising about 10% of Deltas revenue. We estimate less than 10% of industrial automation revenue is related to service and maintenance, which results in a narrower moat than building automation. The company has about 6% market share in China, slightly behind Shenzhen Inovance, ABB, and Yaskawa. Deltas systems consist of servo motors, variable frequency drives, or VFDs, robotic arms and other components. Deltas VFDs and other industrial components are sold as systems to food, weaving, heavy lifting, elevators, plastic, printing and electronics sectors and so on. Downtime on production may be quite costly for manufacturers as all in-progress products have to be disposed of, and manufacturers may also suffer from the opportunity loss while detecting the problem and restoring production to previous levels. Moreover, manufacturers are usually reluctant to switch suppliers, as automation systems are usually customized and deeply integrated into production/operating systems, playing a critical role for the operation. Like other robotics companies, Delta collects customer operational data from customers, putting it in a better position to offer tailored upgrades and services as feedback. Moreover, mutual learning curves mentioned in building automation also apply in industrial automation. On the software side, Deltas systems help customers monitor, connect and analyze production systems. We think Deltas approach in developing software in-house and acquiring targets to fill the technical gaps is better, as exclusive in-house development can be slow while relying on acquisitions may compromise consistency.","We assign Delta Electronics a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium.Deltas operations are diversified, as it sells different types of power supply products to multiple sectors. Its main exposures are consumer electronics, home appliances, NEVs, renewable energy, industrial automation and property management. Hence, we think Deltas financial performance should not be as volatile as other industrial or technology companies. The company has only experienced one earnings decline of over 20% in the past 10 years.Client concentration is not an issue for Delta. We believe the largest customer orders laptop chargers and smartphone passive components from Delta, contributing just under 10% of revenue. Due to recent growth in NEVs and data centers, we expect the company's clientele to further diversify into automakers, internet giants, and enterprises from many industries that are eager to reduce energy consumption of their data center or server systems.Delta faces currency exposures, mostly THB, CNY, USD, EUR against TWD. DET operates in THB and procures 70% of its raw materials from China. Most of Deltas sales are made in USD or EUR. Purchases may be made in CNY or USD. Most research and development and other supporting operations are based in Taiwan, hence using TWD.We cannot verify who controls Deltas two largest shareholders Deico International, or Deico, and Deltron Holding, or Deltron. These facts do not seem to trouble investors. The chairman of DET, NG Kong Meng is the sole director of Deico, therefore controlling 10.3% of the company. Deltron owns 8.4% of Delta, but there is no way to know who the director(s) is/are. Given his role in DET and Deico, we think Ng can exert the largest influence in Deltas shareholder meetings. It is very likely that Deico and Deltron are passive investors, as they do not hold board seats.","We rate Delta Electronics' Capital Allocation as Standard. The companys balance sheet is sound, as it has maintained a net cash position for most of the past 10 years. We believe future acquisitions and more aggressive expansion in NEVs and automation can be financed by its cash-generative business such as power supplies and automation, which means a turn into net debt should be mild should it occur.Deltas recent acquisitions have been beneficial to shareholders and we look favorably on the company's recent moves to improve capital efficiency by borrowing more money to fund acquisitions and investments. Up to October 2023, Delta has issued TWD 17.5 billion in either three-year of five-year bonds. Issuances in 2023 all pay less than 2% coupon. We think Delta can afford to take more gearing as it has diversified its business into different verticals like PCs, electric vehicles, data centers and automation. We expect Delta to acquire new targets every year to augment its software systems, and each acquisition should cost less than USD 200 million.In February 2023, Delta paid TWD 950 million to acquire a 55% stake in Atrust Computer. The deal may complement Delta's ability to offer remote monitoring solutions.In July 2022, Delta paid USD 92.4 million to acquire Universal Instruments Corporation, or UIC. The deal complements the company's current portfolio in industrial automation, especially in printed circuit boards.In October 2021, Delta paid USD 114 million to acquire Canada-based Infinova. We think the deal makes sense, as it complements Delta's offerings in its listed subsidiary Vivotek, which supplies surveillance cameras, and its automation segment.In November 2020, Delta paid TWD 886 million to complete the acquisition of Canadas Trihedral Engineering in order to strengthen its monitoring systems. The main merit of the deal is to gain exposure in water processing customers, while improving the companys monitoring software.We believe the most important series of acquisitions is related to building automation. From 2016 to 2019, Delta acquired Netherlands-based Delta Controls, Austrias Loytec, 49.2% of Taiwans Vivotek and U.S.-based Amerlux. Vivotek provides surveillance and display projection equipment. Amerlux is a lighting company. These acquisitions each provide a portion of a smartbuilding system, and by integrating them into Deltas proprietary visualization tools, we think it may greatly help capture the potentially wide-moat building automation market.Deltas distributions are just right in our view, with historical payout ratios averaging 60%. Our only advice is the company could consider a special dividend to distribute excess cash or invest some of the net cash more aggressively, like in Chinas automation sector. Delta has distributed dividends for over 20 consecutive years, and we believe future cuts are less likely as Deltas business has become more diversified and resilient.","Founded in 1971, Delta Electronics, or Delta, is the largest industrial power system supplier globally. It positions itself as a solutions provider in telecom power, renewable energy, surveillance systems, new energy vehicles power systems, smart building, industrial automation, and data centers. Delta also trades under Innergie, Loytec, Delta Controls and Amerlux. The company's headquarters are in Taipei, Taiwan, and employs over 11,000 people in 30 countries. A group of Deltas subsidiaries consolidated under Delta Electronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited, or DET, is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. DET is 63.1% owned by Delta. The company owns 56.75% of surveillance system provider Vivotek (3454 TW).","Delta has maintained net cash before accounting for short-term investments at the end of the past 10 years, and every quarter since the end of 2019. Its gross margin has been trending up for the past decade, from 24.5% in 2012 to 28.8% in 2022. We think this reflects management making accretive acquisitions and innovating in the right direction. However, operating margins have ranged from 8% to 11% from 2012 to 2022, which suggests integration of acquisition targets is incomplete, mounting costs of differentiation amid stagnant consumer electronics shipments.Delta allocates about 8% of revenue in research and development annually. We expect spending will continue to approximate the upper limit in the next five years as Delta transitions into a solution provider in renewable energy, electric vehicles, or EVs, data centers and automation. According to a UDN interview, Deltas CEO mentioned the 10-year plan that involves growing EV-related revenue to over USD 3 billion and industrial automation to over USD 5 billion.We expect capital expenditure is budgeted at over TWD 25 billion in 2023 and over TWD 20 billion in 2024. The money is planned for new capacity in China, Taiwan, India and Thailand. These two countries are required to maintain Deltas growth and hedge political risks. We project 2022 to 2026 capital expenditures to be about 6% of sales. We expect little external financing is required, as our projections are equivalent to under 60% of our EBITDA forecasts.Dividend payments have been consistent up to 2021. 2022 dividends increased 79% year on year to TWD 9.84 per share due to changes in reserves (other than retained earnings). As a result, management decides to simplify its dividend policy to distributing no less than 50% net profit for the year.",2308.TW,Technology,832511606784.0,TAI,3879750.0,TWD,312.5,True,0,330.03614457831327,302.0194805194805,0
25/11/2023,"Raising Our Valuation of Pernod, As Margin Improvement Is Looking More Durable",Pernod Ricard SA,RI,4,20/10/2023,Philip Gorham,167.3,EUR,23/11/2023,185.0,Low,Wide,Standard,,20/10/2023,"Pernod Ricard reported a decline in volume in the first quarter, but guidance for growth in the full year suggests that management believes underlying demand remains reasonably strong, and that growth will return once Pernod cycles a strong performance in the first half of last year. We reiterate our wide moat rating and EUR 185 fair value estimate and there was around 11% upside to our valuation at the close of trading on Oct. 19. However, industry volume of spirits, which sell at a higher price point than some other alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine, have historically been more cyclical than other consumer product categories, so developments in the global macroeconomy will be key to unlocking that valuation upside in the next year or so. First-quarter revenue declined organically by 2% year over year on an organic basis to EUR 3.0 billion, a sharp sequential reversal from the 19% increase in the fourth quarter of last year. However, the company was cycling a strong first quarter a year ago, and the two-year stacked organic growth rate of 13% remains above our medium-term expectations. Volume declined by 9%, mitigated by 7% price/mix. No margin data was provided, but this strong pricing seems likely to be sufficient to offset cost inflation. The volume decline was concentrated in two important markets, with organic net sales growth in both the U.S. and China being down 8%. Europe was better, with organic growth up 1%. Management reiterated mid-term guidance of 4%-7% organic net sales growth and provided fairly vague guidance for fiscal 2024. The company expects broad-based organic net sales growth, implying a robust recovery in the remainder of the year, and an improved operating margin. While investors will be relieved in the bullish expectations for the rest of the year, and guidance is consistent with our forecasts, much will depend on the continued spending power of consumers next year.","Pernod has a strong presence in some fast-growth emerging markets, and has labeled both China and India as ""must win"" markets. Underlying pricing power remains relatively strong in spirits and is driving above-average organic growth, and we believe this is due to the conspicuous nature of consumption and the frequency of gifting as a purchase occasion. Although some of Pernods categories are relatively small, the niche nature of categories in which Malibu operates, for example, means that competition is often limited.","Premium spirits are more cyclical than most other consumer staples categories, including beer, and volumes can suffer slightly steeper declines in economic downturns. Recent heavy regulatory intervention in Russia, China, and India are examples of the influence of government policy on the economics of the alcoholic beverage industry. Wine is a highly fragmented and competitive industry, in which pricing power is limited. Pernods greater exposure to the category than competitors gives it some revenue diversification, but may also weigh on its price-led growth in the medium term.",14/03/2023,"Pernod Ricard, formed in 1975 through the merger of two French aniseed liqueur makers by the same names, has established itself as the world's number-two distiller through a series of acquisitions. Although the industry is fairly concentrated (we estimate a four-firm concentration ratio of 0.6, above many other fast-moving consumer goods categories, including the global brewing industry at 0.5), we believe there is more consolidation to come. Outside of the top five firms, the industry is highly fragmented, with local players often dominating in niche product categories or narrowly defined geographies. These firms present a new wave of merger opportunities for the industry consolidators--including Pernod--to strengthen their presence in emerging markets. Volume in the spirits industry is fairly stable (albeit more cyclical than beer), but trends in the industry are transient, providing another incentive for acquisitions. For example, the current shift away from white spirits (mainly vodka) to brown spirits is a reversal of the trend in the 1990s. The breadth of Pernod's portfolio across categories, with both global strategic and local niche brands, mitigates some of the risk to volume from shifting consumer preferences, and its Jameson Irish whiskey brand is certainly on trend at present. Nevertheless, its product range is narrower than that of Diageo, and bourbon and tequila are examples of underindexing in Pernod's portfolio. We believe premiumization will be a long-term tailwind for the global distillers. In developed markets, spirits are taking share from beer and wine as consumers trade up. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, the distilled spirits category has added an average of around 20 basis points of share of throat from other categories every year for the past decade. A continuation of that trend could support Pernod's volume in mature markets, despite an underlying headwind of falling alcohol consumption. In emerging markets, however, trading up is occurring within, rather than between, categories, although cognac in China is likely to remain a key growth driver for Pernod in the medium term.","We believe Pernod Ricard has a wide economic moat, with intangible assets creating material barriers to entry in some of the companys biggest categories, supported in some matured product categories by a cost advantage. Competitive advantages vary by category, and while some have been vulnerable to new entrants in recent years, we feel the spirits industry is generally more protected from the recent surge of new entrants than most other consumer staples industries. The requirement for age verification at the point of sale has limited the growth of the e-commerce channel, a facilitator of new entrants in other categories, while hard discounters share and volumes of private label spirits are minuscule.Intangible AssetsThe intangible asset moat source is most prevalent in categories in which the product is aged. Pernods largest matured products by volume is scotch whisky (27% of fiscal 2021 strategic international brand volume), which must be aged by at least three years, Irish whiskey (15% of strategic international brand volume), which must be aged at least three years, and cognac (5%), which must be aged for at least two years. The intangible asset competitive advantage of aged spirits lies in the pricing power that these products possess. There is a scarcity value to matured spirits, as the bulk of annual production is bottled for mainstream consumption within a few years, and because of the evaporation of the alcohol in the barrel over time, known as the angels share. The longer the maturing process, the higher the scarcity value and the higher the retail price. Consumers also perceive the aging process to improve the taste and the texture of the beverage. This may have some truth in it because the wood from the barrels in which a whisky is aged, for example, can break down the alcohol and provide a smoother taste. Brand loyalty tends to be higher in consumer product categories where real product differentiation is available, or at least where the perception of product differentiation is high, as is the case in aged spirits. Brand equity remains a source of competitive advantage that does not necessarily manifest as a price premium over competitors, but the ability to premiumize consumers through the price ladder within a brand family. In practice, even the large mainstream brands are aged well beyond the minimum requirement. The most popular line of Chivas Regal, one of Pernods blended Scotch whiskies is aged for 12 years, while high-end cognac Martell Millesimes 1972 is aged for 43 years. Even allowing for pricing differentials between blended and single malt Scotch whiskies and within those categories across brands, there is a correlation between the maturity period and the price. Significantly, we believe margins to the manufacturer improve as consumers move up the price ladder. In an inflationary environment, raw material costs are lower for aged spirits because of the accounting matching principle, although this is mitigated by storage and other costs such as additional labor, as well as less economies of scale, but this is more than made up by the price premium for aged finished goods.We regard Pernods non-aged portfolio as being fairly strong but operating in niche categories. For example, Malibu is the world's leading coconut-flavored rum, and Ricard is the largest aniseed-based spirit. However, these are second-tier categories that have lower churn in the on-premise and command less shelf space in off-premise channels than more popular categories such as scotch and vodka. In addition, the liqueur category has failed to gain much popularity outside its core markets in Southern Europe. Even Irish whiskey, a category that Pernod has achieved remarkable growth in recent years, has minuscule share outside Anglo-Saxon markets.Although the pricing power in these categories may be more limited, in aggregate, their presence in the portfolio creates a competitive advantage, particularly in the on-trade. Given the matrix of product categories and price segments that licensed premises must stock, it can simplify the supply chain to have as many products as possible supplied by a single vendor. With dominant brands in niche categories, such as Malibu, Pernod is a top tier vendor for most on-premise customers, a platform from which it can leverage sales in the rest of its portfolio.Cost AdvantagePernod can produce its scale brands at a lower average cost than most of its competitors as well as potential new entrants. Economies of scale are derived from the procurement of raw materials such as barley, maize, wheat, and grapes across multiple categories. Scale also helps to create distribution synergies. As the world's number-two player with 17% global volume market share according to Impact Databank, but behind Diageos 27%, Pernod's scale gives it greater pricing power in its procurement of raw materials than its smaller competitors in regional markets. However, we are skeptical of the value of economies of scale as a competitive advantage that maintains excess returns on invested capital in the distillation industry, because independent distilleries usually compete on product differentiation rather than price. In other words, small brands can command a price premium, depending on the consumers perception of product quality. For example, according to our sample data, The Macallan 12, a Speyside single malt Scotch marketed by privately owned Edrington Group achieves a 50% premium to Pernods comparable 12-year-old single malt, The Glenlivet. This appears to more than offset the disadvantage of the relatively low scale economies of The Macallan, the smaller brand. Volumes of The Glenlivet were close to double those of The Macallan in 2018, according to GlobalData, at 46 million liters and 28 million liters respectively. Nevertheless, PitchBook data shows that the Edrington Group generated a healthy operating margin of at or close to 30% over the last five fiscal years, higher than Pernods adjusted consolidated margin of 25% over the same period. It is not possible, from the PitchBook data, to measure ROIC precisely using Morningstars methodology, but our back-of-the-envelope estimate puts the Edrington Groups ROIC at roughly 15%, slightly above that of Pernod. This is a strong indication that scale does not necessarily lead to a cost-based competitive advantage in spirits, an industry where pricing power is the more powerful driver of value-creation.A stronger argument for a cost advantage, in our view, is the barrier to entry caused by maturing inventory costs. The time lag in monetizing investment in PP&E and multi-year storage costs can make it difficult for new entrants to raise capital. As an alternative to making up-front investments in a distillery, new entrants could produce spirits using a contract packing agreement with an existing distiller, so costs would be limited to production and storage, which still result in several years of costs before any revenue is generated. In addition, share loss to a co-packing partner is less damaging to the returns on capital of the large cap distillers because they take a slice of the profit for the volumes they produce in a co-packing arrangement. It is perhaps for these reasons that most new entrants have so far been limited to non-aged categories such as gin and vodka. Having said that, the revenue lag is not an insurmountable barrier to entry, and new scotch supply will come online in the coming years. In 2018, for example, Hunter Laing & Co. began scotch distillation runs in a new facility named Ardnahoe Distillery--Islays ninth--in late 2018, so may commercialize the first casks beginning in 2022. On balance, we think the high up-front costs, the revenue lag, and particularly for scotch, the finite access to land and water in areas amenable to production, provide a modest cost advantage that will restrict, but probably not eliminate, new entrants to the scotch category. To put into context the industry structure, there were 142 scotch distilleries as at January 2023, according to the Scotch Whisky Association, just 1.5% of the 9,247 craft breweries in the U.S. alone at the end of 2021 (Brewers Association), a category that is only four times the size of scotch by value. Scotch represented 21% of Pernods international brand volume in fiscal 2022.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Pernod Ricard is Low, and we see a slowdown of economic growth as the firm's greatest risk. Distilled spirits is a more cyclical industry than some consumer staples industries, including brewing, and is more closely tied to economic growth. We estimate the correlation between growth in GDP per capita and the spirits industry's retail value to be 0.8, but we estimate a correlation of only 0.3 between GDP per capita and retail beer sales.Trends come and go in the spirits business. There is currently a shift toward brown spirits, which has benefited Pernod's cognac sales in China, while a recent boom in flavored vodkas was short-lived. The gaps in Pernod's product portfolio represent risks to volumes in the event of unfavorable trends emerging.Foreign exchange rates are a risk to most multinational businesses, and Pernod does not actively hedge its operational cash flows against currency movements. At the end of fiscal 2022, however, around 37% of Pernod's net debt was U.S. dollar-denominated, giving the firm's earnings a natural hedge against changes in the euro-dollar rate.Pernod also faces some ESG risks, although we believe they are limited in probability of occurrence and materiality. Health and wellness trends suggest that over time, fewer consumers may be consuming alcohol. Unlike the beer industry, in which the emergence of low- and no-alcohol beer categories at margins above core beer brands should ensure that such a development is limited in its financial impact, this is a more material risk for distillers such as Pernod. Consumer pushback against certain packaging remains a risk, although brewers use few PET materials in their packaging, and packaging of beer cans and bottles are both recyclable. Finally, the risk of raw material shortages, including fruit and water, would have limited financial impact on Pernod. We estimate both of these inputs represent a low-single-digit percentage of cost of goods sold.","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Pernod Ricard, although it has taken an activist investor to nudge Pernod to bring its capital allocation policies in line with its peers. The firm has paid some rich multiples for its acquisitions, including the eye-popping 21 times trailing EBITDA it paid for Vin & Spirit in 2008. The jewel in the crown of V&S was the Absolut vodka brand, a premium product in a category that has contracted on a global volume basis since the acquisition. We believe Absolut has so far been dilutive to returns on invested capital, with its volume having underperformed those of Pernod's other top 14 brands, despite an above-average investment in advertising expenditure and a failed strategy of raising price points. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that management is a good executor. It has built a strong cognac business in China, and the performance of Jameson in recent years has been outstanding, forcing Diageo to temporarily exit the Irish whiskey category in 2014.On the other hand, Pernod's acquisitive strategy has created a strong business with an economic moat, making the company a solid competitor to industry leader Diageo. The firm has delivered double-digit total shareholder returns over the past decade, and has often outperformed Diageo in recent years. Until recently, management showed little inclination to repurchase shares, preferring to allocate capital to acquisitions, and we think this strategy, together with a high degree of financial leverage, has at times caused management to miss opportunities to create value through share-buyback programs. Meanwhile, we think the resumption of the share repurchase program comes at a time when the stock is slightly overvalued and appears to be more of a reaction to activist shareholders' demands rather than an attempt to create long-term value.","Pernod Ricard is the world's second-largest spirits maker by volume, behind Diageo. The firm's key markets are Europe, the United States, and Asia. Pernod's key spirits brands include Absolut vodka, Beefeater gin, Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet scotch whisky, Jameson Irish whiskey, Malibu rum, and Martell cognac. The firm's strategic wine portfolio, which represented around 5% of fiscal 2022 revenue among the group's focus brands, includes Jacob's Creek, Brancott Estate, Campo Viejo, Mumm, and Perrier-Jouet.","Pernod has increased its leverage over time in conjunction with its consolidation strategy, and net debt/EBITDA has risen from a low of 1.3 times in fiscal 2009 to 3 times at the end of fiscal 2022, which puts leverage toward the high end of peers. We expect debt reduction to be the primary near-term priority for capital allocation. In the absence of acquisitions, we believe Pernod can reduce its net debt/EBITDA ratio to around 2.0 times by 2024.Under pressure to return capital to shareholders from activist investor Elliott Capital, Pernod announced its first share-repurchase program in August 2019, and will buy back up to EUR 750 million during fiscal 2023. Simultaneously, management's new dividend policy is to pay out 50% of earnings, up from around 35% before the pandemic, bringing the dividend payout essentially into line with Pernod's peer group. Management has disclosed that the capital allocation priorities are investment in organic growth, mergers and acquisitions, dividend payments and share buybacks, while maintaining an investment-grade rating, a policy we agree with. However, bolt-on acquisitions had accelerated in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Pernod adding assets including Castle Brands, Firestone & Robertson, and Rabbit Hole in 2019 alone. The two largest distillers command a combined volume market share of just 44%, with the remainder quite fragmented, so we expect further consolidation, with Pernod and Diageo at the forefront of merger activity.",RI.PA,Consumer Defensive,39525842944.0,PAR,52959.0,EUR,168.3000030517578,True,1,172.9794869258448,154.35252987046508,0
24/11/2023,Crane Continues to Drive Strong Revenue Growth and Margin Expansion,Crane Co,CR,2,24/10/2023,Krzysztof Smalec,108.85,USD,24/11/2023,92.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,24/10/2023,"We are raising our fair value estimate for narrow-moat-rated Crane to $92 per share from $87 after the company reported strong third-quarter results. Management increased its full-year guidance for the third time this year and now anticipates 2023 core sales growth of 6%-8% (up from 5%-7%) and adjusted EPS of $4.05-$4.20 (up from $3.80-$4.10). The fair value estimate adjustment reflects our slightly higher near-term revenue growth and operating margin projections. Crane increased third-quarter core sales 9.3% from the prior-year period. Aerospace and electronics core sales increased 23.6% year over year, fueled by a strong demand environment in the commercial and defense end markets, while process flow technologies core sales were up 4.8%. Crane's adjusted operating margin expanded 340 basis points year over year, from 11.8% to 15.2%. This strong third-quarter performance reaffirms our long-term thesis that both of Cranes core platforms are poised to benefit from favorable secular trends. We project long-term core sales growth in the high single digits in aerospace and electronics and midsingle digits in process flow technologies. Furthermore, we expect both segments to see strong margin expansion driven by volume leverage, productivity initiatives, and favorable mix shift. Crane announced the acquisition of Baum for roughly $91 million, reflecting a multiple of around 10 times 2023 adjusted EBITDA. The acquisition will bolster the process flow technologies segment's chemical business, and we view it as consistent with Cranes strategy of focusing on higher-growth end markets. Following the acquisition, Cranes net leverage ratio stood at only around 0.2 times, which we believe positions the company well to continue deploying capital into mergers and acquisitions.",Crane owns a portfolio of moatworthy businesses that enjoy leading share in niche end markets. We think the aerospace and electronics segment has established a wide moat based on customer switching costs and intangible assets. Crane has transformed its process flow technologies portfolio toward higher-margin and faster-growing end markets.,"We expect the company to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, and poor execution of its M&A strategy could destroy shareholder value. Cost inflation, tariffs, and persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on the firm's profitability. Following the separation, Crane is a smaller company; this might constrain its ability to pursue acquisitions.",24/10/2023,"Following the separation of the payment and merchandising technologies business as Crane NXT in April 2023, Cranes portfolio consists of the aerospace and electronics, process flow technologies, and engineered materials segments. We think Crane owns a portfolio of moaty businesses that tend to be leaders in their niche markets, typically holding the number-one or -two market share position. Crane manufactures highly engineered products that often perform a mission-critical function. Roughly 40% of its sales come from the aftermarket. We believe that Crane, which continues to be led by CEO Max Mitchell, is well positioned to capitalize on a continued economic recovery, as many of its end markets remain below pre-COVID-19 peak levels. Management pegs the long-term core revenue growth rate at 4%-6% (including 7%-9% in aerospace and electronics and 3%-5% in process flow technologies). We believe that aerospace and electronics is poised to capitalize on a continued cyclical recovery in commercial aerospace, as the end market remains below pre-COVID-19 peak levels. We also think that process flow technologies will benefit from new product introductions as well as a portfolio shift toward higher-growth end markets, including pharma, wastewater, and industrial automation. Following the separation, Cranes net leverage ratio will be roughly 0.5 times pro forma EBITDA, positioning the firm well to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We expect Cranes capital allocation to focus primarily on M&A to expand the aerospace and electronics and process flow technologies platforms. Managements long-term vision includes reaching around $4 billion in sales and mid-20s segment EBITDA margin in 2028, compared with around $1.8 billion in sales and roughly 20.5% segment EBITDA margin expected in 2023.","We assign Crane a narrow moat rating. Following the separation from Crane NXT, the firms portfolio consists of two strategic platforms, aerospace and electronics and process flow technologies, as well as the engineered materials business. Both of Cranes strategic platforms benefit from customer switching costs and intangible assets. Given that many of its products are used in mission-critical applications where the margin for error is slim (for instance, wastewater pumps or brake control systems used on airplanes), Cranes reputation for quality and reliability is a key source of competitive advantage. Over decades, Crane has established long-lasting customer relationships and built a large installed base of equipment that generates recurring revenue, with roughly 40% of sales coming from aftermarket parts and services. While we believe that the aerospace and electronics segment has a wide moat given the long-term duration of contracts that is typical in the aerospace end market, we view the process flow technologies segment as a narrow-moat business and the engineered materials segment as a no-moat business, resulting in an overall narrow moat rating for the company.Aerospace and electronics is Cranes most profitable segment, and we believe it has carved a wide moat. The cornerstones of Cranes moat in the segment are intangible assets, as a reputation for quality and reliability is imperative to win business in the aerospace end market because of the inherent high cost of failure. For example, Crane manufactures sensors and landing gear that play an important role in aircraft safety. Considering that ultimately human lives are at stake, suppliers are held to the highest standards. Furthermore, the aerospace and electronics segment differentiates itself by offering highly engineered solutions designed to operate in harsh environments, such as its DC-DC power converters used in NASAs Mars Perseverance rover.The aerospace business has high barriers to entry due to the long-term nature of business relationships. For example, after winning a contract, Crane might go through a five-year development program for a new aircraft, which will then typically run for around 20 years. Even after the end of a run, the aircraft will often continue to generate aftermarket sales for another 20 years. As such, Crane can provide OEM and aftermarket products for over 40 years on a typical program in the commercial aerospace business. Thanks to its strong record and decades of experience in the business, Crane enjoys strong relationships with all major original equipment manufacturers, including Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Comac. In fact, Cranes antiskid brake control systems have been used in all of Boeings commercial aircraft that are currently in operation.Aftermarket sales, which account for roughly 30% of sales in the segment, generate a relatively stable and high-margin stream of recurring revenue that helps shield the firm from cyclicality. We view the aerospace and electronics segments moat as wide as we believe that it would be difficult for rivals to displace Crane, considering the firms multidecade relationships with key OEMs, large installed base of equipment, and wins on new programs.We believe that the process flow technologies segment has established a narrow moat based on intangible assets, including its engineering capabilities and reputation for quality, as well as customer switching costs associated with its large installed base of equipment.Process flow technologies manufactures pumps, valves, and sensing solutions that often perform a mission-critical function and are used in applications that require high reliability (for example, valves used in the wastewater, chemical, and pharmaceutical end markets). Crane manufactures highly engineered products that are designed to operate in harsh environments, handle corrosive or abrasive substances, offer superior energy efficiency, and reduce unplanned downtime. Customers are often risk-averse and tend to stick with the incumbent supplier because reliability and safety are paramount and any product failures could result in costly downtime. These considerations drive long-term customer attachment, so Cranes large installed base drives a resilient and high-margin aftermarket revenue stream, which accounts for roughly half of the process flow technologies segments sales.We view engineered materials as a no-moat business. The unit manufactures fiberglass-reinforced plastic panels used in recreational vehicles, trucks, and other applications. While we dont see evidence of customer switching costs, we think the business differentiates itself through product quality, new product introductions (including new colors and new formulations), and customer service. Additionally, the engineered materials business enjoys leading share in relatively small niche markets, which could make it challenging for new entrants to match Cranes scale and cost efficiency. That said, we view it as a noncore business, and we are not convinced that the segment is more likely than not to continue outearning its cost of capital over the next 10 years.","We assign Crane a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. As a diversified industrial company, Crane is exposed to the overall health of the global economy, including a potential slowdown in industrial production and GDP growth as well as cyclicality in its end markets. Other possible negatives include cost inflation, tariffs, and research and development spending failing to generate successful new products.We think the largest and potentially most material environmental, social, and governance risks for Crane include failure to comply with various environmental as well as health and safety laws, and potential product quality and safety failures that could expose the company to product liability lawsuits.","We assign Crane a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment of the companys balance sheet, management's investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We think that Crane has a sound balance sheet, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of around 0.5 times following the separation of Crane NXT. We see management's investment history as fair, and we have no reason to expect future investments to be either materially value accretive or destructive. We view Crane's shareholder distributions as appropriate.Crane continues to be led by Max Mitchell, who became president and CEO at Crane Holdings in 2014 after serving as president of fluid handling and chief operating officer since he joined the company in 2004. Before that, Mitchell held a variety of leadership roles at Pentair and Danaher. During his tenure, the company has consistently delivered solid double-digit returns on invested capital and midteens operating margins, and we think Crane is in capable hands.Management has indicated that it will prioritize organic growth and M&A as well as expanding the dividend while allocating excess capital to repurchasing shares. Crane currently pays an $0.18 quarterly dividend. We expect that the company will grow the dividend roughly in line with earnings over the next five years, maintaining a payout ratio of around 20%-25%. The company has a solid record of boosting growth through M&A without eroding operating margins or returns on invested capital. Management's criteria for evaluating acquisitions include a 10% ROIC by year five.","Crane is a diversified industrial firm that manufactures a broad range of products, including valves, pumps, aerospace components, and fiberglass-reinforced plastic panels. Its business is organized into three segments: aerospace and electronics, process flow technologies, and engineered materials. Crane generated approximately $2 billion in revenue in 2022.","We think Crane is on solid financial footing. Following the separation of Crane NXT, Crane will have a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio of roughly 0.5 times. The new financing includes a $300 million three-year term loan as well as a $500 million revolving credit line.We project the firm to generate average operating cash flows of around $300 million per year over the next five years. Given its healthy balance sheet and solid cash flow generation, we believe Crane is adequately capitalized to meet its upcoming debt obligations and continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities.",CR,Industrials,6019673088.0,NYQ,222446.0,USD,108.8499984741211,True,0,91.07468207864119,118.4185246723451,1
25/11/2023,Heico Dominates in Independent Aircraft Parts and Is Exposed to Strong Segments of Defense Market,Heico Corp,HEI,3,29/08/2023,Nicolas Owens,173.9,USD,24/11/2023,162.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,29/08/2023,"Heico reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings broadly consistent with our forecast, and our fair value estimate remains $162 per share. While the company reported more sales in the quarter than we expected, cost growth brought profits down much closer to our expectation. We aren't surprised by short-term cost fluctuations in the current operating environment, and we haven't altered our longer-term expectations for the company's gradual margin expansion as it grows. A good chunk of growth will materialize in the company's October quarter as it completed its acquisition of Wencor earlier in August. Wencor is about one quarter Heico's size and its largest acquisition to date. The companies are both established players in the engineering, manufacture, and sales of aerospace parts under the Federal Aviation Administration's parts manufacturer approval regime, with largely complementary catalogs and distribution footprints, and we think the union reinforces Heico's narrow moat.","Heico independently develops replacement parts for highly complex aircraft componentsthe juiciest market segment in aerospace, with a fraction of the required R&D as OEMs. Heico's components for defense products are highly integrated into complex systems, which makes their replacement or substitution difficult and unlikely. Heico has a record of acquiring quality companies at reasonable prices.","Private equity firms have entered the defense supplier market and may push up prices for target companies, which would limit Heico's ability to generate value-accretive inorganic growth. Heico's defense sales depend on U.S. military funding and priorities, which are always subject to change As Heico grows, it may become harder over the long term to maintain ""peaceful relations"" with the OEMs whose parts it copies.",08/08/2023,"Heico exploits the switching costs created by aerospace manufacturers for their spare parts. Aerospace suppliers typically build the hefty research and development costs of developing their products into the prices they charge for servicing and/or replacing that part in the aftermarket. Heico reverse-engineers these complex parts at a fraction of the cost of their original development, gains critical regulatory approval to sell its functionally equivalent parts, and sells them around 30%-40% cheaper than the original. Known in the United States as parts manufacture authority under the FAA's jurisdiction, regulatory approval is critical as most buyers can only buy OEM or PMA certified parts to retain the airworthiness certification of their aircraft. Most operators of newer aircraft stick with OEM parts for a number of reasons (such as long-term service contracts with engine manufacturers or lease terms aimed at preserving the resale value of the aircraft), limiting Heico to make parts for aircraft and systems in later stages of their service life. This business model works on two critical assumptions: no new entrants and rational competition with OEMs. New entrants are limited by the regulatory hurdle and the difficulty and cost of reverse-engineering aerospace components, while Heico enjoys a long track record of successful PMA approvals and safe deployment of its parts. The company has largely avoided irrational competition with OEMs by being selective about the parts it copies and the customers it pursues. Within defense, the company produces niche, small-batch components that are integrated into more complex systems. We look to the massive backlogs at larger defense contractors to buoy sales growth in Heico's defense business.  Heico has been a successful acquirer of smaller businesses, and we see a large, fragmented base of small aerospace and defense suppliers that Heico could purchase and integrate at the right price. In August 2023, Heico bought Wencor for just over $2 billion in cash and stock from a private equity company; Wencor runs a similar PMA business with a parts catalog that largely complements Heico's and is its largest acquisition to date. ","We assign Heico a narrow moat rating based on intangible assets stemming from product complexity and a strict regulatory environment and switching costs stemming from the importance of its products operating correctly and their placement on long-cycle products. Although Heico has very respectable midteens ROICs according to our modeling, and some aspects of its competitive advantage are quite durable, we constrain our moat rating to narrow because its commercial business model is ultimately dependent on a lack of new entry into the PMA market by marginal suppliers and rational competition with OEMs. We do not have enough confidence that both these conditions outside of Heico's control (particularly rational competition with OEMs) would necessarily hold over 20 years to support a wide moat rating.Heico is the largest independent (non-OEM) producer of replacement parts for aircraft and produces niche subcomponents for defense products. As the companys commercial aerospace and defense businesses operate distinct business models, we believe the best way to analyze the company is by end market.Typically, original equipment manufacturers for aviation products sell the original product at a loss or very low margin and make up their massive development costs by exploiting monopolistic pricing power in later maintenance and repair business, dubbed the aftermarket. Heico reverse-engineers engine and aircraft components, gets regulatory approval to sell them as functionally identical to the original, and then competes with OEMs for about 2%-3% share of the overall aftermarket, generally for older planes and engines. Heicos third-party parts are known as parts manufacturer approval parts, or PMAs. Heico also runs its own maintenance, repair, and overhaul shops that allow it to effectively distribute these parts through subcontracted repairs, and the company sells directly to other MRO shops. Heico typically sells at a discount to OEMs, and by our estimate controls the majority of this market. It is important to note that Heico competes with OEMs in a somewhat indirect way, as their business model is focused on gaining as much content as possible on the first two maintenance cycles (roughly the first 12 years of an aircrafts life), whereas Heico focuses almost exclusively on content for the final 10 years of an aircrafts life. This works for customers because the use of PMA parts are seen as destroying the resale value of the aircraft: airlines tend to seek to maintain resale value on younger aircraft by shopping with OEMs and switching to PMAs when maintenance costs become more important on older aircraft. We see intangible assets in the form of product complexity, a stiff regulatory process, and a difficult-to-replicate distribution channel, all of which pose barriers to entry. Most aerospace components are manufactured to exacting standards and must be tested individually to show they meet those standards. The regulatory process, which enforces these specifications, can take years, and the Federal Aviation Administration scrutinizes entrants more than incumbents. A new or marginal entrant would eventually need to replicate hundreds of parts to present a viable parts catalog and gain entry to the repair and maintenance marketplace; the incremental cost of integrating a new/different PMA supplier in a complex maintenance operation would initially at least offset the potential savings on a part.Heico reverse-engineers very small niche components in commercial engines and aircraft. The difficulty of replicating technology can be seen in the time required to develop an engine, as it took nearly 20 years for Pratt & Whitney to develop the geared turbofan engine. It usually takes 10 years and millions of dollars of consistent research and development before Heico begins earning material revenue off an aircraft or engine platform, and the firm cites its R&D expenditure as a source of competitive advantage. We think that the time and effort required for another supplier to enter this market is a steep enough barrier that most would-be competitors are not willing. Heico is dominant in the global PMA market, supplying about half of all third-party spare parts for the commercial aftermarket, which we think is tangible evidence of the barrier to entry in action. Heico also runs the largest independent MRO shop, which gives it a distribution network for its parts, which would be expensive and difficult to replicate. This integrated MRO shop makes it much easier for Heico to place these parts with airlines and allows Heico to sell its products. The difficulty of generating a broad parts portfolio and a distribution network that allows Heico to consistently sell its parts reinforces its intangible asset base. Switching costs come from a highly risk-averse customer base with complex maintenance operations. Airlines face substantial cost of failure, and Heico has a 30-year record of never having a part fail in flight, which is difficult to replicate and likely makes airlines substantially more willing to use Heico parts as spares rather than those from other, smaller PMA suppliers. Heico alone serves over half the PMA market in terms of parts volume, and Lufthansa holds a 20% stake in HEICO's Aerospace operation, which is a vote of confidence in the company from a major global airline.We see switching costs from the requirement that airlines have properly maintained aircraft to perform the core function of their business. Airlines must maintain aircraft to type-certificate standards and must periodically disassemble and reassemble aircraft to check whether wear and tear requires new parts. Airlines cannot forgo this maintenance and must pay the required price to fly passengers on the aircraft. In many cases, the only viable alternative for Heico parts is the OEM part, which is generally much more expensive as OEMs use monopolistic pricing to cover the substantial R&D required to create the initial part.The second switching cost is the long-cycle nature of the products Heico sells replacement products for. Many commercial aircraft engines have decades of production and are used for decades after the product is out of production. For example, International Aero Engines V2500 engine had its first run in 1987 and is still used to power A320s because it is generally more economical for airlines to repair an engine than to purchase a new engine and fit it onto an aircraft. This long product cycle is quite common across the aviation industry for aircraft and engine products. The long life of the products that Heico provides spare parts for gives Heico great revenue visibility as it can capitalize development of spare parts over many decades. We think the companys exposure to defense has a wide moat, but this is not enough to apply to the overall firm. Heico produces subcomponents for a variety of defense products, which we think is protected by intangible assets stemming from product complexity, and we see switching costs stemming from a lack of viable alternatives and product placement on more complex, longer-cycle products. We think that Heico benefits from substantial, but not insurmountable, product complexity. While we think a small subset of other defense companies would be able to replicate the laser range finder receivers, electro-optical, microwave, and power equipment Heico produces, we think it would require time and money that they could likely deploy better elsewhere. We think the fact that Heicos products must be able to withstand harsh environments, such as space and high heat, adds to product complexity, but we do not think this is an insurmountable barrier and is common in the defense and aerospace sector. We think switching costs, particularly relating to the mission-criticality of the product, are Heicos primary moat source in its defense exposure. The companys components are well integrated into targeting systems, satellite systems, ships, and aircraft. In some cases, particularly spacecraft, it is prohibitively difficult to repair a subcomponent, which makes customers reluctant to switch to an untested supplier. In many cases, the subcomponent is tied to a critical function of the product, such as a missile targeting system, an aircrafts power system, or a ships communication system, which we think reduces the probability of a customer switching to an alternative supplier.We see switching costs stemming from the time and effort required to switch to an alternative provider as well as product placement on longer-cycle products. While we think large defense primes can replicate the subcomponents that Heico produces, Heico produces a wide variety of small-batch subcomponents that would need to be replicated individually. While in aggregate, this is a highly profitable business, we think the time and effort required to vertically integrate is likely not worth it to defense primes, particularly because of the contract structure for defense contracts. Typically, defense contracts are originally won on a cost-plus basis and then move gradually to a fixed-price nature. At this point, the components, which may represent a small fraction of the cost of the entire system, are well integrated into complex systems that would be prohibitively difficult to re-engineer with new components for tiny incremental bits of margin. While the components themselves may be easy to replicate, the complex systems they are integrated into are not, which we think constitutes a substantial switching cost for the prime contractors.","Heico faces risks related to its end markets, operational performance, and financial risks related to capital allocation. We assign the firm a Morningstar Medium Uncertainty Rating. Commercial aerospace is emerging from its worst downcycle due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and such disruptions are likely to recur in the foreseeable future. Heico's aerospace revenue dropped 32% in 2020 and were flat in 2021 because travel restrictions meant aircraft went through far fewer maintenance cycles than normal.Within its defense markets, the U.S. government is by far the largest end consumer of military products, and in addition to the general political risk involved in the process of defense spending, reprioritization of some programs over others could affect Heicos top line. Heico uses much of its free cash flow to purchase companies. Management has historically delivered strong results from inorganic growth, but it could destroy shareholder value by mispricing a target company or by anticipating efficiencies that are not realized. If Heico were unable to find suitable acquisition targets, its overall growth would suffer.","We think Heico deserves a Standard Capital Allocation Rating notwithstanding its temporarily weak balance sheet, and due to its fair investments and appropriate shareholder distributions.Heico typically uses most of its free cash flow to purchase companies. Through 2022, Heico generated roughly $1.9 billion of cumulative free cash flow and acquired $950 million of companies. In 2023, the company will spend nearly $2.5 billion, primarily on the acquisition of Wencor, a well-established PMA supplier, its largest acquisition to date. Because both Heico's aerospace and defense business lines benefit from durable competitive advantages and are likely to generate returns above their cost of capital for ten years or more, we like the company's investment pattern. As we also expect the prices Heico will have to pay for target acquisitions to trend upwards, we rate the company's investments as fair.As of 2022, two thirds of the company's goodwill was booked in the electronic technologies segment, which is more exposed to the defense market. We think this makes sense, as the defense supply chain is fragmented and replete with valuable intellectual property. Wencor sits more squarely in the aerospace business but also makes sense to us as its product portfolio is complimentary to Heico's, and the two companies operating together will be able to cross-sell their products and introduce them into their respective distribution channels. From our assessment of the companies that Heico acquired and we have financial information for, the company typically pays about 1.5-3 times sales, which is not far out of line from the typical pricing for an aerospace and defense firm. Were pleased to see steady growth in our estimates for the electronic technologies groups ROIC, when including goodwill in invested capital. This indicates that management has been able to acquire companies at reasonable prices or drive value with companies after the purchase. The Mendelson family gained control of Heico in the early 1990s via a leveraged buyout and still retains a substantial proportion of the company. We think that the family is likely to retain control of the company for the foreseeable future. That noted, we think the fact that current management has increased operating income at a 21% compound annual growth rate since 1990 is indicative that management does not need outside shareholder pressure to motivate performance. Lufthansa, a major German airline, has a 20% noncontrolling interest in the firm. Management pays shareholders in the form of semiannual common dividends. Dividends per share grew from $0.07 to $0.18 from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2022. Total dividends over 2017-22 averaged roughly 5% of free cash flow. We think that this dividend is not especially meaningful for smaller shareholders, as the stock typically yields well under 0.5% and is likely in place to offer income to larger shareholders. We do not think it detracts from the companys ability to acquire firms or reinvest in the business.","Heico is an aerospace and defense supplier that focuses on creating niche replacement parts for commercial aircraft and components for defense products. In commercial aerospace, Heico is the largest independent producer of replacement aircraft parts, primarily for engines. In the defense market, the company produces niche subcomponents used in targeting technology as well as simulation equipment, among other things. It operates as two segments: the flight support group,or FSG, and the electronic technologies group, or ETG, both of which supply the aerospace and defense sectors to different degrees. The company is highly acquisitive, focusing on companies in similar or adjacent markets that are generating strong cash flow with the potential for growth.","We think Heico is in a sound financial position. The company carries lower leverage than some peers and continued to generate significant free cash flow even in the depths of the pandemic. It has been able to comfortably close acquisitions during the pandemic using cash on hand without challenging its ability to service obligations. We think the companys ability to continue executing its acquisition-heavy strategy in the worst operating environment for aerospace in history is a strong sign of financial strength.Heico typically carries little debt, with gross debt/EBITDA typically ranging from 1.2 turns to about 1.8 turns over the past five years. In 2021, the firm paid down almost all the debt it raised during the pandemic and gross debt to EBITDA fell to about 0.25 turns. The company generated just over $400 million of cash from operations in 2020, the worst operational year for commercial aviation in history, so we do not expect the firm to face a liquidity crunch given the firm's cash generation and capital structure. The firm has levered up somewhat in 2023 in connection with its acquisition of Wencor, but pledges its net debt/EBITDA should not exceed 3 turns, and will decline soon, well within the tolerance of our forecast.",HEI,Industrials,21453993984.0,NYQ,479172.0,USD,173.89999389648438,True,0,165.70795467601172,183.0058026197488,1
25/11/2023,Optimism on Hikvision Earnings Backed by Chinas Bottoming Economy and Smarter Hardware,Hangzhou Hik-Vision Digital Technology Co Ltd,002415,3,23/10/2023,Phelix Lee,35.81,CNY,24/11/2023,40.5,High,Narrow,Standard,,23/10/2023,"We cut our fair value estimate on Hikvision to CNY 40.50 from CNY 43.00 after increasing operating expense assumptions and reducing nonoperating income. The need to continuously perfect recognition or sensing algorithms for dozens of industries makes costs less flexible than we thought. However, in our view, shares of Hikvision are undervalued, as Chinas economy is showing early signs of recovery, and we do not see any issues with the firms long-term profitability. We expect a steady flow of supportive government policies and the approval of the spinoff of its robotics operations to bolster the share price. We think Hikvision can improve its switching cost moat as it spends more on research and development, primarily on refinement of various algorithms, and their integration into a wide range of hardware. Hikvision excels at integrating hardware with detection algorithms for real-life use cases. One example is a surveillance system that detects and warns children who venture too close to rivers. Such integration across dozens of industries and thousands of products is very costly to replicate, and customers are discouraged from buying hardware separately due to compatibility issues and the extra time spent. While there are many companies offering artificial intelligence services, they focus on generative AI, application of web-content-centric models, or generic model training, which Hikvision does not operate in. We are not bothered by Hikvisions full-year 2023 net profit guidance of CNY 13.5 billion to CNY 14 billion, as most of the CNY 1.5 billion difference compared with our August forecast came from nonoperating items. We have not changed our revenue estimates as we maintain our view that Chinas economy is on track to recovery, backed by an improving purchasing managers index and retail sales data. Hikvision posted third-quarter 2023 results that slightly missed our expectations.","Hikvisions scale will allow it to grab market share from smaller players in a fragmented domestic video surveillance market, driving above-market growth rates. With rising demand for total solutions, Hikvisions unrivaled surveillance camera footprint in China will allow it to bundle storage, software, and ancillary products such as access control and alarms, thereby increasing switching costs. Hikvisions first-mover advantage in the solutions market has enabled it to accumulate deep knowledge across different industry verticals and build better customized solutions.","Deceleration in surveillance camera growth in China as penetration rate peaks and government-led initiatives taper off. Increasing price competition in overseas markets, where Hikvision competes mainly in the low-mid end segment, could put downward pressure on gross margins. Entrance of large information & communication technology, or ICT, players, that have significant financial strength and scale, into AI-enabled video surveillance market could drive stiffer competition.",23/10/2023,"Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology is the worlds largest maker of video surveillance equipment and is the leader in China, which is its biggest and fastest-growing market and accounts for 70% of its revenue. Hikvision was the first domestic player to reorganize its business and offer customized total solutions across different industry verticals. This first-mover advantage has enabled it to accumulate deep industry knowledge and better solutions with higher efficacy. As a result, it has established leading market share across the value chain, from cameras and servers to VMS software, and has delivered attractive ROICs above its peers in China. We believe that Hikvisions dominance across the value chain, especially in software and artificial intelligence platforms, will reinforce switching costs for customers and allow it to outgrow the market at the expense of smaller players with more limited financial resources and product offerings. In the medium term, we expect the nationwide Xueliang project, robust software solution growth, and continued market share gains in China to drive earnings.  Hikvisions management aims to continue to grow its overseas market share, with an emphasis on emerging markets due to restrictions it faces in the U.S. and parts of Europe. It has struggled to displace established system integrators such as Bosch and Honeywell in developed western markets, especially given the increasing concerns around national security. In 2018, Hikvision expanded into the lower-end market, selling to small-medium businesses. We think that Hikvision is able to leverage the scale and cost-advantage that it has built out domestically to keep prices competitive in overseas market. However, in the near term, we expect overseas growth to be achieved at the expense of margins. Subsequently, we assume overall margins to recover as overseas profitability stabilizes and software's contribution to revenue increases.","We assign Hikvision a narrow economic moat. We believe that Hikvision benefits from switching costs in the China video surveillance market, which accounts for 70% of the firms overall revenue. Hikvisions first-mover advantage in the solutions market helped the company to build valuable industry knowledge, better understand customer needs, and foster stronger relationships, enabling the company to provide a better total-solutions-based offering than its competitors, from surveillance cameras and servers to video management software. Hence, we believe that Hikvision's strong ecosystem underpins its switching cost primary moat source. Intangible assets, more specifically Hikvisions state-owned enterprise status and the benefit it derives from that as it pertains to bidding for government projects, represents a secondary moat source, in our view.Besides product design and quality, enterprise and government clients are also concerned about stability of the system, after-sales technical support, and efficacy of the solution provided, making them sticky to Hikvision. Customers will likely incur heavy implicit costs, such as time and resources spent on retraining employees on a new software platform and product and transferring large amounts of data between servers, if they were to overhaul their existing system. For example, a video network of 100,000 cameras would generate approximately 30 petabytes (or 30 million gigabyte) of video data every month. For reference, an average desktop has 1,000-2,000 gigabytes of storage capacity. Hence, switching to a server supplied by a different vendor is a big undertaking that could disrupt business operations. Additionally, it is also more cost-efficient (from a procurement management standpoint) for customers to purchase hardware and software from a single vendor, rather than mix and match products/software from different vendors. Given the idiosyncratic nature of security needs across different industries, enterprises and governments are increasingly seeking customized total solutions across the value chain, from surveillance cameras, video management systems software (VMS) to after-sales technical support. Although Hikvisions VMS software is compatible with hardware from external competitors, there is no reason for customers to replace cameras, servers, VMS, and maintenance service separately, and it will be a huge cost for customers to replace the entire security system, considering that Hikvision provides one-stop total solution and quality offerings across the value chain. Therefore, we believe that Hikvision benefits from switching costs inherent in the ecosystem that it has established.China is the largest global video surveillance equipment market with 44% market share, and it's growing at a four-year CAGR of 13.1% versus 3.5% CAGR for World ex-China. Within Hikvisions China revenue, 70% is derived from direct sales to enterprises and government (35% government and 35% enterprise), while the remaining 30% is via distribution channels that sell primarily to small-medium businesses. China is a relatively fragmented market that is undergoing consolidation. While Hikvision and Zhejiang Dahua combined account for 55%-60% of the video surveillance equipment in China, the remainder of the market is shared by more than 1,000 players, many of which simply do not have the financial and technological resources to provide a one-stop solution. Therefore, we believe that Hikvisions scale and the fragmented nature of Chinas video-surveillance market further reinforce Hikvisions ability to provide superior solutions and after-sales technical support across numerous verticals. Hikvision began transforming its business to a solution-centric model in 2011 by establishing partnerships with end customers and restructuring its salesforce from regional to industry coverage. In contrast, Hikvisions largest competitor, Zhejiang Dahua Technology, began this transformation in 2014. As such, Hikvisions first-mover advantage has allowed it to accumulate valuable knowledge across different verticals and critically understand the needs of customers, thereby enabling it to design superior one-stop solutions with better efficacy. We believe that Hikvisions experience of handling much more data, owing to the larger market share and the lead time, is a key contributor to improving the efficiency of its software, which is critical for security products, and makes it difficult for other players to catch up. Hikvisions solid market share growth and dominant position across the value chain is testament to the first-mover advantage that it enjoys. In fact, Hikvisions market share has grown from an estimated 23.5% in 2013 to over 40% in 2022, which is more than double the market share of its biggest competitor, Zhejiang Dahua Technology. Moreover, the company has over 50% market share in the VMS software market, which supports our view.Hikvisions software is a key enabler of Hikvisions total solution offering. Currently, Hikvision bundles its software together with the solution package that it sells to end customers. The aim is to enhance the stickiness of its brand through greater software penetration, as clients will be more inclined to engage Hikvision for hardware system upgrades. With over 50% market share in the VMS software market in China, Hikvisions footprint is well entrenched in customers operating systems. Unlike competitors spending 7%-8% revenue on R&D, Hikvision has bumped up the ratio to over 10% to counter headwinds from the U.S. and strengthen its AI-based offerings. We estimate that 30%-40% of Hikvisions overall R&D expenditures are allocated to VMS software development. On an absolute basis, Hikvisions R&D expenditure of CNY 9.8 billion in 2022 is significantly higher than domestic peers. We think that Hikvisions vastly higher R&D spending will allow it to defend its leading position in Chinas VMS software market. Hikvisions largest competitor in China, Zhejiang Dahua Technology, offers similar one-stop solutions but on a smaller scale. As highlighted above, Dahua started its transformation two years later than Hikvision into a solution-centric model. This delay has given Hikvision the first-mover advantage to accumulate valuable customer knowledge, vertical know-how, and foster stronger relationships at the expense of Dahua. We think Hikvision is widening its lead by expanding into high-reliability applications like medical devices and industry detection. Key evidence of this is Hikvisions dominant market share (over 50%) in software, which is customized to multiple industry verticals and requires keen understanding of customers needs. In contrast to Hikvision, which has developed its software in-house, Dahua has made a series of acquisitions in the software space to play catch-up with Hikvision. We note that such bolt-on acquisitions also bring about higher integration risks. Smaller competitors such as Shenzhen Gosun, Shenzhen Infinova, and Netposa simply do not have the financial resources and breadth of products to offer total solutions on the same scale as bigger players such as Hikvision. For example, Hikvision offers more than 10,000 different types of cameras/servers in its product lineup. Therefore, we believe that Hikvisions entrenched footprint (in customers operating systems) and established ecosystem have created high barriers of entry and prevented competitors from replicating Hikvisions success.Besides switching costs, we think that Hikvisions status as a state-owned enterprise, or SOE, paves the way for it to bid and be a frontrunner for government and security-related contracts, thereby supporting its intangible asset secondary moat source. China Electronics Technology Group, or CETC, a state-owned defense contractor that supplies radar and space systems, and electronic equipment to the military, has a 41% ownership stake in Hikvision. Hikvision is a key supplier of surveillance systems for large-scale national security projects in China. For example, Hikvision has been deeply involved in surveillance projects in Xinjiang, which has seen the government spent more than USD 1 billion since 2016 to beef up security following terrorist attacks by radicalists in 2014. The firm was mandated to supply advanced cameras with facial recognition technology in mosques and re-education facilities in the province. Hikvision was also tasked with providing security systems for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, as well as the safe city camera project in Chongqing.","We have a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating on Hikvision, largely reflecting its dependence on the economic cycle in China and overseas growth. In China, which accounts for 68% of overall sales, 70% of revenue is tied to enterprises and government, while the remaining 30% is derived from small-medium businesses, or SMBs. We believe that demand from the government associated with safe-city projects has matured, and the next leg of growth will come from enterprise and SMBs. An economic slowdown could lead to a delay in government spending. On the other hand, demand from enterprises and SMBs is more elastic, which could lead private customers to cancel projects or to defer to cheaper products/solutions offered by competitors. The firm derives 32% of its revenue outside China and plans to grow its overseas business, where Hikvision mainly competes on price. Overseas sales receipts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, hence its profitability is exposed to the risk of USD/CNY exchange rate fluctuations. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war is a source of risk to Hikvision profitability, though we believe that the markets concerns are overdone, as U.S. sales account for less than 2% of overall revenue, though we have incorporated the negative spillover effects in our assumptions. From a supply standpoint, Hikvision relies on Huawei for system-on-chip processors. Hence, stricter controls by the U.S. to inhibit Huaweis access to key chip technology could negatively impact Hikvision.Hikvision receives financial support from the government via valued-added tax, or VAT, rebates, subsidies, and tax refunds. Between 2012 and 2022, subsidies made up 10% of the companys net income on average. VAT rebates account for almost 90% of the firms total subsidies. The VAT rebate is a long-term policy that is instituted across various sectors to support domestic exporters, therefore we think that the risk of a complete reversal of this tax rebate is low. ","We rate Hikvisions Capital Allocation as Standard. China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, or CETC, has a 41% ownership stake in the company via its wholly owned subsidiaries such as China Electronics Technology HIK Group (36%) and The 52nd Research Institute at China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (2%). CETC is a state-owned enterprise, or SOE, that engages primarily in military-related technology, such as the manufacturing of military electronic equipment and development of software and systems integration, including the construction of national defense electronics information infrastructure. The second largest shareholder is vice chairman Gong Hongjia, who owns a 10.3% stake and is one of co-founders of the company back in 2001.Hikvision's balance sheet is sound, with a net cash position most of the past 10 years. We applaud this performance, especially considering the company had been stockpiling components to brace for U.S. restrictions and buying time for domestic suppliers to develop replacements. Still, with CNY 19.7 billion net cash as of June 30, 2023, we would like to see management ramp up acquisitions to augment its AI and SaaS tools.Hikvision introduced an employee restricted share scheme where just under 9,973 employees are entitled to subscribe to 99.73 million shares, corresponding to 1.1% of shares outstanding. Shares will vest at the end of the third, fourth, and fifth year after grant, provided Hikvision can maintain 15% revenue year-on-year growth and 20% adjusted ROE in the corresponding years. Given the size of the scheme and number of employees eligible, we think it sufficiently aligns with the interests of shareholders, senior management, and employees. The firm appears mindful of the interests of minority shareholders. It has steadily grown its dividend payout ratio from 27% in 2011 to 51% in 2022, which is consistent with managements policy to distribute between 40% and 50% of its profit annually in future. ","Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology is the worlds largest manufacturer of video surveillance equipment. Since then, the company has been growing its software and analytics offerings, as customers are increasingly seeking customized total solutions. Hikvision is also developing its innovative businesses, which accounted for 18% of overall 2022 revenue. The smart-home business is powered by the EZVIZ consumer brand. Innovative business includes the development of industrial robotics, automotive electronics, X-ray sensors, infrared sensors, memory products and medical systems. Hikvision employs more than 58,000 people.","Hangzhou Hikvision is financially strong and boasts a net cash position of CNY 22.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2023. The firms financial strength is head and shoulders above domestic competitors, largely due to its strong free cash flow generation. For example, free cash to the firm as a percentage of sales has averaged 12% between 2018 and 2022.Gross margin remains healthy and stable from 2015's 44% to 2022's 42.3%. We believe this demonstrates the effectiveness of bundling AI and software-as-a-service tools with surveillance hardware to customers, which in turn leads to Hikvision's products being tightly integrated with customers' operations.",002415.SZ,,,,,,35.849998474121094,True,1,34.886049388374076,33.1718987573557,0
24/11/2023,GQG's Earnings Outlook Remains Good; Shares Undervalued,GQG Partners Inc,GQG,4,03/11/2023,Shaun Ler,1.4,AUD,24/11/2023,2.0,High,,Standard,,03/11/2023,"Our conviction in the thesis for listed wealth managers, asset managers, and their related service providers has strengthened after gathering insights from the recent 2023 Super & Wealth Summit, hosted by the Australian Financial Review. These firms are influenced by similar business drivers and industry trends. Most derive their revenue from funds under management and/or administration, or FUMA, which are driven by asset price movements and new fund flows from clients, and management fees or commissions on these FUMA. Most asset managers and related firms under our coverage are undervalued, with an average discount of 21%. Investors are overly fixated on headwinds that are mainly cyclical while underestimating the potential for improved earnings as business conditions normalize. Fee compression will persist as firms strive to remain competitive when faced with larger rivals like industry super funds that are growing in size through mandated super contributions. We also see ongoing cost-outs as firms keep pace with competition and retain client assets. We also think firms with a diverse product portfolio have a relatively greater ability to attract and retain client assets. We retain our fair value estimates for wealth management providers AMP, Hub24, Insignia, and Netwealth at AUD 1.35, AUD 24.50, AUD 3.40, and AUD 10.10 per share, respectively. Likewise, our fair value estimates for asset managers Challenger, GQG, Magellan, Perpetual, Pinnacle, and Platinum remain at AUD 7.30, AUD 2.00, AUD 9.60, AUD 27.50, AUD 11.00, and AUD 1.90 per share. Lastly, we maintain our fair value estimates for related service providers Iress and Link at AUD 9.20 and AUD 1.50. Among these 12 firms, only Pinnacle, Perpetual, Iress, and Link have narrow economic moats, while the rest have no moat. We favor Insignia among the wealth management providers and prefer Pinnacle, Perpetual, and Challenger among the asset managers. Iress is our pick among the related service providers.","GQGs enviable performance record is supportive of further mandate wins. The firm is better placed than most active managers to withstand fee compression thanks to its highly competitive fee structure. There is further room for GQG to grow earnings. Penetration in certain strategy categories remain low, and its in the early innings of distributing outside the U.S. Its sheer scale of FUM means that earnings can grow from just compounding market returns. ","Shareholders fortunes are largely tied to the efficacy of GQG investing style, which may not always outperform. GQG lacks the fundamental building blocks (like diversity in asset classes and products) that can help it attract and retain FUM more consistently. Key person risk is relatively high at GQG. This is not just in comparison to large scale managers or holding companies, but also other boutique managers. GQGs clients are predominantly institutional and subadvised clients, who are less tolerant of underperformance and can terminate mandates at short notice. ",17/08/2023,"GQG Partners is a boutique manager of listed equities. As of July 2023, GQG manages more than USD 108 billion for institutional, wholesale and subadvised clients. GQG manages global, U.S., ex-U.S., and emerging-market equities. The firm has a blended investment style: It is willing to pay up for quality growth firms, but also holds stocks trading at lower valuation multiples. GQGs portfolios are concentrated and dont resemble their benchmarks. Its strategies tend to outperform more during downturns than in bull markets. The firm is in the early innings of expanding out of its core U.S. market. GQG is growing its distribution in Australia, Canada, and the Middle East. It is particularly focused on exploiting the growth of Australias superannuation system. It also intends to grow its number of wholesale and subadvised mandates. Around 80% of funds under management is U.S.-centred, and less-sticky institutional and subadvised money. Management prioritises organic growth over acquisitions. Rather than proliferating its offerings, GQG would sell new products only when its research efforts can be leveraged, with minimal incremental investment. For example, its concentrated global strategy is a subset of its global equity offering. The firm deliberately undercuts competitors on pricing and boasts below-average fees.  We expect ongoing inflows and compounding of FUM to drive earnings growth. A strong track record, expanding distribution and growing publicity beyond the U.S. are likely to support new business wins. There is ample capacity for the firm to onboard more clients as it mainly invests in large caps. Having bottom-quartile fees means GQG is well positioned to withstand industrywide fee compression relative to other active managers.  However, investors should brace for periods of uneven performance given GQGs portfolio and product concentration. The lack of product variety means GQG has limited levers to stem net outflows. GQG remains highly reliant on co-founder Rajiv Jain, so the group has much to lose if it cannot retain his services.","We believe GQG lacks an economic moat. Its limited product breadth, the replicability of its strategies, personnel concentration risks, and its large exposure to less-sticky institutional and sub-advised money temper our overall enthusiasm. This is despite GQGs competitive fee structure and solid track record, which have thus far generated inflows and favourable fund ratings. However, such attributes can be cyclical, and investors are exposed to downside risks if performance slips or if key personnel are unable to replicate their investment efforts in the future.GQGs limited product variety, and the replicability of its strategies (by active managers and passive vehicles such as ETFs) mean that investor sentiment can easily turn against the firm if it underperforms. The firm prefers to spend most of its time managing money and believes it can outperform over market cycles. We note despite some geographical (Global, U.S., emerging markets) and return (dividend income) variations, its products are limited to listed equity investmentsa common offering that is available from a multitude of fund managers. GQG has largely rejected requests for customised strategies, and would roll out new strategies only when the incremental effort is low for example, when its research efforts can be leveraged. The firm adopts a blended investment style and does not confine itself to a traditional ""value"" or ""growth"" framework. But this is not unique to GQG, with other fund managers also adopting a similarly 'blended' investment approach. Boutique managers such as GQG lack the diversity of funds and strategies possessed by some multi-boutiques (like Pinnacle) or larger-scale asset managers (like Perpetual). For these firms, the diversity in products means that when some strategies underperform, others may outperform. Clients are able to invest between products depending on their risk appetite. On the other hand, its difficult for a pure vanilla, listed equity manager to outperform consistently. GQGs specialisation in a growth-oriented, valuation-conscious investment strategy means should this style underperform or fall out of favour, there is no alternative offering that investors can reinvest in within GQG (and thus keep their money with GQG). Morningstars manager research team has noted Chief Investment Officer Rajiv Jain tended to outperform in downturns while typically lagging during periods of market strength. For instance, for the 12 months to May 31, 2021, GQGs Global Equity strategy lagged the strong rebound in equity markets as Jain rotated out of overvalued sectors. Personnel concentration risk is comparably higher at GQG. This amplifies any potential value destruction if GQG is unable to retain the services of key personnel. To date, Rajiv Jain remains the key investment decision-maker at GQG, wearing multiple hats as chief investment officer, chair, and lead portfolio manager of GQGs primary investment strategies. Moreover, Jain likely holds sway on all matters GQG given his 68.8% shareholding in the firm. CEO Tim Carver is also a substantial shareholder, owning 5.6% of the firm. We understand Jain is whom most analysts report to, and whom many investment ideas originate from. He is also likely GQGs trump card in business development initiatives. Accordingly, GQG investors are especially exposed to downside risks (such as potential mandate losses) if Jain is unable to perform his duties. Beyond Jain, we note GQG has a centralised, generalist research team covering an entire investment universe at which all portfolios are constructed from. Prospective rollouts of future strategies may stretch analyst capabilities, while prospective analyst turnovers can also be damaging. GQG appears to be spending most of its time gathering institutional or sub-advised money that are less sticky than retail funds. About 79% of FUM are institutional (43%) and sub-advised (36%) funds. These cohort of investors typically have the upper hand when negotiating fees, and are less forgiving of underperformance. They contribute substantial FUM, or are served by consultants that: (1) intermediate fund flows and (2) are measured against performance benchmarks themselves. In todays investment climate where theres no shortage of fund managers to hire, institutional and sub-advised clients can withdraw mandates after just one year of underperformance. There is little captive money, as GQGs investment management/subadvisory agreements have no fixed terms and can be terminated on short notice.Nonetheless, we acknowledge several of GQGs good traits that can amplify its inflows and perceived brand strength when performance is smooth-sailing. Management fees are below peer averagesoften sitting in the lowest two quartilesand there are limited performance fees. Each of GQGs primary strategies have outperformed benchmarks, on an annualised basis since inception through to June 30, 2023. On average, they rank close to the top quartile of Morningstars Category Average over a trailing-three-year period, as of June 2023. Its upside and downside capture ratios are also peer leading. GQGs strategies are generally positively rated by consultants and research houses. Analysts and staff are progressively given equity, helping to ensure alignment of interests.Having been established in 2016, GQG is younger than its ASX-listed peers Magellan (established 2006), Platinum (established 1994), Pendal (established 1969), Perpetual (established 1886), Janus Henderson (established in 1934), AFIC (established 1928) or Argo (established 1946). Accordingly, there may be room for GQG to evolve its strategy and build up an economic moat over time. For example, through external recruitment or acquisitions, GQG could transform into a larger-scale asset manager with more asset classes/strategies on offer. The firm could also diversify its clientele (to include more retail money) or product structure (such as creating managed accounts or active ETFs for retail clients). We believe any progress on these fronts are unlikely to be material enough to support an economic moat over our forecast period. Experience suggests that well-performing boutiques often prefer to maintain their investment strategy and preserve their offering (and fees), rather than cede control and influence through transformative mergers. This inertia could last indefinitely even with long-term underperformance, as managers would often assert that their investment rationale has not yet been realised. With GQGs current track record and Jains strong leadership and control, we think a more plausible base case is for GQG to pursue bolt on acquisitions or product enhancements that align with its current listed equity offerings. These include sector-based, income-focused, geographic-specific, or smaller-cap strategies. Jain could relinquish some of his portfolio manager responsibilities in the future. Even then, he will most likely remain as CIO and still call the shots on most, if not all, of GQGs investment strategies. ","We assign GQG a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. A key risk to shareholders is if GQGs cohort of funds underperform their benchmarks over a prolonged period. GQGs high conviction investing approach results in the firm managing portfolios that often significantly deviate from their benchmarks. This means investors may need to brace for periods of patchy relative returns. If GQGs strategies underperform their benchmarks persistently, this could make it harder to attract new funds, and lead to net fund outflows. The growth of low-cost passive investment options further exacerbates this risk.GQG is also exposed to earnings volatility from equity market gyrations. It sells exclusively listed equity products, meaning there could be significant earnings shortfall in the event of a major fall in equity markets. Revenue is primarily generated from management fees on FUM and, hence, its movement.GQGs key person risk is comparably higher than its ASX-listed peers. Specifically, investors are exposed to acute downside risks (such as potential mandate losses) if Rajiv Jain is unable to replicate his investment efforts in the future. Jain currently wears many hats as chair, chief investment officer, and lead portfolio manager for an expanding number of investment strategies. Apart from owning close to 70% of GQG, Jain is also the firms manager of analysts, primary idea generator, face of business development, and help set the firm's overall corporate strategy. A number of GQGs investment agreements specifically provide that investors may redeem their money if Jain ceases to be CIO.GQG is also exposed to environmental, social, and governance risks, such as data/security breaches, conflicts of interest, or misconduct that could result in loss of customer trust, regulatory actions, or litigations. We dont believe these present a material risk to GQG given it has appropriate risk management policies, both in operations and in investing.","We assign GQG a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This is based on our assessment of investment efficacy, balance sheet risk and shareholder distributions. Investment efficacy is standard. Like all dedicated boutique managers, GQG intends to create shareholder value mainly via picking the right stocks in its managed investments. We commend managements focus on investing, but this is insufficient to help GQG build out a durable competitive advantage relative to peers. The balance of power is shifting from asset managers to end clients, who today have no shortage of fund managers to hire, are more intolerant of underperformance and demand lower fees. Over the last few years, moatworthy fund managersmainly large scale managers or holding companieshave expanded their FUM and clients via new asset classes, extension strategies, new master feeder structures, or acquisitions. Scalewhich reduces feeskeeps the lid on criticism when there is underperformance, while product diversity helps attract and keep hold of client funds throughout market cycles.In contrast, GQG is channelling its energy on performance, and introducing product enhancements which are slight variations of its growth-oriented, valuation-conscious investing strategy. We understand the firm has largely rejected requests for customised strategies. Admirably, strong performance track record and relatively lower management fees have put GQG in the good books of investors and consultants, and the firm is right to capitalise on this momentum to diversify its investor base beyond the U.S. Furthermore, co-founders Rajiv Jain and Tim Carver have substantial skin in the game, as evidenced by their combined 74.4% ownership of GQG (post-IPO).But there is no magic formula for consistent outperformance. Markets get irrational, and strategies periodically fall out of favour. Our manager research team has observed that Jains high-conviction portfolios tended to outperform during downturns, and less so during periods of market strength. If GQG underperforms indefinitely or support for Jain wanes in the investment community, sentiment can swiftly turn negative and redemptions may ensue. The firms high reliance on less-forgiving institutional and subadvised clients and its lack of product variety exacerbate the risk of outflows.Selling only listed equities also exposes GQG to competition from passive investments. Index funds and ETFs are today capable of mimicking an active portfolio, or even outperforming a benchmark, by investing based on a set of rules or algorithmsall at a lower cost than active funds. GQG has a sound balance sheet, and we believe its financial health will remain strong. In general, asset managers (including GQG) are relatively capital light and do not require any collateral to guarantee investment returns. We expect the firm to remain debt-free in the absence of a material acquisition, which we think is unlikely. Given minimal capital requirements, we believe its appropriate that GQG pays out most of its profits as dividends.","Established in 2016, GQG Partners is a global boutique asset management firm focused on active equity portfolios. The company offers investment advisory and portfolio management services. GQG Partners manages money for investors around the world, including pension funds, sovereign funds, wealth management firms, and other financial institutions. Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, GQG also has operations in New York, Seattle, London, Sydney, and other locations. ","GQGs strong financial health is underpinned by its conservative balance sheet with no debt and a healthy cash balance. Operations are funded by operating cash flows. Its 2021 initial public offering was a sell-down, with the proceeds raised mainly used to pay Rajiv Jain, Tim Carver, Pacific Current Group and internal employees. The firm has no intention (nor do we foresee a need) to draw down debt to fund its operating activities. Consistent earnings, strong cash flow conversion, and a strong balance sheet support GQGs high dividend payout ratio target of 85%-95% of distributable earnings (net income after tax plus tax benefit resulting from amortisation of the deferred tax asset).High dividend payouts are a key feature of the capital-light asset-management sector, delivering attractive shareholder returns while maintaining comfortable balance sheet settings. Notwithstanding the high payout ratio, we are confident GQG's cash on balance sheet will continue to grow, enabling attractive dividends despite possible earnings volatility.",GQG.AX,Financial Services,4329352704.0,ASX,511558.0,AUD,1.4149999618530271,True,1,1.4043761135586206,1.8438129512268293,1
24/11/2023,Baidu Remains in Position To Capitalize on Search Advertising and AI Technology in the Long Term,Baidu Inc,09888,4,22/11/2023,Kai Wang,118.2,HKD,24/11/2023,180.0,High,Wide,Standard,,22/11/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimate of USD 183 (HKD 180) after Baidu posted mixed resultscore advertising revenue grew 5% year on year in line with our forecasts but with cloud revenue decline of 2%. This was offset by core operating margin of 25%, which increased by 70 basis points sequentially and alleviated concerns that Baidus artificial intelligence, or AI, projects would put major pressure on medium-term profitability. Baidu did not provide specific guidance but indicated that next quarter's ad revenue growth should be better than this quarter's and outpace Chinas GDP growthimplying a 5%-10% year-on-year increase.It also mentioned that the cloud revenue decline is only temporary. Operating margin increased due to a reduction in operating expenses. Baidu suggested that a 22%-25% operating margin (stock-based expenses excluded) should be maintainable, but that the fourth quarter's should be lower at 21%, due to further AI investments. Management believes that it still has ample room for efficiency improvement and will strive to maintain the current operating margin for 2024. We remain positive on Baidu, given that it maintains a wide moat and dominant market share in Chinas search advertising industry. Advertising headwinds were due to e-commerce weakness, which is consistent with government data showing only a 4% year-on-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter. Baidu also indicated that Double 11 activity this year was light. E-commerce is the second-largest sector by revenue, behind healthcare, for advertising on Baidu. Weakness for the cloud business was due to a slowdown from lower government spending. There was less emphasis on developing smart transportation projects from the government, which are billed as one-time contracts where some contracts had delays in renewal. The company remains upbeat that these contracts will eventually restart next year.","Baidu is strengthening its mobile ecosystem with search, livestreaming, and mini programs, helping to create a closed-loop experience for users to acquire information and make transaction. Baidu is a leader in AI with autonomous driving in terms of number of miles tested and the number of driving licenses in China could become another growth catalyst. Sitting on a cash pile of over CNY 100 billion, Baidu has ample dry powder to invest in technology, particularly in AI, as well as merger and acquisition opportunities.","Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Kuaishou and other social media platforms are competing in terms of advertising budgets, which will result in slow growth in revenue for Baidu search. Despite numerous growth initiatives, there is great uncertainty whether the new businesses can be monetized successfully on a mass scale. Failure to do so would result in heavy margin drag. Baidus leadership and brand in search have been weakened by more competitors entering the market such as Sogou and could be affected by future regulatory risks.",23/08/2023,"Baidus online advertising business accounted for 73% of Core revenue in 2022 and will be the main source of revenue in the medium term given its dominant market share for search engines, but we believe unless it can develop another industry-leading business, it could face long-term challenges for advertising dollars from growing competitors such as Tencent and ByteDance. Baidu is increasingly shifting its focus toward its cloud business and now also artificial intelligence, with its Ernie generative AI model becoming its flagship product. We believe that Baidu is an early mover and should benefit from China's AI development, but whether Ernie will be the long-term leader will depend on execution as we believe other resource-heavy companies have the potential to catch up to Baidu if there are missteps in its generative AI development.  While Baidu is transforming its identity by investing in generative AI, cloud, and autonomous driving, commercialized success remains to be seen. There are encouraging signs of its AI cloud monetization growing to 19% of core revenue in 2022 from 12% in 2020. However, despite sharp growth, we expect Baidu to face competition in the cloud from industry leaders Alibaba, Huawei and Tencent, which all have greater market share than Baidu. Despite a potential total addressable market for autonomous driving that is 9 times its online advertising per management, commercial success is highly uncertain as revenue remains immaterial, and mass scale adoption or time-to-market are unclear. Its streaming video service, iQiyi, continues to be a margin drag on Baidus business due to a high content cost. The business constantly needs to develop or acquire new content to prevent customer churn. We're less confident of its outlook than the Core product due to a low barrier to entry and numerous competitors. Membership has remained stagnant at 105 million to 106 million subscribers for the last five quarters and therefore, we believe long-term growth is limited.","Baidus wide economic moat is created by its network effect from a dominant share of the user base and intangible assets from years of AI development and research and development. As one of the earliest internet companies in China, Baidu has built an ecosystem around search and successfully shifted to mobile internet by releasing various well-received mobile apps, such as its flagship Baidu app, which had 580 million monthly active users as of second-quarter 2021, and Baidu Maps. According to web analytics firm, Statcounter, Baidu's market share as of September 2021 was 82.5%, compared with its closest Chinese competitor Sogou at 7.6%.Its incumbent market share and network effect from its years of dominance are Baidus moat sources for the search business. It has a large database of user behavior data in China, which Baidus AI search engine has accumulated over the course of almost two decades. This is critical in generating the most relevant results for users, which leads to increased usage and more data and higher advertising efficiency. Meanwhile, Baidu has built up a network effect and a positive feedback loop in its search business by leveraging its significant search traffic on both PC and mobile devices; this is difficult for its competitors to replicate, as it would take a long time to achieve a user database and marketing customer base of similar size. The larger the user base, the more user data Baidu can collect and analyze, improving the search engine algorithm and relevancy of search results. Users receive better, more tailored recommendations, making it less likely for users to use another search engine. With the large amount of user data, Baidu can provide personalized advertising strategies so advertisers can better target customers. This results in advertisers becoming more willing to pay higher cost-per-click, or CPC, for promoted ads and priority positioning given a higher click-through rate, or CTR.In addition, Baidus commands a higher cost-per-mille impressions, or CPM, and CPC rate relative to its competitors, which illustrates its wide moat. Despite higher fees, advertisers still prefer to use Baidu as an advertising platform, which is good indicator of the strength of its network effect. According to marketing firm AdChina.io, Baidu Search ads have an average CPM and CPC of CNY 7-CNY 70 and CNY 2-CNY 9, which is higher than that of Douyin, Weibo, and Toutiao based on the midpoint. This is likely due to Baidu being a pull-based internet platform, meaning ad placements are largely dictated by the users search queries where they actively seek out content, compared with other platforms such as Douyin, Toutiao, and Weibo where platforms are push-based, where ads are pushed"" or delivered to the consumer without much interaction on their part. Nevertheless, it still illustrates how Baidu is viewed as more valuable platform for advertisers.One factor that could impact Baidus moat is whether it violates online advertising laws for the healthcare industry again. Following the Wei Zexi incident in early 2016, where a cancer patient mistook a promoted ad for cancer treatment, Chinese authorities launched new regulations for online search and advertising, which required defined paid search results as advertising and enforced stricter standards for online platforms. These regulations took effect Sept. 1, 2016. There is also a set of stricter regulations for the financial technology sector, which will be regulated like traditional financial institutions. Healthcare accounts for about 15% of Baidu Cores online marketing revenue, and Baidu is an industry leader for healthcare advertising. Should Baidu violate laws again or if the local authorities release more policies regarding its advertising practices, Baidus dominant position for healthcare advertising could be weakened.Besides web search, Baidu provides other related content, such as Baidu Post Bar (a social media service), Baidu Knows (a query-based searchable community to share knowledge and experiences), Baidu Encyclopedia, and Baijiahao (a platform for content owners to publish content and manage their fans), which can improve the user experience as well as allocate more ad inventory. It also acquired YY Live in late 2020 (subject to close) to provide livestreaming as well. Along with its smart mini programs, the wide range of content and different services are combined to form an open platform ecosystem operating under its flagship Baidu app and has also contributed to its moat.We think iQiyi has no moat, given intense competition. IQiyi is Baidus online video platform, having merged with PPS in 2013. According to Questmobile, iQiyi is one of the two leaders in the video streaming industry in China with 570 million monthly active users (versus 540 million at Tencent Video) in March 2020. As with major online video platforms in other regions, iQiyis monetization model has been shifting from advertising to a mix of advertising and subscription. As of second-quarter 2021, there were 106.2 million subscribers but membership appears to have stalled since end-2019. Although iQiyi is one of the current top two leaders in online video, we believe it faces intense competition, a low barrier to entry, and uncertain long-term cash flow generation capability. We see Baidus AI development and emerging technologies as valuable intangible assets but assess these businesses to have narrow moats. Again, there is high uncertainty over successful long-term monetization despite heavy investment and a head start in these early lifecycle businesses. Baidu faces an unfamiliar road map for its new businesses and its history of operations outside its core search competency has not been great. Of its new businesses, Baidu Cloud currently generates the greatest revenue, but we estimate it is still loss-making. In addition, it faces competition from Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent which all have greater market share than Baidu, adding to the uncertainty of successful monetization.Baidus other major AI areas--autonomous vehicles and voice recognition (DuerOS)--are still loss-making but given the amount of time and resources spent on R&D, we see a positive trend given recent launches of AI-enabled products and large monetization potential. Part of its intangible asset moat is the large data set it has collected, which requires a massive amount of time and resources. According to Andrew Ng, the founder of Google Brain, former chief scientist of Baidu, and adjunct professor at Stanford University, 50,000 hours or five years of audio data and text transcripts are required for speech recognition training. In 2017, Baidu had 100,000 hours of such data.Baidu is also a first-mover for autonomous driving and has the most autonomous driving licenses in China. Currently, Apollo robotaxis are open to the public in Beijing, Changsha, and Cangzhou and are being tested in 27 additional cities in China. Baidu launched a mobility-as-a-service pilot program in Guangzhou in February 2021. Guangzhou residents can use integrated apps to access robotaxis, automated shuttles, self-driving buses, autonomous police robots, and driverless vending carts, all supported by Baidus Apollo autonomous driving platform. Baidu was also given the green light to operate Chinas first self-driving bus in a specific area in Chongqing. In 2018, Baidu began mass production and operation of autonomous minibuses. Currently DuerOS, a natural language-based platform, is building its presence in automotive software for vehicles in China. One million vehicles run DuerOS on 600 vehicle models across 70 manufacturers, per Forbes.","We think Baidu faces intense competition and uncertainty whether its AI business will generate satisfactory returns.Though Baidu is the largest search engine in China, it is competing with the other internet giants, Tencent and ByteDance. It also competes with other internet companies for advertising dollars. Baidus margins have declined by aggressive spending in video content and the mobile business.Baidu also competes in AI, such as cloud computing, voice and image recognition, and autonomously driven cars. At the current stage, it is difficult to predict whether Baidu will be the final winner in AI and whether the ROI will be adequate.ESG Risks1) There are business ethics risks for Baidu given its history of medical advertising on its platform. In 2016, a patient died after he mistook a promoted ad on Baidu's search for a cancer treatment, and there has been increased scrutiny over the advertising content on Baidus platform that has led to increased oversight. Chinese authorities launched new regulations--and enforced stricter standards for online advertisers. Medical advertising accounts for approximately 15% of advertising revenue and could be at risk should another mishap occur.2) There is increasing global concern on the purpose of AI usage involving unethical behavior. However, we believe there is low probability for this risk occurrence given Robin Li has proposed ethical guidelines for new tech, but it remains an ongoing ESG concern should Baidus technology be found to be used for unethical purposes. 3) Human capital risk is also a concern for Baidu given recent leadership turnover. In May 2018, its COO Qi Lu, who was supposed to further develop the AI business, left only after 1.5 years. The resignation follows another shakeup in March 2017, where both the head of AI and Apollo left within the same week. Given that these products require long development cycles, frequent turnovers in leadership could delay plans for commercialization.","We assess the capital allocation of Baidu as Standard.Baidus balance sheet risk is low as it is in a net cash position. It had CNY 144.4 billion net cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023. Baidu has lost its status as one of the top three internet firms as information can be acquired by users through a lot more forms, such as feeds and apps, compared with previously, where using searches was more dominant. Baidu wasnt able to capture the mobile internet opportunities, compared with Tencent and Alibaba. Some of Baidus acquisitions and business developments have proved unsuccessful. These include the acquisition of 59% of Nuomi, a group-buying service provider, for USD 160 million in 2013 and the remaining stake in 2014 for an undisclosed sum, and Raven Tech for USD 90 million in 2017. Baidu scaled back on Nuomi after it announced reducing subsidies for the business in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2016, and it eventually sold Nuomi to iQiyi in 2018. 36kr reported that the lifetime sales volume of Raven Techs smart speaker was 10,000 versus the target of 200,000. The founder of Raven Tech left Baidu and the Raven Tech team was reported to be marginalized. It was reported that Lu once commented that the acquisition of Raven Tech was hasty. Baidus investments in online-to-offline businesses such as deliveries and Nuomi led to its operating margin declining from 26.1% in 2014 to 14.2% in 2016 but they did not gain as much scale as Meituan. However, we refrain from giving a Poor capital allocation rating to Baidu for several reasons. Baidu made the right decision in moving away from the O2O businesses, which led to margin improvement to 18.5% in 2017, and investing in mobile and AI, which we believe is sensible given that they complement its strong core search business. Baidu is now focusing on its AI businesses, such as AI cloud and Internet of Things, such as smart speakers, and its autonomous driving businesses. Baidus search business was built on AI, therefore it has competitive advantage in certain areas of AI, especially natural language processing. Its AI cloud, the current driver of growth, grew at the rate of 71% in the second quarter of 2021. We expect margins will increase as standardization gradually increases over time as more customers in the same vertical adopt similar solutions and as renewals increase. While it is still early, we see Baidu is leading in many areas in L4 autonomous driving, such as test miles, number of cities with testing and operations, cost, size of car fleet, coverage of high definition map, and so on. Also, Baidus return on invested capital has been way higher than its weighted average cost of capital of 9.8% over the past 10 years. We expect to see return on invested capital to remain very high versus WACC despite reducing gradually in the next five years due to investment into the AI business.","Baidu is the largest internet search engine in China with 84% share of the search engine market in September 2021 per web analytics firm, Statcounter. The firm generated 72% of core revenue from online marketing services from its search engine in 2022. Outside its search engine, Baidu is a technology-driven company and its other major growth initiatives are artificial intelligence cloud, video streaming services, voice recognition technology, and autonomous driving.","Baidu's balance sheet remains very well capitalized, with around CNY 236 billion in cash and short-term investments to support CNY 91 billion in total debt as of June 30, 2023. Its free cash flow was CNY 7.7 billion in 2022, which is sufficient to fund operations and maintain its moat through investments in new products.

24/11/2023,Nomura is Japan's Largest Independent Securities Firm,Nomura Holdings Inc,8604,3,02/11/2023,Michael Makdad,605.0,JPY,24/11/2023,590.0,Medium,,Standard,D,02/11/2023,"We are raising our fair value estimate for Daiwa Securities to JPY 800, or 0.76 times book value, from JPY 650, or 0.62 times book value, while maintaining our estimate for Nomura Holdings at JPY 590, or 0.54 times book value. Daiwas September-quarter ROE of 8.0% outperformed Nomuras 4.3% and our estimate of around 6% for the sector average. Daiwas earnings were well-balanced among its retail, wholesale, and asset-management segments, in contrast to Nomura, which lagged in its global wholesale business even as it enjoyed strong retail-segment profits in Japan. Rather than the earnings performance, though, the main driver for our increase in our fair value estimate for Daiwa is larger shareholder distributions than we previously expected. Daiwa announced a JPY 35 billion share buyback on top of the JPY 25 billion it already completed this fiscal year. That means that the total payout ratio this year, which already reached 81% of earnings in the fiscal first half, is likely to top 100% for the full year, per our estimates. We had previously forecast that Daiwa would pay out 50% of its earnings as dividends and use an additional 20% of its earnings to repurchase shares, for a total shareholder return payout ratio of 70%. We now forecast that Daiwa will have a total shareholder return payout ratio of 75% in future years, after distributing all its earnings and then some this fiscal year. We remain somewhat cautious on our forecasts of Daiwas future earnings, however. We see midcycle ROE for it of around 7.5%, above our forecast for Nomuras midcycle ROE of around 6.0%, but still slightly below the cost of equity given its lack of an economic moat.","Given its business of selling and managing financial assets, Nomura is one of the Japanese companies best positioned to increase earnings quickly in a strongly reflationary macroeconomic scenario. Low investor expectations, due to Nomuras history of expanding and retrenching overseas and occasionally posting big losses, belie the firms inherent strength in its core businesses. Although Nomura has adopted more pay for performance than in past decades, the compensation structure is still more weighted toward fixed costs that create operating leverage in an upswing.","Nomura has posted large unexpected losses several times in its history, such as the JPY 700 billion loss in fiscal 2008, which included exposure to Iceland and the Madoff scheme as well as write-downs of real estate assets.  Nomura relies on bank borrowings and confidence-sensitive market funding, which is a disadvantage vis-a-vis competitors that are part of banking groups with large stable deposits. Nomura has been unable to generate consistently positive returns from its overseas operations.",02/11/2023,"Nomura is Japans largest independent broker, with a market share of around 30% of client assets (stocks, bonds, funds, and so on) held in brokerage accounts in Japan, larger than the 18% held at rival Daiwa Securities and the 10%-17% shares at the securities units of the three megabanks. In investment trusts, Nomuras market share of assets under management in publicly and privately placed funds was 18% as of mid-2023, roughly double the share of its largest rivals.  Japanese people associate the Nomura name with competency in handling such investment products, and it has accumulated decades of know-how in training its branch staff to gather assets and develop long-term relationships of trust with high net-worth individuals. We estimate that the return on equity of Nomuras domestic retail and asset-management businesses has historically been well above 10%.  Meanwhile, Nomuras global wholesale business has no clear advantage competing with foreign securities companies with better connections overseas. Even the European investment banks, which are larger than Nomura and more culturally similar to the U.S., consistently lost share to the U.S.-based banks after the global financial crisis owing to their inability to fully penetrate the U.S. market, which accounts for close to half of the total global fee pool. On its own, Nomura lacks the resources to be more than a niche player, in our view. Despite this fact, Nomura continues to hold more balance sheet risk than it needs to pursue its core business, although it has made some progress in the past few years reducing its high overseas cost structure. Another issue is that Nomura's relatively moaty core business of domestic retail and asset management is facing some erosion of its long-term advantages as its core customer base ages. We think Nomura's traditional approach has less currency with younger generations and the firm needs to enhance its digital offerings to fend off potential competition from internet firms.","We do not believe Nomura has an economic moat. Its lack of scale in its global wholesale business compared with European and especially U.S.-based competitors is too much of a drag on its overall returns, despite the likely presence of narrow moats surrounding its domestic retail and asset-management businesses, where Nomura benefits from the intangible asset of its strong brand name and customer relationships. In Japan, we estimate that Nomura has a market share of around 29% of client assets (stocks, bonds, funds, and so on) held in brokerage accounts, larger than the approximately 18% held at rival Daiwa Securities and the 10%-16% shares at the securities units of the three megabanks, underpinning Nomuras advantage in the retail business. In investment trusts, Nomuras market share of assets under management, or AUM, in publicly and privately placed funds is around 18%, roughly double the share of its largest rivals. Japanese people associate the Nomura name with competency in handling such investment products, and it has accumulated decades of know-how in training its branch staff to gather assets and develop long-term relationships of trust with high-net-worth individuals. We estimate that the ROE of Nomuras domestic retail and asset-management businesses has historically been well above 10%. However, the strengths of the domestic retail and asset-management businesses are diluted by Nomuras subscale global wholesale business, where the firm has no clear long-term advantage competing with foreign securities companies with better connections overseas. Even the European investment banks, which are larger than Nomura and more culturally similar to the U.S., consistently lost share to the U.S.-based banks after the global financial crisis owing to their inability to fully penetrate the U.S. market, which accounts for close to half of the total global fee pool. ","The Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Nomura is Medium. As a securities firm, its earnings are tied to inherently volatile capital markets. Although its domestic retail and asset-management segments have historically been relatively stable, its global wholesale operations have not only failed to earn a decent return on capital over the past two decades, but its returns have been quite volatile, such as in the fiscal year ended March 2009, when the wholesale segment posted a huge pretax loss of JPY 717 billion, or in the fiscal year ended March 2019, when it had a JPY 111 billion pretax loss.Nomura has a history of encountering regulatory sanctions and civil lawsuits from counterparties. Several times in the past, regulatory issues have prompted senior management to resign, but the earnings impact has usually been limited to only a few quarters. That said, we believe that if Nomura were to fall afoul of Japanese regulators in a major way, its future as an independent firm could be in question. We believe Nomura' environmental social and governance, or ESG, risks are moderate and do not pose significant additional aggregate risk beyond the risks we already incorporate in our bear-case scenario. ","We assign a capital allocation rating of Standard to Nomura. Its policy is to pay at least 40% of earnings in each semiannual period in the form of dividends and to aim for a total shareholder return ratio, including both dividends and buybacks, of at least 50%. In fact, the firm has returned almost all its earnings over the past seven years to shareholders (47% in the form of dividends plus another 45% in the form of share buybacks). However, Nomura management has in the past sometimes elected to pursue large acquisitions that ultimately ended up destroying shareholder value.The firm's history is studded with a variety of scandals, most recently an information leak in 2019 and previously an insider-trading scandal in 2012 that forced out the CEO at the time. Although unrelated to the insider-trading scandal that led to his ouster in 2012, former CEO Kenichi Watanabes decision in 2008 to acquire former Lehman Brothers assets in Asia and Europe proved to be a poor one in hindsight, whether because of misguided strategy, inadequate execution, or just bad luck related to unforeseen developments such as the euro crisis. By more than doubling its number of overseas employees from 4,000 to around 11,000 currently, Nomura increased its total costs by more than a quarter, yet revenue did not rise to the same extent, and Nomuras ROE has averaged only 5.5% since 2010. Dilutive equity offerings in 2009 to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and the increased costs have resulted in Nomuras share price staying below JPY 1,000, after having traded consistently above this level (sometimes greatly so) in the quarter century before 2008. ","Nomura is Japans largest broker, about twice the size of rival Daiwa Securities and roughly three times the size of the securities units of the three megabanks. It is also the largest asset-management company in Japan, with a similar size differential compared with its rivals. Despite its topnotch brand name in retail broking and asset management in Japan, Nomura has struggled to compete effectively in the institutional securities business against larger global rivals. In 2008, Nomura bought European and Asian assets of the failed Lehman Brothers, which led to a sharply higher cost base but did not provide commensurate revenue. Nomura has reduced the scale of these businesses but maintains its ambition to compete globally with the top players.","Nomura's consolidated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.7% as of JUne 2023, above the average for global systemically important banks of 12.7% (though Nomura, as a broker, can see more short-term volatility in its risk-weighted assets than commercial banks do, suggesting the need for a buffer if it wanted to maintain similar ratios even during periods of market stress). Its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure had been below the GSIB average but was 5.41% as of June 2023.Nomura has not been included in the list of GSIBs since the Basel-based Financial Stability Board started to designate such banks in 2011, but Japans Financial Services Agency has designed it as a domestic systemically important bank and requires the firm to meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements. Nomura depends on having access to bank and market funding. Of its approximately JPY 12 trillion in unsecured funding, 70% is long-term, with an average maturity of 6.2 years as of March 2023. The company calculates its liquid assets at JPY 7.65 trillion, or 16% of total assets. High Quality Liquid Assets as defined by Basel rules were JPY 6.5 trillion as of June 2023, slightly more than twice the amount of theoretical net cash outflows.",8604.T,Financial Services,1823796756480.0,JPX,7011700.0,JPY,605.0,True,0,583.7889419183512,749.5063291139201,1
24/11/2023,Wisconsin Remains a Very Constructive Environment for Utilities,WEC Energy Group Inc,WEC,4,31/10/2023,Andrew Bischof,81.48,USD,23/11/2023,96.0,Low,Narrow,Exemplary,B,31/10/2023,"We are reaffirming our $96 per share fair value estimate for WEC Energy after the company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.00 per share, up from the $0.96 per share reported in the same year-ago period. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. The company reaffirmed its 2023 earnings guidance range of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, with an expectation to be at the upper half of the range. Management reaffirmed their long-term annual earnings growth target of 6.5% to 7% and extended it to 2028. Our 7% growth forecast through 2027 remains unchanged. We expect dividend growth in line with earnings growth, including a 7.2% increase this year representing the company's 20th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. WEC Energy's stock has fallen 17% since April and now trades at a near-15% discount to our fair value estimate as of Oct. 31, making it one of the more attractive utilities in our coverage. Positive attributes include a best-in-class management team and above-average growth opportunities supported by constructive regulation. We think its 3.8% dividend yield and growth potential make it an attractive buying opportunity. The company increased and updated its capital investment program, with plans to spend $23.4 billion, a $3.3 billion increase from its prior program. The company will increase investments in renewable energy, natural gas generation, and transmission. The company lowered its energy infrastructure investment and reallocated the capital to rate-regulated investment opportunities, which we view positively. To fund the plan, the company plans to issue up to $2.2 billion in equity. We think management might look to monetize one of its natural gas distribution utilities to offset the potential equity need. Earnings in the quarter benefited from continued investment and continued operating expense improvement. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher interest expense among other smaller items.","Wisconsin, representing nearly two thirds of WEC Energy's business, is a favorable regulatory environment with a forward-looking test year and earned returns above the national average. The company's capital investment plans support our forecast for earnings in line with management's 6.5%-7% guidance range. WEC has numerous growth opportunities across its operating subsidiaries.","WEC Energy's large investment plan increases regulatory risk. Regional economic opportunities might not pan out, lowering long-term growth opportunities. As with all regulated utilities, rising interest rates will raise financing costs and could make the dividend less attractive for income investors.",07/08/2023,"WEC Energy Group is the largest Midwest utility, with approximately $26.5 billion of rate base and derives most of its earnings derived from regulated operations. Nearly 75% of earnings come from constructive Wisconsin and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulation. Its regulated-like commercial renewable energy business accounts for the remainder of earnings. We expect the company to invest more than $20 billion of capital through 2027, which includes its investment in American Transmission. This investment plan supports our forecast that the company will achieve management's narrow 6.5%-7% annual earnings growth target. In Wisconsin, the company enjoys rates based on two-year forward test years and an earnings-sharing mechanism over its allowed return on equity. Its average allowed ROE tops 9.8% at the company's subsidiaries in the state and is consistently above peers'. In late 2022, the company's Wisconsin subsidiaries received a final rate case order that is consistent with our view that Wisconsin remains a very constructive regulatory environment for utilities. We think the limited reopener of the utilities' rate case will once again highlight Wisconsin's constructiveness. The company is moving aggressively on its renewable energy investment plan. It targets investing $5.4 billion for 3.3 gigawatts of new solar, battery storage, and wind generation development through 2027. The company plans to retire 1,400 MW of coal generation and to retire older, less-efficient natural gas generation. The company plans to use coal generation as a backup fuel only by 2030 and exit coal generation by 2035. WEC has also allocated nearly $2.0 billion for unregulated renewable energy infrastructure investments. We think these are good investments for shareholders with higher returns than WEC's rate-regulated business with regulated utility-type risks. This is a contrast with many of its peers that are divesting commercial renewable energy portfolios to offset equity needs. WEC does not need any equity to support its current investment plan. WEC Energy holds a 60% majority stake in ATC, through which it earns above-average equity returns despite recent FERC decisions.","Service territory monopolies and efficient scale advantages are the primary sources of economic moat for regulated utilities such as WEC Energy Group. State and federal regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks. In exchange for regulated utilities service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow regulated utilities to outearn their costs of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing. Intuitively, utilities should have an economic moat based on efficient scale, but in some cases regulation offsets this advantage, preventing excess returns on capital. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions precludes regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moat ratings to many regulated utilities.","We rate WEC Energy Group with a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.WEC Energy Group's ability to obtain rate adjustments depends on maintaining constructive relations with regulators. If regulatory relations weaken, regulators could cut the utility's allowed return, resulting in earnings and cash flow pressure. However, the state's long track record of constructive ratemaking eases this risk. Another potential risk for WEC shareholders is that electricity or natural gas demand could fall, requiring larger rate increases to continue earning its allowed returns. The company has a significant ongoing development program that is subject to potential cost overruns and political and regulatory risk. Tightening environmental compliance regulations could require significant capital investment or added operating costs, which could have uncertain cost recovery through traditional regulated rates. WEC Energy Group operates natural gas distribution utilities. While we think natural gas will remain the primary source for heating in the Midwest for the foreseeable future, there is risk that policymakers expedite the shift away from natural gas.WEC Energy faces environmental, social, and governance risk, particularly given its coal fleet. Across its service territories, regulators and politicians are embracing tighter policies on carbon emissions and greater restrictions on coal generation. WEC Energy is addressing this risk through its base capital investment program, planned coal plant retirements, and renewable energy additions. The company plans to use coal generation only as a backup fuel by 2030 and to exit coal generation by 2035. WEC Energy's goal of being a net carbon neutral by 2050, with interim targets of 60% reduction by 2025 and 80% by 2030, is in line with its utility peers. Regulators across its jurisdictions are supporting this transition.","We assign WEC Energy Group an Exemplary capital allocation rating. The rating reflects our assessment of the company's strong balance sheet, management's investment decisions, and plans to return capital to shareholders.We consider WEC Energy Group's 65%-70% dividend payout ratio policy as appropriate, given the high-quality and relatively stable nature of the company's regulated assets. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound, in line with regulatory requirements and supported by the company's low revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. We expect the company's investment strategy to focus on growing assets through regulated investments, which we think is a reasonable approach.Management wisely invested in Power the Future, positioning the company well for environmental regulations and locking in some of the highest allowed returns in the industry. The company has earned at or near its allowed returns and managed regulatory relationships well. Management has done an excellent job integrating past acquisitions, often exceeding initial expectations for cost synergies. Management continues to impressively reduce costs to both customer and shareholder benefit.CEO Scott Lauber has been a very strong replacement. As COO and CFO, Lauber was instrumental in executing and identifying growth opportunities while continuing to drive industry-leading operating efficiencies across its subsidiaries.Gale Klappa will continue in his role as executive chairman until at least early 2024, keeping the roles of chairman and CEO separate, which we view positively and uncommon among its utility peers. Klappa's deep knowledge of the company will serve investors and the current management team well.","WEC Energy Group's electric and gas utility businesses serve electric and gas customers in its Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin service territories. The company also owns a 60% stake in American Transmission Co. WEC's asset mix is approximately 49% electric generation and distribution, 36% gas distribution, 10% electric transmission, and 5% unregulated renewable generation.","With a 60% debt/capital ratio and over 5.0 times interest coverage, WEC Energy Group's financial health is sound for a regulated utility, particularly in light of its stable, low-risk business model. With $20.1 billion of capital spending planned through 2027, WEC Energy will be a frequent debt issuer. The company has manageable long-term debt maturities. We anticipate it will be able to refinance its debt as it comes due, maintaining its debt/capital ratio near 60% during the next five years. We expect total debt/EBITDA to average 5.5 times. We do not expect WEC Energy to need to issue equity for its capital investment plan, consistent with management's expectations.WEC will target a 65%-70% dividend payout ratio. The board raised the dividend 7.2% for 2023, representing a 65% payout ratio based on our earnings estimate. We expect dividend growth for the company in line with our annual earnings growth forecast.",WEC,Utilities,26802513920.0,NYQ,1931037.0,USD,81.4800033569336,True,1,82.09209119011528,80.82513785656543,0
25/11/2023,Abacus Group's Storage Separation Is Complete,Abacus Group,ABG,5,05/09/2023,Alexander Prineas,1.03,AUD,24/11/2023,1.75,Medium,,Standard,,05/09/2023,"We reduce our fair value estimate for no-moat Abacus Group by 8% to AUD 1.75. Weve taken a fresh look, with the separation of its storage assets and operating platform into a separate entity, Abacus Storage King. Abacus Group retains a 20% stake in the storage entity and is remunerated as its manager, but the former's primary interest is now commercial property. Two thirds of the commercial portfolio are from 15 offices, the other third is retail and other properties. The retail portfolio is trading well, but the office portfolio faces new supply and tepid demand from hybrid working. Three fourths of the office portfolio is A-grade, mostly in inner city locations in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane, with a skew to central business district, or CBD, fringe locations, older buildings, and buildings with heritage elements. Abacus relatively short average lease length of 3.7 years implies higher-than-average leasing risk. Even so, Abacus Group securities still screen as significantly undervalued, trading at a 33% discount to our valuation and a 45% discount to pro forma AUD 2.11 net tangible assets per security at June 30, 2023. Guidance includes a fiscal 2024 distribution of 8.5 cents per share, which puts the REIT on a forward yield of 7.2%. Thats not bad, considering our outlook. We expect rising interest costs to roughly offset revenue growth for the next three years, leading to approximately flat funds from operations and distributions with moderate near-term downside risk, with decent mid-single-digit percentage growth thereafter. A pending exit from the S&P/ASX 200 index on Sept. 18, 2023 may be weighing on the security price as index funds and benchmark-hugging fund managers exit. And while Abacus looks cheap, some better-positioned office heavyweights are too. It will likely take time for the market to warm to Abacus new structure.","Storage demand has grown as economic activity improved, driving up occupancy and revenue per available square meter.  Many of Abacus assets are in secondary locations, which means rents are relatively low. There is upside potential if urban infill pushes sites to a higher and better use. Abacus has substantial expiries looming in its office portfolio. However, it may be able to redevelop the assets, adding value, or re-lease the buildings amid amid better economic conditions.","If asset values decline further, this could limit Abacus' growth options from acquisitions and developments. Abacus office portfolio is mostly in secondary locations, and could bear the brunt of  structural changes in the office market. Australia's lack of new dwelling construction is a major impediment for Abacus' stake in the storage business, as it could cause household formation to slow.",05/09/2023,"Abacus primary assets were historically an office portfolio of mostly secondary assets, and one of Australias top three portfolios of self-storage assets. The REIT split into two listed entities in mid-2023, with Abacus Storage King focused on storage, and this vehicle, Abacus Group, focused on commercial property. Abacus Group retains a 20% stake in Abacus Storage King, and is remunerated as its external manager. The storage portfolio remains a source of growth for Abacus Group and we expect further acquisitions and development for that vehicle. The group cites revenue growth as the major driver of acquisitions, with the approach being to acquire underutilised sites with occupancies potentially below 70%, then improve capacity via development, and increase occupancy up to circa 85%-90%, via the national Storage King marketing platform. We envisage moderate development and repositioning opportunities in the commercial property portfolio, though not to the same extent as in storage. The portfolio is roughly two-thirds offices and the remainder retail and other properties.","We do not attribute a moat to Abacus Group, due to its focus on office property, where we believe supply can be readily added, limiting negotiating power with tenants.Most of Abacus' office assets are fringe assets outside of core CBD locations. Our base case is that CBDs remain the major office markets, with most workers spending time either at home, or in a CBD office location. However, bifurcation in the office market is a risk, with employers seemingly favoring premium buildings in the very best CBD locations. That could limit rental growth for Abacus properties in fringe locations.Abacus has a handful of office properties that are, or have potential to be, higher quality CBD properties. However we consider the potential for new supply in these areas to be high.Abacus Group also retains a 20% stake in Abacus Storage King, which we expect will undertake further acquisition and development of storage assets. The industry is fragmented with more than one third of the market being single site operators, and the three largest operators accounting for only about one third of the industry. Being one of the three large players, Abacus Storage King gets some economy-of-scale advantages, for example marketing and advertising spend can be leveraged across its large network of storage sites, while relatively fixed overhead costs such as a call center can be spread across the wide network. However, overheads are not a huge proportion of overall costs in the sector, so we view economies of scale benefits as modest. Customer segmentation is limited by the fact that most storage users do not require a particular location. Convenience needs means customers are unlikely to cross the city, but they will readily cross to the next suburb for a lower price. There is some inertia, as once a customer enters a storage facility, they are unlikely to move to a rival facility for a cost saving. However, average stays in storage facilities are less than two years, suggesting limited ability to increase prices for existing customers. In fact, excessive price increases can often be the catalyst for customers to remove goods from storage.","We assign Abacus Group a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.A source of uncertainty is the short average lease length in its office portfolio. Office leasing conditions are weak at present due to elevated supply, and weak demand from hybrid working. Abacus has some office assets with redevelopment potential, but weak office market conditions, elevated construction costs, and higher interest rates pushing up the cost of capital means that the development environment is challenging. Abacus' balance sheet is in reasonable shape, but we expect asset values to keep declining, pushing down Abacus' net tangible assets, and putting upward pressure on gearing levels.Dwelling construction approvals remain at low levels, which might constrain new household formation, and thereby demand for storage, though we see tailwinds from strong population growth. We note that the recent mix of dwelling construction approvals has heavily favored detached housing over apartments, with the latter we believe being a more important for storage.","We assign Abacus a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. We view the balance sheet on a forward-looking basis as weak. Look-through gearing was 33% in December 2022. This improved to 32% on a pro forma basis, as at June 30, 2023. Abacus has lower revenue certainty than most other REITs. The groups income comes from storage assets where customer are not locked in, or office assets with a relatively short lease expiry. Developments, acquisitions, and declining asset valuations could push gearing up again in fiscal 2024.We view the investment strategy as fair, as we agree with management's strategy of becoming an asset-backed, annuity style business with a key focus on office, retail, and self-storage properties.We view the level of distributions as appropriate. Payments were reduced in fiscal 2020, however, we believe this was prudent given income impacts from coronavirus, and an uncertain outlook. The group targets a distribution payment of 85%-95% of funds from operations, which is a measure of a REIT's operating earnings. We view that as appropriate, reserving a modest amount for acquisitions and developments.","Abacus Property Group is primarily focused on storage and office property, with minor interests in other subsectors such as retail property. Its storage business remains an active acquirer and developer of property. Management separated the storage business in mid-2023. We don't view the separation as creating value in itself, however, we view it as a potential catalyst that could prompt the market to recognize latent value in Abacus' assets. However, it will likely take time for the market to get familiar with the two Abacus vehicles and its new structure.","The Abacus balance sheet is in reasonable shape but could be stronger. Pro forma gearing as defined by its banking covenants, as at June 30, 2023, was 32%. That's well below the covenant limit of 50%. However, we anticipate upward pressure on gearing since we think asset values have further to fall as commercial property markets adapt to higher interest rates.It's worth noting the REIT still has an exposure to storage, a sector that has minimal leases and weaker tenants than typical in a commercial property portfolio. Abacus' office leases are relatively short too. Therefore, we think its appropriate to maintain gearing below the sector average.The maturity profile of Abacus' debt means it has no imminent repayment obligations. However, refinancing could be more challenging if interest rates continue to rise, economic conditions severely deteriorate or either of the Abacus entities undertakes large capital expenditure or acquisitions.",ABG.AX,,,,,,1.0199999809265137,True,1,1.0447212384939024,1.10411161705875,1
24/11/2023,Japan Post Bank Has More Customer Deposits Than Any Other Financial Institution in Japan,Japan Post Bank Co Ltd,7182,2,17/11/2023,Michael Makdad,1468.0,JPY,24/11/2023,1210.0,Medium,,Poor,D,17/11/2023,"We raise our fair value estimate for Japan Post Bank to JPY 1,210 from JPY 1,090. Our new fair value is equivalent to 0.48 times book value as of September and implies a 15% downside from the current share price, meaning that we still think Japan Post Bank is somewhat overvalued relative to its intrinsic worth, despite some positive developments. The largest positive development, in our view, is CEO Ikeda Noritos announcement at the banks results meeting of an upcoming revision to the banks midterm plan next May that will offer specific return on equity performance targets and an achievement timeline for the targets, with an initial aim to achieve ROE above 5%. Japan Post Bank has not generated annual ROE of more than 3.3% since its IPO in 2015 and its profit guidance for this fiscal year implies ROE of only 3.5%. The second positive development is a change in the operating environment for Japan Post Bank that should make it easier to lift ROE above 4%, in our view, if not quite to the 5% level that the bank says it sees as its cost of equity. This is the progressive relaxation of the Bank of Japans yield curve control policy since July, which has allowed yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds, or JGBs, to rise above 0.5% toward 1.0%. Based on this change, Japan Post Bank has, since summer, started to reverse the investment stance it held since before its IPO allowing its JGB balance to shrink as maturing bonds have been reallocated mainly into foreign bonds. In the future, Japan Post Bank plans to buy newly issued 10-year JGBs at auction, as their yields, above 0.7% now, offer sufficient income to compete with hedged foreign bonds. Longer-term bonds have more interest-rate risk than the three- to five-year bonds that Japan Post Bank typically buys overseas; however, given that Japan Post Banks capital ratio is above 15% and only subject to domestic capital standards, increased purchases of long-term JGBs should be feasible, in our view.","Japan Post Bank trades at less than 0.6 times book value despite most of its assets comprising cash and liquid Japanese government bonds that could theoretically be liquidated at close to par. The Japanese government has financial and political incentives to ensure that the environment supporting Japan Post Banks profitability remains benign.  If Japan Post Bank is able to reduce the size of agency commissions it pays to Japan Post Co. Ltd., profits could rise to levels above current market expectations. ","Supply/demand conditions for Japan Post Bank shares may deteriorate when more shares are offered to the public. Japan Post Banks history as a government agency means it has to develop a commercially minded corporate culture from scratch, and it is unclear if this has yet been achieved. Japan Post Bank trades above 15 times consensus forward earnings, higher than the average of 11 times for Japanese banks.",17/11/2023,"Japan Post Bank has more customer deposits than any other financial institution in Japan (13.2% of all deposits at March 2023) but differs from a typical bank in that it makes few loans and instead invests in securities on the asset side of its huge balance sheet, making it more like a deposit-funded investment pool. It was converted from a former government agency into a business corporation in 2007 and partly privatized in 2015 when its parent company Japan Post Holdings sold an 11% stake to the public. Japan Post Holdings sold more shares in early 2023, bringing its stake in Japan Post Bank below 65%, but there is no specific deadine in the the law that requires full divestment ""as early as possible."" We think Japan Post Bank is likely to remain a subsidiary of government-controlled Japan Post Holdings for the time being, which places a number of restrictions on Japan Post Bank's business activities, such as preventing it from making most loans to consumers or businesses. Given these restrictions and large payments Japan Post Bank makes to Japan Post for use of the post offices, Japan Post Bank has never achieved an annual return on equity higher than 4% (the highest was 3.8% in the year-ended March 2008). We forecast an average of 4.5% over the next three years, higher than in the past but still well below our assumed cost of equity. If Japan Post Bank was privatized and the fees it pays to Japan Post could be reduced, there is potential for return on equity to rise well above 5%, but we do not explicitly project this in our forecast model as the timing is quite uncertain and depends on nonbusiness factors such as politics as much as it depends on commercial considerations.","We do not believe Japan Post Bank has an economic moat. Since 2007, it has never achieved an annual return on equity higher than 4% (the highest was 3.8% in the year ended March 2008). We forecast an average of 4.5% over the next three years, higher than in the past but still well below our assumed cost of equity. It is a company for which the barriers to exit are more meaningful than the barriers to entry, in our view. Given that the majority of assets are either reserves at the central bank or liquid Japanese government bonds, if Japan Post Bank were hypothetically to undertake a liquidation, it could unlock significant value, given that it trades at less than 0.6 times book value. However, we believe it will not contemplate shrinking the size of its balance sheet in the foreseeable future, given the governments majority control of the company and its parent companys legal obligation to provide universal services.","The Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Japan Post Bank is Medium. It makes very few loans and carries less risk overall than other banks, but its interest rate and other risks have been increasing rapidly as its portfolio shifts from Japanese government bonds to a variety of market instruments. Although Japan Post Bank has hired talent from outside in recent years to manage the new portfolio prudently, we are not certain how well this expertise is integrated into the culture of, what was formerly, a government entity and whether the bank will indeed be able to navigate various market cycles without incurring huge losses in future.We believe Japan Post Bank's environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks do not reach the extent where they would prompt us to raise our Uncertainty Rating to High.","We assign a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Poor to Japan Post Bank. The problem we see with Japan Post Bank's capital allocation is not something which lies within the power of company management to fix in the near term, but instead reflect the unique political and legal constraints it faces after having been partially but not completely privatized. In particular, rather than aggressively increasing its credit and market risk by rapidly expanding asset allocations into private equity and real estate, we think shareholders would be better served if Japan Post Bank were to stop using post offices to the degree it does, not only to reduce the fees it pays to Japan Post but to encourage a shrinking of its deposit base and balance sheet, so that it would not be forced to increase its asset risk. However, Japan Post is required by law to maintain universal services and depends at present on receiving fees from Japan Post Bank in order to do so. Also, political considerations inevitably affect management. At the end of 2019, the private-sector heads of Japan Post Holdings, Japan Post Co. and Japan Post Insurance were all forced to resign ostensibly to take responsibility for improper sales of risky insurance products to elderly customers at post-office branches, with former minister of internal affairs and communications Masuda Hiroya becoming president of Japan Post Holdings. Japan Post Banks president Ikeda Norito, a former Bank of Yokohama executive who won recognition for success in overcoming internal opposition to restructuring in the late 1990s, remained in his role, but neither he nor Masuda are able to take some decisions that make sense from the point of view of shareholders but would face political opposition.","Japan Post Bank is the successor of the postal-savings system dating to the Meiji era. It was partially privatized in 2015, when the government sold to the public an 11% stake in parent company Japan Post Holdings, which in turn sold 11% stakes in Japan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance to the public. Japan Post Bank is now 64% owned by Japan Post Holdings, which is majority owned by the government. The law requires Japan Post Holdings to divest itself of Japan Post Bank eventually. Japan Post Bank has 235 direct branches and also accepts deposits and sells investment products at more than 24,000 post offices across the country through a sales-agency agreement with Japan Post (an unlisted subsidiary of Japan Post Holdings). ","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Japan Post Bank. Historically, Japan Post Bank had very high capital ratios because the denominator of the ratios, risk-weighted assets, was very lowgovernment bonds have zero risk weights. As Japan Post Bank has shifted assets away from Japanese government bonds toward risk assets, its capital ratios have declined but are still somewhat higher than those of other Japanese banks. Over the next five years, we expect the ratios to continue declining to levels only slightly above other major Japanese banks. Lacking any branches overseas, Japan Post Bank is not considered to be internationally active and as such is not subject to the Basel III requirements. It does not report total leverage exposure, but if we simply compare Tier 1 capital to its total assets, the ratio4.02% as of March 2023is in line with or even lower than other major Japanese banks, even though Japan Post Bank still has smaller overall asset risk than other banks. In our view, Japan Post Bank may have operational risk arising from the fact that its portfolio shift is relatively recent. The ability to manage the portfolio's new composition has not yet been tested over time.",7182.T,Financial Services,5234565840896.0,JPX,6507800.0,JPY,1468.0,True,0,1241.2858663419388,1472.5838391267762,0
24/11/2023,Singapore Airlines Stays Highly Profitable in Fiscal 2024 but Competition Is Rising,Singapore Airlines Ltd,C6L,4,08/11/2023,Lorraine Tan,6.31,SGD,24/11/2023,7.7,Low,,Standard,,08/11/2023,"We raise our fair value estimate on Singapore Airlines, or SIA, to SGD 7.70 from SGD 7.20 as we lift our fiscal 2026-28 earnings outlook on a higher load factor assumption that offsets a cut to our fiscal 2024-25 profit forecasts. SIAs record fiscal 2024 (ending March) interim net profit of SGD 1.441 billion is in line with our original full-year projection, but we now expect a weaker second-half performance with higher jet fuel costs and weaker yields. SIAs shares are currently undervalued having retreated from its 52-week high of SGD 8.05 set on June 19. For longer-term investors willing to sit through the oil price gyrations, we think select airlines, such as SIA, are attractive but fiscal 2024 is a likely profit peak. Our fair value estimate factors in a normalization in profitability to prepandemic levels, leading to three-year EPS CAGR of negative 5% given the high base in fiscal 2023. Airline share prices have slid on concerns over higher jet fuel costs with crude oil prices rising on OPECs lower planned production. We think investors may stay sidelined given increased risks from a possible spread of the Israel-Hamas war that leads to a supply shock for oil. We think SIAs jet fuel costs will be higher over the next six months but decline from the June 2024 quarter. Passenger load factors remain above historical norm, and this is keeping yields lifted leading to the strong profit performance. SIAs first-half operating profit margin of 17.0% is well above its fiscal 2005-19 average of 5.7%. Given our view for higher costs and rising competition in the second half, we see full-year fiscal 2024 operating margin sliding to 10.9%. We expect SIAs fiscal 2025 net profit to fall 55%. We see international air travel capacity returning to prepandemic levels over the next 12 months, and this is likely to add competition and reduce yields. In addition, cargo yields may stay sluggish for the first half of fiscal 2025 as global growth slows.","SIA's load factors and yields with remain higher for longer given slower capacity builds by competitors. A successful merger between Vistara and Air India provides meaningful returns to SIA's 25% stake. The global economy slows less than expected, leading to a faster recovery in freight demand and higher cargo rates.","The recovery in profits among most airlines is allowing expansion of routes to resume leading to intensive competition that will hurt SIA's profits. Geopolitical risks, such as the Israel-Hamas war, lead to a jump in oil prices hurting profit. Scoot faces added competition and lower profitability given its higher cost base relative to peers in the region.",08/11/2023,"Singapore Airlines, or SIA, is Singapores flagship carrier with a strong brand based on superior cabin service. However, the companys dominance had been weakened in the prepandemic years by low-cost carriers, or LCCs, and the aggressive overseas expansion of the middle east's national carriers and Chinese airlines. While SIA has been building its discount brand Scoot, the proliferation of LCCs, however, made it difficult for SIA to maintain its market share and margins at the same time. However, we think the coronavirus disruption has given SIA a temporary advantage as SIA's financial strength and well planned staff resources enabled the carrier to bring out more flights to capture the rebound in travel demand. We think SIA's profit will likely peak in fiscal 2024 as competition is rising with other international airlines catching up on their route and capacity additions. This is likely to weigh on passenger yields as we suspect SIA will want to keep load factors higher. The airline continues to benefit from improving operating leverage as more aircraft return to service and the higher load factors should see operating margin remain firm in fiscal 2024 before normalizing to prepandemic mid-single-digit levels.  While we anticipate consolidation in the airline industry, past history indicates that capacity does not diminish after pandemics, especially as demand normalizes. As this pandemic has taken longer than expected to recover from and border restrictions remain in some markets, stronger airlines may have an advantage. A strong financial position does allow SIA to upgrade its fleet ahead of other airlines and potentially expand its cargo fleet to take advantage of strong demand. SIA may continue to look for expansion opportunities in faster-growing markets in emerging countries such as its proposed merger of subsidiary Vistara with Air India. However, we expect SIA to focus on strengthening Scoot's services and adjunct activities. ","Consistent with its peer group, we do not believe SIA has an economic moat given an adjusted return in invested capital, or ROIC, that is below its WACC and which will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. Although SIA is a globally recognized airline--named Travel & Leisures ""Best International Airline"" for 25 consecutive years, a brand that is associated with quality service and above average comfort--it is unable to translate this branding into adequate higher pricing. The airline industry is notoriously competitive, and IATA has indicated that the industrys ROIC has not exceeded 8% over the past 15 years. In our midcycle estimate, we see SIAs ROIC at 5.5%, which remains below its WACC of 7.0%. SIAs ROIC has ranged from 3.4% to 8.8% in the previous five fiscal years to March 2020.Prepandemic competition has been intense over the 15 years to 2020 given the proliferation of low-cost carriers, or LCCs, coupled with the rise of Middle East national carriers that target a similar customer segment as SIA. LCCs market share of Asia-Pacific airline travel has grown from 1% in 2001 to over 27% in 2019. This has exerted pressure on the economy class segment of travel. SIAs passenger yield, which reflects the revenue paid by each passenger per kilometer traveled--essentially ticket prices--has largely been flat, ranging within SGD 0.10 and SGD 0.12 over the 15 years. While some cost efficiencies have been achieved, SIA has generally only managed to keep operating profit margins stable versus raising margins. For example, revenue growth has averaged 2.2% while operating expenses have averaged 3.0% over the past 15 years. As such, the operating margin has averaged 5.7%, leaving little room for hiccups. The inability to attain sufficient pricing for its product reflects the excess airline capacity globally. At times SIA has been forced to offer economy fares similar to that of LCCs despite its premium product. In addition, SIAs LCC brand, Scoot, has to compete with regional discount carriers such as AirAsia despite operating in Singapore, which is a higher cost base relative to Malaysia. With the need to constantly upgrade its fleet, SIAs capital expenditure has made up 33% of revenue, averaging SGD 3.1 billion annually since 2009 while cash from operations has averaged SGD 2.4 billion. The spending reflects SIAs aim of keeping a relatively young fleet. The age of its fleet is around 6.5 years versus the average in the Asia-Pacific of around nine years. While we think the young fleet may lead to fuel and maintenance efficiencies, we also think it reflects SIAs strategy of providing a premium product and enables the group to price its fares above market average on the whole, particularly for its business class seats. We dont see this strategy changing despite the current challenges. Although SIAs quick capital-raising exercise and support from the Singapore government gave SIA a strong financial base to weather the pandemic, we think its difficult to see how this will translate into a maintained advantage for SIA. Its possible that financial strife could cut excess capacity in the airline industry but other national airlines, notably the middle-eastern carriers, are expected to remain competitive. As a result, we think yields will revert to normal over the next five years as capacity recovers.","We assign Singapore Airlines a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low, as we believe activity is normalizing and there is now better visibility for a recovery in international air travel recovery with the worst of the coronavirus pandemic closures behind us. However, the risk remains that air travel demand could be dampened by a resurgence in COVID-19. At this current juncture with vaccines rolling out, we think this risk is manageable. Other than such major disruptions, fuel price remains a big risk factor for airlines, and Singapore Airlines is no exception. The company's hedging policy allows hedging up to 24 months forward, and our hedging assumptions are based on the company's guidance. Despite the hedge, it is still reasonable to assume that a jet-fuel price surge would cause a significant deterioration in SIAs earnings prospects. Without domestic flights, SIA heavily relies on the attraction of Singapore as a destination or transit hub. Although Changi Airport offers great amenities, competing regional hubs present threats, in our opinion. Qantas moved its transit hub for its Kangaroo route to Dubai from Singapore. Moreover, economic growth in ASEAN countries has a mixed impact on SIA. High growth would definitely boost air travel traffic across other regions, but it would also justify more nonstop, longer-haul routes, which might bypass Singapore as a transit stop altogether.The key environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks to SIA are in line with its peers. These include carbon emissions, its workforce relations, risk of faulty equipment leading to delays or worse--air crashes, and data privacy breaches. Overall, we think SIA manages its ESG risks relatively well. It maintains a relatively young fleet that is more fuel efficient and which has lower equipment fault risks. Also, pilot strikes are rare in Singapore and so labor relations have been minimally disruptive relative to peers Cathay Pacific and Qantas. ","We assign SIA a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. While SIA's ROIC has not been able to exceed its cost of capital on a maintained basis over the past five years and this is unlikely to change over the next five years, we believe that this is emblematic of the airline industry that is struggling with excess capacity. The proliferation of discount carriers has eaten into SIA's profitability. While SIA is building up its Scoot discount airline brand, the contribution to SIA is still relatively small. Also, SIA has also not found that much success in its investments, having written down its stakes in Virgin Australia and NokScoot. However, we think the merger of Vistara with Air India, is likely to generate positive returns. SIA has emerged operationally relatively well from the pandemic, with an ability to resume flights comfortably, a relatively young fleet and access to experienced flight and cabin crew. In this regard, we are neutral on SIA's ability to generate positive returns from its investments. We think SIA manages its balance sheet relatively well. Prior to the pandemic, SIA's net debt level was relatively comfortable, being in a net cash position through 2017, and net debt would have probably remained below 2 times to EBITDA if not for the pandemic. SIA moved quickly to issue debt and undertake a capital raising exercise in April 2020 in order to ensure it had adequate cash to survive the pandemic. While this was a painful exercise for shareholders, it did remove a key uncertainty. We believe that this move and SIA's balance strength should allow the group to negotiate relatively good payment terms with its suppliers, particularly with aircraft makers and also leaves it in strong standing with aircraft lessors. SIA is redeeming the convertible bonds issued during the pandemic following its record profitability these two years. SIA's dividend payout ranged from 6% to 189% of its net income over the past 10 years to fiscal 2019, which we believe better reflects its prepandemic payout practice. Because of the cyclicality of its earnings, there is great volatility in its dividends. However, we think that its willingness to reward shareholders in this regard is appropriate in light of its investment and fleet renewal requirements. Given the significant cash flow needs in fiscal 2021-22, SIA did not pay any dividends these two years. Dividends resumed in fiscal 2023 and we project a payout of 50% over the next five years. This exceeds the payout ratio we expect for most of the other airlines in our coverage since dividends are SIA's preferred route to reward shareholders instead of share repurchases. ","Singapore Airlines is Singapore's flagship carrier and one of the regions largest airlines in revenue and carrying capacity. The companys hub is Changi Airport, providing regional and cross-continental passenger and cargo services destined to or transit through Singapore. The company operates under dual brands: the premium carrier, SIA, coupled with its wholly owned subsidiary, and the low-cost regional carrier Scoot. It also owns stakes in SATs and SIA Engineering. ","Singapore Airlines is emerging from the pandemic in a strong financial position. The rights issue of new equity, completed in fiscal 2021, helped lower its net gearing back to a more comfortable net gearing position of 20%. The sale and leaseback of 11 aircraft in May 2021 added an additional SGD 2 billion to cash, providing additional flexibility. In 2021, SIA also exercised its option to issue more medium-term notes. All in, and with its return to positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2022, SIA is now sitting on net cash, which gave the group the flexibility to redeem its convertible bonds to avoid the step up in interest costs.

24/11/2023,Inventory Correction Mostly Completed; Auto Demand Drives Long-Term Growth,Yageo Corp,2327,4,27/10/2023,Kazunori Ito,575.0,TWD,24/11/2023,670.0,High,,Standard,,27/10/2023,"Two multilayer ceramic capacitor, or MLCC, suppliers, Samsung Electro Mechanics and Yageo, reported their September-quarter results on Oct. 26. As the stock reaction after the results showed, the two companies' results were in stark contrast. While Samsung Electro Mechanics', or Semco's, stock price dropped more than 10% after the results because of the unexpected margin contraction, Yageo's stock price rose about 5% on the next day after the results because of the solid margin outlook. Although Semco's results imply intensifying competition in MLCC, we are still optimistic that the company will grow at a faster pace than the market, driven by the share gains in MLCC for automobiles. We will revise our earnings forecasts as well as our fair value estimates after meeting with the companies, so for now we maintain our fair value estimates of KRW 210,000 for Semco and TWD 670 for Yageo. We believe that both companies are undervalued. In contrast to Semco, Yageo's September-quarter results were solid. Revenues were up 2.4% sequentially, gross margin was flat at 33.2%, and operating margin improved to 19.7% from 19.0% in the June quarter due to lower operating expenses. For the December quarter, the company guided for a mid-single-digit sequential revenue decline because of the seasonality with a flat gross and operating margins, suggesting that Yageo's business is not affected by the price competition mentioned on Semco's earnings call. We believe that the difference between Yageo and Semco in terms of MLCC price competition is caused by Semco's product mix, which has more overlap with Japanese competitors, while Yageo has less direct competition. We expect solid margin expansion for Yageo next year as the utilization rate for high-margin products such as MLCCs and tantalum capacitors will start to increase after the completion of the inventory adjustment is completed.","Yageo will benefit from increasing passive components demand, driven by the content growth in 5G smartphones and autos. As Japanese competitors move away from commoditized products, the supply/demand balance of commoditized MLCC will be extremely tight, enabling Yageo to raise the pricing. As a result of acquiring Kemet, Yageo will be able to expand its MLCC business quickly in the auto industry.","While suppliers expand their production capacity, demand will be weaker than anticipated, which leads to a price war. Larger players, Murata Manufacturing and Semco will decide allocating its resources to commoditized MLCC, which leads to intensifying competition. Yageos product portfolio is too weak to absorb the cyclicality of the technology industry.",31/07/2023,"Yageo is one of the leading passive components suppliers in Taiwan. Passive components are widely used in all kinds of electronic applications, and necessary to stabilize and control electric flow, and to remove electromagnetic noise from circuits. Yageos main products are chip resistors and multilayer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs, in which it is ranked first and third in global production volume, respectively. Over the past decade, growth of passive components has been driven by smartphones. Faster communication and processing speed require larger power consumption for smartphones, and therefore, more passive components were necessary to enable longer battery life. We think the trend will accelerate, along with the diffusion of 5G communication. In addition, an increasing number of electronic devices, triggered by the introduction of strict environment and safety regulations, will be a growth driver of passive components in the longer term. As a result, we forecast solid demand of passive components will continue. While Japanese players are moving away from commoditized components to focus their resources more on premium smartphones, telecom base stations, and automobiles, Yageo filled the gap by aggressively expanding its production capacities. Yageos production capacity for MLCC was 80 billion per month by the end of 2020 and the company plans to add another 15%-20% in the second half 2022 with its new Kaohsiung plant. We believe Yageo will continue to benefit from the increasing demand of passive components, as we forecast Japanese competitors are not able to fulfill all demands especially from autos and base stations. Yageo is also aggressively implementing a merger and acquisition strategy. Following the acquisition of Pulse Electronics in 2018 and Kemet in 2020, Yageo fully consolidated Chilisin in January 2022, which will not only reinforce Yageos product portfolio, but also contribute expanding its footprint in autos and industrials. In October 2022, the company announced agreement to acquire two sensor business units, which is in line with this strategy in our view.","We do not believe Yageo merits an economic moat because of the commodity nature of its main products, multilayer ceramic capacitors and chip resistors. While we forecast Yageos ROIC will constantly go over WACC for the next five years, we mainly attribute it to the robust demand from smartphones and autos, but do not believe Yageo possesses a technological advantage or a better product mix to protect its pricing in a downturn.MLCCs, store electricity and stabilize electric flow, which are necessary to enable longer battery life and remove electromagnetic noise, and are thus used for all electronic circuits. We estimate MLCC comprises approximately two thirds of Yageos revenue and the company is the third-largest supplier of MLCC in volume and the fifth-largest player in revenue with 6% market share, following other Asian suppliers; Murata Manufacturing (40% market share), Samsung Electro-Mechanics (19%), Taiyo Yuden (13%), and TDK (8%). The number of MLCCs per unit has been constantly increasing because of: 1) Larger power consumption on smartphones driven by faster processing and communication speed; and 2) More electronic devices per automobile to meet environmental and safety regulations, and suppliers have been benefitted from the tight supply/demand balance over the past few years.We acknowledge that the larger requirements for passive components urged Japanese competitors to withdraw from commoditized products. For instance, MLCC for autos and telecom base stations require more stability in severe conditions, and thus it takes a longer time to qualify specification tests. On the other hand, MLCC for smartphones are becoming extremely small because circuit boards are becoming more crowded. As suppliers are not able to fulfill all the demand, it is reasonable for Japanese suppliers to focus on such high-end products, where competition is moderate with fewer players, and thus they can expect higher and stable pricing.After Japanese suppliers moved away from commoditized MLCCs, we think Yageo filled the supply gap, and succeeded in increasing MLCCs' pricing when the supply/demand balance significantly tightened in 2018. As a result, Yageos MLCC revenue jumped to TWD 47 billion in 2018 from TWD 17 billion in 2017, and its entire gross margin expanded to 63.3% in 2018 from 32.5% in 2017, as we estimate that Yageo increased MLCC pricing by more than three times. However, along with the economic slowdown, the company lost two thirds of its revenue and the gross margin drastically dropped to 31.0% in third-quarter 2019 from 69.3% on the previous year. Therefore, we believe favorable MLCC pricing was solely determined by the supply/demand balance, suggesting Yageo doesn't possess sufficient pricing power.We think Yageo doesn't possess a better product mix, technological advantage, or solid customer base, which mitigates the cyclicality. For instance, while we forecast that Yageo and Taiyo Yudens production volume is almost the same, Taiyo Yudens MLCC revenue is twice as much as Yageos, because Taiyo Yuden enjoys premium pricing on MLCCs for flagship smartphones and telecom base stations. In addition, Yageo sells 40%-50% of its products through distributers, which is much higher than Japanese suppliers at 15%. We believe this difference also supports our view that Yageo is specialized in producing commoditized components, but has lower revenue proportion of customized/premium components.Chip resistors are necessary to manage and control electric current, and to protect all electronic circuits, and these comprise one fourth of Yageos revenue. Unlike MLCCs, the chip resistors market is more fragmented and Yageo is the global top supplier in volume, followed by Japanese firms such as KOA, Rohm, and Panasonic. While we estimate that Yageos production volume is about four times larger than KOAs, resistor revenue of both companies is approximately the same, which implies that KOAs average pricing is much higher than Yageos. We attribute this to the difference in the revenue proportion from the auto industry, which is 15%-20% and 45%-50% for Yageo and KOA, respectively. Moreover, as we have seen on MLCC, Yageos chip resistor revenue increased to TWD 26 billion in 2018 from TWD 13 billion in 2017, but then fell back to TWD 12 billion in 2019. Again, we conclude Yageo does not possess a pricing power for chip resistors because the company focuses on commodity products for consumer electronic usage.Among our passive components coverage, we assign narrow moat to Murata Manufacturing. Yageos operating margin looks higher than that of Murata, but it is owing to the difference of its product portfolio. In fact, operating margin of Muratas passive components is higher than that of Yageo. Moreover, although Muratas operating margin on Wi-Fi module and RF front module is lower than MLCC, we believe that module business is one of the important factors constituting its economic moat. Muratas larger market share and wider product portfolio on major communication components (40% on MLCC, 50% on SAW filter, 35% on EMI filter, 40% on LC filter, and 55% on Wi-Fi module) enables the company to establish relationships with all key players in the telecom supply chain, which is beneficial for the company to grasp future product roadmaps earlier than its peers.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Yageo is High.The passive components business is a high gross margin business, which requires heavy capital expenditure, and thus, it is vulnerable to economic fluctuations. Because its gross margin is high, the utilization rate of facilities is critical for profitability. Consequently, in a downturn, suppliers often decide to cut pricing aggressively so they can get more orders from customers, in order to keep the utilization rates as high as possible. Moreover, suppliers tend to pile up inventories when demand is weak because they do not want to cut down the utilization rates. As a result, under an economic downturn, suppliers usually suffer from both the lower utilization rate and price declines, exaggerating the cyclicality. On the other hand, when robust demand tightens the supply/demand balance, the pricing of passive components increases immediately. In fact, Yageos operating margin has ranged between 9% to 48% over the past decade.While Yageos production facilities are in China and Taiwan, electronic components are usually traded in United States dollars. Therefore, Yageos profitability is influenced by the movement of foreign exchange rates.Yageo does not face any material, company-specific environmental, social, and governance risks, which may affect our economic moat rating and uncertainty rating. The company pays particular attention to emission and energy consumption as the production of passive components consumes a large amount of electricity. Yageo fully acquired the U.S. passive components supplier Kemet in 2020, and before the acquisition, NEC Tokin, a subsidiary of Kemet was fined by the European Commission for colluding to manipulate the prices for aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors between 1998 and 2012. We do not think this will be the material risk factor for the company as the issue occurred before the Kemet acquisition.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Yageo is Standard.Yageos mainstay product, multilayer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs, require heavy investment due to the process of stacking hundreds to thousands of layers of ceramic sheets and sintering them at temperatures of 1,000 degrees or higher. In fact, driven by robust MLCC demand, Yageo invested 12% of revenue on average for capital expenditure over the past three years. That said, MLCC suppliers must find a good balance between heavy capital expenditure, strategic acquisition, shareholder return, and financial health. From this point of view, we believe Yageos capital allocation is reasonable.We believe Yageo is implementing strategic M&As effectively to enhance its product portfolio, enabling the company to become more resilient to economic fluctuations. In particular, the acquisition of Kemet in 2020, a U.S.-based passive components supplier, which specialized in auto, was effective in our view, as Yageo was able to expand the product portfolio and client base at once. Unlike the past, Yageo pursues making long-term contracts with key customers by supplying specialized products, so the company can maximize long-term profits. We believe Yageos recent acquisitions of Pulse, Kemet, and Chilisin are in line with this strategy.We expect Yageo's dividend payout ratio will drop to 30%-40% in our explicit five-year forecast, which is in line with its peers, as the company may focus on expanding production capacity for tantalum capacitors and ceramic capacitors to meet massive demand from auto, but we still think it is at a reasonable level.","Yageo Corp produces passive components for electronic devices. Passive components are necessary for all electronic circuits, and they are used to stabilize and control the electric flow and remove electromagnetic noise from the circuit. Yageos main products are MLCC, chip resistors, inductors, and tantalum capacitors, which are ranked third, first, third, and first in global production volume, respectively.","Yageos balance sheet is not highly leveraged, which is usual for passive component suppliers. Passive-component businesses require heavy capital expenditures and their profitability is highly affected by the economic cycle. Therefore, a healthy balance sheet and solid cash flow are necessary to continue investing, which is important to maintain a competitive edge in the industry.As Japanese suppliers are focusing their resources on premium products to avoid competition and thus are unable to fulfill commodity components demands, Yageo plans to increase its MLCC production capacity by 15%-20% in the second half 2023 with its new Kaohsiung plant to take this opportunity. Meanwhile, the company intends to strengthen its product portfolio and expand its footprint in the automotive industry through an aggressive M&A strategy. In the past five years, Yageo has announced the acquisition of Pulse, Kemet, Chilisin, Heraeus Nexensos, and Telemecanique Sensors. However, Yageo's debt-equity ratio is around 0.5 at the end of 2022, which is at the lowest level in the past decade.",2327.TW,Technology,251076247552.0,TAI,1541287.0,TWD,545.0,True,1,511.23493975903614,576.038961038961,1
24/11/2023,CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust's Diversified Portfolio Underpins Earnings Resilience,CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust,C38U,5,26/10/2023,Xinfu Lee,1.88,SGD,24/11/2023,2.32,Low,Narrow,Exemplary,,26/10/2023,"We retained our fair value estimate of SGD 2.32 per unit for CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, or CICT, after the in-line third-quarter 2023 business update. The trust's cumulative nine months' revenue and net property income grew 9.8% and 6.8% year on year, respectively, to SGD 1,166 million and SGD 827 million. This made up 75% and 74% of our full-year estimates, respectively. The slight miss on net property income is due to cost inflation pressure on its operating expense, and management expects net property income margin to improve as it focuses on cost management in the coming months. Following the recent selloff of CICT's units, we think the trust is currently undervalued and trades at an attractive 2024 dividend yield of 6.5%. For its office portfolio, the trust continues to improve its office portfolio occupancy rate to 96.4% for the September quarter from 95.4% in the previous quarter. The improvement is largely driven by its Singapore portfolio occupancy that rose 1.4 percentage points, quarter-on-quarter to 98.0% as Capital Tower, CapitaGreen, and Six Battery Road hit occupancy rates of 97.4%, 97.1% and 97.9%, respectively. Positives aside, the office market in Sydney remains challenging, with vacancy rates hitting 14.5% and 20.8%, respectively, for Sydney and North Sydney Central Business District, according to Jones Lang LaSalle. This is reflected in CICT's Australian office occupancy rate that declined 1.1 percentage points, quarter on quarter, to 87.7%. We expect the Sydney office market to remain lackluster for CICT in 2024 as new offices continue to be completed and added to the supply. We anticipate a recovery from 2025 onward, once the excess supply is absorbed.","CICT has a strong and supportive sponsor with a large pipeline of commercial and retail assets for acquisition. The trusts management has a solid record of delivering distribution per unit growth through leasing, asset-enhancement initiatives, and portfolio reconstitution. Its diversified tenant base and well-spread lease expiry profile underpin a stable earnings profile through economic cycles.","A concentrated portfolio in Singapore means that CICT is leveraged to any deterioration in the economic conditions in the city-state.  Increases in interest rates will raise financing costs and cost of capital, making it harder to identify yield-accretive acquisitions and grow distributions per unit.  The rise of online and mobile shopping puts pressure on leasing demand for retail space as traditional retailers reduce their physical store count and move online.",01/08/2023,"CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust owns a portfolio of income-producing office and retail assets that are predominantly in Singapore; assets in Germany and Australia make up less than 10% of its portfolio. The trusts suburban malls are located in densely populated residential areas while its downtown malls are in popular shopping and tourist destinations. All its retail malls are close to mass transport hubs, which helps to generate a high volume of shopper footfall and drive sales growth for its tenant base. Favorable locations, high shopper traffic, and growing annual sales are highly desirable features for tenants, allowing CICT to charge premium rents relative to average market rates.  On the office front, CICT is the largest landlord of Grade A office buildings in Singapores central business district. Its office buildings command premium rents as they are highly coveted for their quality office space and proximity to businesses and key transport nodes. In addition, CICTs tenant base is one of the best in class, with large global investment banks and sovereign wealth funds on its register.  CICT has actively employed a mixture of leasing, asset-enhancement initiatives, or AEIs, and portfolio reconstitution to increase its assets under management and distributions per unit. In terms of leasing, we note that the trust has managed to consistently achieve positive rental reversions for most of the historical period while maintaining high occupancy rates. It also has a strong record of pursuing AEIs to rejuvenate and upgrade its assets to enhance its offerings. The trust occasionally participates in riskier redevelopment projects with higher payoffs, such as the recently completed CapitaSpring. On the portfolio reconstitution front, the trust has continually executed on its strategy to divest low-yielding, nonperforming assets and recycling the proceeds into better-quality assets with higher yields. We expect the trust to continue with these approaches to improve the quality of its portfolio and create value for its unitholders.","We believe CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust has a narrow economic moat, derived from efficient scale from its Singapore retail and office assets. CICTs retail and office assets in Singapore effectively and efficiently serves its own submarkets and its business is protected from competition by factors such as mature demand, excess capacity, significant barriers to entry and historical precedent. It is worth noting that CICT has two office assets in Frankfurt, Germany, and one hospitality asset in Singapore contributing a combined 9% of net property income that we assign a no-moat rating.CICT have both suburban and downtown retail assets that individually serve a localized and mature demand for retail space in its respective submarkets. Its suburban properties are in densely populated residential areas while its downtown retail properties are in popular shopping and tourist destinations. All the retail assets are situated on or adjacent to major subway stations and transport hubs that generates a high volume of commuter traffic. This translates into recurring shopper traffic for the malls tenants and drive leasing demand for the malls retail space. At the same time, we do not expect leasing demand to rise quickly such that it attracts new entrants in CICTs submarkets due to the slow population growth in Singapore (1.1% per year from 2010 to 2020), and structural shifts in the sector caused by the continued growth of e-commerce and recent rise of mobile commerce. The result of the latter creates an environment where retailers are careful and selective when picking a physical location to open. Mall owners will need to recognize the important role they play in helping retailers pursue a successful omnichannel strategy and help them converge their online-and-offline retail business to provide shoppers with a seamless shopping experience. That said, we think that sophisticated mall operators with scale such as CICT have shown that it can take advantage of and capture this growing demand. This was demonstrated through the redevelopment of Funan into Singapore first O&O shopping mall with integrated infrastructure such as 24-hour click-and-collect drive-through that attracted popular e-tailer Love, Bonito to establish a store there.The majority of CICTs office assets are in the central business district, where it dominates the Grade A office space. CICT and its Sponsor, CapitaLand, is the biggest landlord of office buildings in the Singapore CBD and we estimate that they collectively control 20% of the Grade A CBD supply (including the Tanjong Pagar submarket). This goes up to 30% if we exclude the Marina Bay area. Singapores business friendly environment and well-educated workforce appeals to international companies looking to set up a headquarter office in Asia Pacific. The CBD is also the primary choice for most companies to set up an office due to its accessibility and proximity to other businesses. With respect to the competition for tenants, we think that landlords with multiple properties within a city, such as CICT, have a slight competitive advantage over landlords with single assets. This is because it has access to a larger database of tenants and holds an information advantage through constant communication with its tenants on their leasing requirements. It will have the firsthand knowledge on any tenants change in leasing requirements and can also easily move the tenants around to its other properties within the city that can meet the tenants needs.Town planning restrictions, lack of suitable sites and prohibitively expensive land are significant barriers to entry that helps to prevent the establishment of competing malls and offices nearby. As Singapore is a small city-state, the Urban Redevelopment Authority is very careful in developing and drafting Singapores Concept Plan and Master Plan that maximizes the use of land. In order to avoid an oversupply situation that destabilizes the real estate market, the State, as the largest owner of undeveloped land in Singapore, tightly controls the sale of land to developers though the Sale of Sites program managed by URA. In addition, the nature of land is such that there can only be one or two prime locations in each submarket. These are usually the plot that is uniquely above or adjacent to a major subway station or bus interchange and once a building is built there, there will not be a second plot that will be as prime as the first. We think this concept is especially true for retail assets where we find that competing malls, even if they are 5 mins walk away or across the road, need to spend more and work harder to attract shopper traffic and may still struggle when compared with the main mall. As an example, one of CICTs asset, Bedok Mall, located adjacent to the Bedok MRT station has enjoyed high occupancy rates above 99% since it was opened in late 2013. Its competitor, Bedok Point, suffered a dip in occupancy after Bedok Malls opening and had to endure vacancy rates up to 20% in the last five years. Bedok Point has since been sold and is being redeveloped into a mixed-use development. As for Singapores CBD where the majority of CICTs office assets are located, it is worth noting that the existing building density is very high, and the remaining land available for development is mostly found at the Marina Bay area (where only one asset, Asia Square Tower 2 is located). As CICTs malls and offices already take up the prime locations in its respective submarket, by virtue of being located near key transport hubs and the CBD, competitors faced significant risk developing competitive assets within the same submarkets even if they can overcome the regulatory hurdle, secure a suitable site and afford the prohibitively expensive land prices.As the largest retail and CBD office landlord in Singapore, CICT has the financial ability and means to regularly revitalize its assets through asset-enhancement initiatives and proactive leasing that allows CICT to meet incremental demands of tenants at lower costs than greenfield development. Expiring leases, which are a natural feature of operating a building, generates vacancies that are opportunities to improve the tenant and trade mix through low-cost leasing activities. AEIs, on the other hand, require higher capital outlay but can add significant value through improving the appeal and maintaining the relevance of the buildings. CICT has demonstrated this ability through active lease management and have also regularly executed AEIs. Examples include the ongoing AEIs on Six Battery Road, 21 Collyer Quay and Lot One. We also think the constant improvement to the asset premises and quality will ultimately attract better quality tenants as we find that tenants tend to upgrade to better-quality premises (downgrading to lower-quality premises may be a sign that the tenant is not in good shape). This also explains why CICT can maintain a high-quality tenant register for its office buildings featuring the likes of JPMorgan, GIC, and Temasek while its malls continually maintain high shopper traffic and occupancy rates. As the use of buildings will constantly evolve with time, we believe that landlords like CICT with its successful track record will continue to strengthen its assets and discourage competitors from entering the market.We think that the CICTs asset performance is a testament to its own quality. On the leasing front, we observed that tenants are extremely sticky with average retention rates above 80% for retail and 70% for office. This is in addition to the fact that the rents charged by CICT are at the higher range in the market. This implies that CICTs assets are rated highly by tenants for its location and quality and are willing to pay premium rents for the space. As a result, CICT was able to maintain occupancy rates that are higher than the rest of Singapore over the past decade, and even through the global financial crisis and current coronavirus outbreak. While CICT is not immune to a severe economic decline, in a bear-case scenario, we expect its tested and proven properties to outperform its peers.We forecast CICT to generate an average return on invested capital of 7.6% over the next five years. This includes long-term capital appreciation of 3% annually for properties in Singapore. The five-year ROIC exceeds CICT's weighted cost of capital of 6.8% and supports our view that CICT possesses a narrow economic moat.We do not expect environmental, social, and governance risk to materially affect CICTs economic moat. The key ESG issues faced by Singapore REITs in general are higher cost of utilities (water and electricity) and conflicts associated with an external REIT management structure. CICT actively manages its energy and water consumption by incorporating green building technologies such as installation of 1,700 square meters of solar panels on some buildings to generate renewable energy and harvesting rainwater for nonpotable purposes. It has also set out a goal (using 2008 as base year) to reduce water use intensity by 45%, energy use intensity by 35% and carbon emission intensity by 78% by 2030. Also, as CICT is an externally managed REIT that is under the control of its sponsor, potential conflict of interest may arise due to misalignment of interest from fee incentives and situations where the sponsor is the counter party in an asset acquisition or disposal. We think such risks are well-managed as CICT exhibits a high standard of corporate governance that is occasionally beyond the best practice set out by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in the Code on Collective Investment Schemes when dealing with an acquisition or disposal of asset with the Sponsor who is an interested party. Example of this would be the waiver of acquisition fees for the merger that created CICT. The manager of CICT also charges one of the lowest base fees when compared with its peers and its performance fee is linked to net property income and net investment income, which should generally align the manager with unitholders as it rewards the manager for good performance in the form of improvements to both rental income and property expenses.","Our Low Morningstar Uncertainty Rating reflects CICTs stable earnings profile throughout the economic cycle, driven by its diversified portfolio consisting of offices, retail malls and integrated development. Its portfolio of strategically located and uniquely positioned assets coupled with active management, which includes asset-enhancement initiatives and redevelopment, can ensure its assets remain appealing to tenants and consumers. The diversified nature of its tenant base and its limited reliance on any single tenant helps to support its stable earnings profile. With most of its properties located in Singapore, the key risk is a significant deterioration in the economic activities there. A significant decline in economic activity and consumer spending in Singapore and the region would deter domestic and international firms from expanding, and lead to lower leasing demand from retailers. This, coupled with a significant increase in supply of office and retail space, especially near its existing properties, may result in downward pressure on rents and higher vacancy rates. That said, we believe that its well staggered lease expiry profile along with its diversified property type and tenant base could lower the risk of a significant decline in rental in any single year, particularly during an economic downturn.CICT is also exposed to the risk of interest rate hikes as a significant increase in interest rates would increase financing costs and erode distributions to unitholders. That said, the trusts policy to hedge at least 80% of its outstanding debt at fixed interest rates, staggered debt maturity profile, and manageable gearing ratio would help to mitigate sudden adverse movements in interest rates. We believe that CICTs environmental, social, and governance risks are low and immaterial to the company. We therefore do not expect material value destruction from ESG issues to undermine the economic moat.","We assign an Exemplary rating to CICTs capital allocation. In our opinion, the trusts balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are exceptional, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.We view CICTs balance sheet as sound as its gearing ratio of around 40.4% is below the regulatory threshold of 50%. We think it is a manageable level as it leaves some debt headroom for future acquisitions and asset-enhancement initiatives that can create value for unitholders. With a high occupancy rate of 95.8% and weighted average lease expiry of 3.7 years (as of Dec. 31, 2022), CICT has relatively low revenue cyclicality and will display resilience during an economic downturn, in our view. We do not expect the trust to experience any refinancing risk, given its healthy gearing and well-staggered debt maturity profile. We view CICTs investment decisions as exceptional as the trust has historically achieved success in growing net property income and distribution per unit via AEIs, redevelopment, and portfolio reconstitution. Following the merger between CapitaLand Mall Trust and CapitaLand Commercial Trust in 2020, the trust has embarked on a series of AEIs on its retail malls and offices to rejuvenate and upgrade its assets to stay relevant and attract tenants. The trust has also recently completed the redevelopment of Golden Shoe Car Park into an integrated development comprising Grade A offices, serviced residences, ancillary retail and a food center called CapitaSpring, which will help to contribute to CICTs distributions. On the portfolio reconstitution front, we like the trusts move to divest low-yielding, nonperforming assets and recycle the proceeds into better-quality assets with higher yields. We expect the trust to continue to make exceptional investment decisions to create value for its unitholders.The trusts distribution policy is to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to unitholders, in line with the regulatory requirement to enjoy tax exemptions. Historically we note that the trust has paid out more than 95% of its distributable income to reward unitholders, retaining a small amount of distributable income for capital expenditure purposes. We think that this is appropriate and expect the trust to continue this capital return strategy.","CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust was established following the merger between CapitaLand Mall Trust and CapitaLand Commercial Trust in October 2020. The trust has a diversified portfolio of 26 properties, which includes offices (mainly in the central business district), retail malls (includes urban and suburban malls), and integrated development. Most of its properties are located in Singapore, with assets in Germany and Australia making up less than 10% of its portfolio. The trust is externally managed by CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust Management; parent CapitaLand retains a 23% stake in CICT.","CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust is in good financial health. As of Dec. 31, 2022, gearing of 40.1% is well below the 50% regulatory limit. This implies that asset values need to fall 19% in order to breach this limit, which we think is unlikely. CICT has a well-staggered debt maturity profile with an average debt maturity of 3.9 years. The interest coverage ratio is at a healthy 3.9 times, above the minimum of 2.5 times required for the 50% regulatory gearing limit (gearing ratio is limited to 45% for REITs with ICRs below 2.5 times). All-in cost of debt remains low at 2.7%, with fixed-rate debt accounting for around 81% of total debt outstanding. We project the effective interest rate to rise slightly from the current level over the next five years due to interest-rate hikes in the coming years. We do not expect the trust to experience any issues in refinancing remaining debt maturities of SGD 1,166 million in 2023. We think the trust is well positioned to take on additional debt for future acquisitions and asset-enhancement initiatives when the opportunities arise.",C38U.SI,Real Estate,12449936384.0,SES,14300000.0,SGD,1.8799999952316284,True,1,1.8106894890488097,1.9196520469204819,1
24/11/2023,Aon Should Enjoy Stable But Modest Growth Over Time,Aon PLC,AON,2,27/10/2023,Brett Horn,328.98,USD,23/11/2023,291.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,27/10/2023,"Aon reported solid third-quarter results that reflect a favorable industry backdrop, but its results continue to lag its closest peer. Overall revenue grew 10% year over year, or 6% on an organic basis. Organic growth is still a bit above what we expect long-term. We will maintain our $291 fair value estimate for the narrow-moat company and see shares as slightly overvalued. Year-over-year growth in the Commercial Risk and Reinsurance segments was 4% and 11%, respectively, on an organic basis. We think the tailwind from better primary insurance pricing may be starting to ebb, but a stronger reinsurance market is picking up the slack to some extent. This area of the business is also benefiting from higher interest rates and better fiduciary income, which boosted overall growth by 2 percentage points. The Health and Wealth segment followed recent trends with 10% and 4% year-over-year growth, respectively, on an organic basis. We think the Health segment has much better long-term growth prospects longer-term. Adjusted operating margins improved to 24.3% from 23.1% last year. The increase appears to be entirely because of better fiduciary income, which falls almost completely to the bottom line. Excluding this factor, we believe margins would have compressed modestly. Management announced a cost savings plan that will include a $900 million charge but should result in $350 million in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2026. Aon, in this respect, seems to be following the lead of Marsh McLennan, which recently announced a similar plan. We think the failed Willis Towers Watson merger might take large-scale M&A off the table for Aon, and a greater focus on efficiency would be an appropriate pivot.","The tollbooth nature of its brokerage operations makes Aon a relatively stable producer of free cash flow. Aons established corporate relationships provide an opportunity to enter and cross-sell new services and move into a larger risk-management role over time. Management estimates that the top four global brokers have only about 30% market share, leaving plenty of space to expand without intense head-to-head competition.","Aon's established position in relatively mature markets lowers its long-term growth prospects. Aon has historically shown a willingness to expand into new areas, and this could potentially dilute its moat. Aon has aggressively repurchased stock in recent years, implying that management sees little opportunity for value-creative reinvestment.",10/10/2023,"Aon historically has demonstrated modest growth and strong and stable free cash flow, and we expect much of the same going forward, although swings in the insurance market and the pandemic have created some recent ups and downs. In our view, Aon is a fundamentally attractive business, with a variety of operations that share the commonality of sticky customer relationships, limited capital requirements, and flexible cost structures.  In recent years, Aon saw a modest headwind turn into a tailwind. Because Aon generally takes a percentage of premiums as commission, it is exposed to the direction of the insurance pricing cycle. In 2019, pricing momentum picked up, and this positive trend accelerated in 2020. as the coronavirus appears to have acted as an additional spur to pricing. Pricing increases haven't been this strong in almost 20 years. This has boosted Aon's growth a bit in the near term and has helped offset any negative impacts the coronavirus has on the more discretionary areas of the business. With discretionary services now bouncing back as the pandemic recedes, Aon saw unusually strong growth over the past couple of years. But these tailwinds should dissipate over time. Aon has been busy in recent years, taking bold steps to reshape its business and improve its efficiency. Before the pandemic, Aon announced its intention to merge with Willis Towers Watson in a $30 billion all-stock deal. This deal was called off in July after resistance from U.S. regulators, and Aon paid a $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. While management will have to take a step back and reassess following the failure to complete the Willis Towers Watson merger, we think management has a good record when it comes to balancing expansion opportunities and maintaining the companys competitive position, which gives us confidence. We also like that Aon has been focusing on improving cost efficiency.","Aon's relatively sticky client base and its global presence are the main sources for its narrow economic moat. Through its risk solutions segment, Aon acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients to manage their risk by negotiating and placing their insurance risks with insurance carriers through its global distribution network. Insurance brokers such as Aon are uniquely positioned to serve a necessary risk management function. Brokers can search the insurance market more efficiently and effectively than individual buyers, helping clients to compare insurers' skills, financial strengths, and reputation. During the matching process, brokers also help insurers solve problems related to asymmetric information, such as adverse selection and moral hazard. The complexity of these services creates switching costs, as we believe the value of changing providers is not clear to customers and there is perceived value for the client in continuing to work with a broker that has experience in managing their risk. As a result, Aons client retention rates are typically over 90%. While 80% of Aons clients are middle-market companies, Aons global presence limits potential competition at the top end of the corporate market as it allows Aon to effectively serve multinational customers that smaller brokers cannot. Additionally, the scale and breadth of its operations allows the company to build out a wider set of data and experience, which we believe improves the value of its services even at the middle-market level.Aon's human resources business is more diffuse and operates in several markets with differing levels of competition. Operating margins, excluding purchase amortization expenses and one-time charges, have been lower than on the brokerage side historically, suggesting this side of the business is not as advantaged as brokerage operations but still benefits from relatively sticky customer relationships. The sale of its benefits administration and human resources BPO business eliminated the lowest-margin business on this side, however.Ultimately, we see Aon as a relatively stable business that benefits from minimal capital requirements and enduring relationships. Returns on invested capital excluding goodwill have been trending in a positive direction and are multiples above any reasonable estimate of the cost of capital.","On the brokerage side, Aons primary exposure is to the insurance pricing cycle, as commissions are often calculated as a percentage of premium. However, insurance is also a heavily regulated industry, which can affect Aon as well. The brokerage industry has historically had some material issues on the regulatory front. On the human resources side, Aons exposure is primarily to the health of the employment market and general macroeconomic conditions, as any headwinds in these areas could limit clients' willingness to pay for Aons services. Aons largest cost component by far is employee compensation, which could lead to pressure on margins if labor conditions grew tight and any large-scale employee defections could damage the business. Aons international footprint creates currency and operational risks.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we view the largest risk for Aon and other brokers as business ethics and managing potential conflicts of interest. Historically, the industry has had issues with contract structures such as contingent commissions. However, we see no major flags at the moment for Aon.","Our capital allocation rating for Aon is Exemplary. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.Greg Case has served as CEO since 2005 and has made major changes to the organization during his tenure that we believe have been mostly value-creative. Under his watch, the companys business has shifted from an insurance-focused organization into a provider of a wider set of risk management tools. We believe Case deserves credit for embarking on a fairly aggressive path to reposition the business, and more importantly for doing so in a manner that did not dilute the moat surrounding its legacy operations.In 2008, Aon made two major moves. First, it sold its insurance underwriting operations. In our view, this move away from capital-intensive operations was a material positive. Also in 2008, Aon acquired Benfield Group, a leading reinsurance broker, in a move that expanded its reinsurance brokerage capabilities and global reach. We believe Aons global footprint is a key factor in its competitive positioning at the top end of the brokerage market and therefore view this move positively from a moat perspective.Aon acquired Hewitt Associates, a leading HR consulting and outsourcing firm, in 2010 for $4.3 billion. This deal nearly tripled the size of the company's consulting business, making it far less reliant on its insurance brokerage operations. Small bolt-on acquisitions further expanded its noninsurance operations and created some balance to the firms operations. While this expansion moved Aons away from its core business and synergies between the two sides of the business are limited, we see a reasonable strategic connection and do not believe the expansion has meaningfully diluted Aons overall competitive position. After years of contenting itself with relatively small deals, Aon announced in 2020 that it would merge with Willis Towers Watson in an all-stock deal. Management suggested that the strategic rationale for the deal primarily hinged on building a larger entity that is more capable of improving data and analytic capabilities in order to better adjust to the new types of risks clients are facing. This didnt strike us as a deeply compelling rationale, and the deal was ultimately called off due to regulatory concerns. While this ended up being a poor use of management's time and Aon was forced to pay a $1 billion termination fee, we don't see the failure to complete this deal as a significant blow to the company's competitive position.In recent years, the majority of Aon's free cash flow has been used to buy back shares, supporting the idea that the aggressive moves earlier in Cases tenure were not simply empire building but part of a thoughtful plan to reposition the business. The sale of a substantial portion of the human resources business, while it marked something of a reversal of course by offloading some of the assets acquired in the Hewitt deal, supports this point. The history of the industry suggests M&A will always be part of the company's strategy, but the failure to complete the Willis Towers Watson deal suggests transformative acquisitions might be off the table.","Aon is a leading global provider of insurance and reinsurance brokerage and human resource solutions. Its operations are tilted toward its brokerage operations. Headquartered in London, Aon has about 50,000 employees and operations in over 120 countries around the world.","We believe Aons capital structure is appropriate, given its level of business risk. Aon has increased leverage a bit over the past few years to finance a relatively high level of stock repurchases, and debt/EBITDA was 2.7 times at the end of 2022. Barring any major acquisition activity, the company has significant capital structure flexibility given its ample and fairly steady free cash flow, and we would expect leverage to stay in the 2-3 times range for the foreseeable future. However, we would not view a move to leverage above that level favorably.",AON,Financial Services,65424580608.0,NYQ,850792.0,USD,328.9800109863281,True,0,325.1978199678318,309.7508808654,0
24/11/2023,Higher Mortgage Rates Will Remain a Major Headwind for Rocket in 2023,Rocket Companies Inc,RKT,4,03/11/2023,Michael Miller,8.93,USD,23/11/2023,13.0,Very High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,03/11/2023,"Narrow-moat-rated Rocket Companies reported decent third-quarter earnings that were in line with our expectations as the company continues to be affected by weak mortgage conditions industrywide. Adjusted net revenue increased 12.8% from last year but was effectively flat sequentially at $1 billion. The company continues to benefit from its cost-cutting efforts, with the company flipping to an adjusted net gain of $7 million from a loss of $166 million last year. As we incorporate these results, we do not expect to materially alter our $13 per share fair value estimate. We see the shares as undervalued on a full-cycle basis, but near-term results will remain weak until mortgage rates fall, given that Rocket is so highly leveraged to the mortgage cycle. Mortgage origination volume, the largest driver of Rockets business, fell 13.2% from last year but was effectively flat from last quarter at $22.2 billion. High mortgage rates in the U.S. have caused mortgage refinance activity, historically Rockets strong point, to collapse and have placed major pressure on purchase volumes. While we expect conditions to improve eventually for Rocket, mortgage origination is an inherently cyclical business and until mortgage rates normalize major headwinds will remain for the company. On a more positive note, Rockets average gain on sale margin improved for the third time in a row, rising to 2.76% from 2.69% last year and 2.67% last quarter. While the firm is still being hurt by difficult industry conditions, it does appear that the worst of the margin pressure is behind us as capacity in the industry decreases. Additionally, while revenue has declined dramatically from its peak, Rocket remains in a healthy financial position because of significant cost-cutting and a strong balance sheet. Operating expenses declined 8.7% from last year to $1.09 billion. The firm now expects annualized cost reductions to come in at the high end of its original $150 million to $200 million range.","Rocket's scale and financial resources leaves its well equipped to weather the difficult operating climate facing mortgage lenders. Rocket has been able to significantly reduce its operating costs in recent quarters, helping mitigate the damage from falling revenue in a weak mortgage market. Rocket has been able to sign major partnerships to expand its partner network. Deals with Morgan Stanley and Intuits Mint represent major wins for the company. ","Mortgage origination remains highly volatile. Rockets results can vary substantially from year to year based on macroeconomic factors outside of its control. Rocket's strength in refinance activity has become a weakness for the firm, as its market share has fallen in the face of higher interest rates. Rockets revenue per mortgage has fallen alongside its mortgage origination volume, leading to a severe decline in revenue from the highs of 2020 and 2021.",23/08/2023,"While Rocket Companies offers a variety of products and services, the firm is best known for its Rocket Mortgage segment, which provides Rocket with most of its revenue. The mortgage industry is fractured and highly competitive, but Rocket has distinguished itself by operating as an entirely digital lender, originating and servicing its mortgages through its mobile app and website. Rocket has made substantial investments in automating the mortgage process and has been an industry leader in increasing loan processing speed and removing pain points for consumers. These investments, along with its control over the appraisal and titling process through its ownership of Amrock, have allowed the firm to offer an industry-leading mortgage experience to borrowers while also enjoying a cost structure advantage over its competitors. As a digital lender Rocket is able to scale its capacity for mortgage volume up or down quickly since each loan requires less manual attention. This flexibility will be needed as rising mortgage rates have pushed mortgage origination volume far below their 2020 and 2021 highs. Rocket is particularly exposed as it is strongest in mortgage refinance and price-sensitive first-time homebuyers, and the firm's origination volume has fallen more than the industrywide average as a result. As origination activity has been curtailed by higher interest rates, Rockets revenue and earnings have fallen sharply, and the company has had to reduce costs to roughly break even.  That said, through the full cycle we expect that Rocket will continue to gain market share from other lenders. Consumers have become more comfortable with conducting their finances digitally during the pandemic, and digital lenders, like Rocket, have benefited from this tailwind. Rocket has had strong success in expanding its partner network. While Rockets revenue and earnings will likely remain volatile, a symptom of the cyclical nature of the mortgage industry and its strength in mortgage refinance, the companys strong competitive position and trends in consumer behavior will provide it with long-term secular growth. ","In our view, Rocket Companies has established a clear competitive advantage in its core mortgage lending operations that should allow it to continue to increase its market share while still maintaining its strong margins and returns on invested capital. Rocket benefits from being a completely digital mortgage originator, which allows it to rapidly increase or decrease its lending capacity with less impact on its margins while also providing its users with an industry-leading consumer experience. In order to support this quality consumer experience, Rocket maintains more control over the mortgage process than many of its competitors by providing appraisal, titling, and closing services through its Amrock subsidiary and retaining the servicing rights of the loans it makes. A smooth process, both before and after a loan has been made, has allowed Rocket to develop a strong brand reputation that it monetizes through repeat business and its partner network. Rockets mortgage model facilitates and benefits from the companys increasing scale as it continues to gain market share in the mortgage industry. At a basic level, Rocket differentiates itself by originating and servicing its mortgages entirely through its mobile app and website. In its direct-to-consumer mortgage lending segment, users access Rockets platform themselves and navigate the process electronically. Rocket has made substantial investments in automating the mortgage process and has been an industry leader in increasing its speed and removing pain points. Innovations like allowing prospective borrowers to provide their bank login information to allow Rocket to verify income through transaction data creates less work for the borrower while also reducing Rockets origination costs. A fully digital model also has the benefit of making Rocket less labor intensive than its competitors since there are fewer manual touchpoints in the loan process. The company trains its employees to specialize in a single step of the mortgage process instead of using generalist loan officers who are responsible for a docket of loans, creating an assembly line approach to mortgages. This model gives Rocket more flexibility to scale its loan capacity up or down since it requires fewer employees who typically require less training then their competitors. Demand for mortgages can vary widely from year to year or even quarter to quarter based on interest rates or the health of the economy. The ability to scale capacity up or down with less need to change labor levels allows Rocket to take advantage of spikes in volume and maintain better margins during slow periods. This provides Rocket with a cost structure advantage over its competitors as a direct result of its operating model. This advantage is not counteracted by the cost of funding disadvantage Rocket has against its traditional banking rivals, as it resells the mortgages it makes to Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie Mae within days of making them, keeping the companys funding needs low relative to its size. Rocket also retains the mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the mortgages it makes and acts as a servicer as a core part of its business strategy. Keeping the servicing rights from its mortgages serves multiple strategic purposes, the most straightforward of which is that Rocket simply generates more revenue per mortgage. MSRs allow the servicing firm to keep a portion of the interest a mortgage borrower pays in exchange for servicing the underlying loan. When MSRs are sold the acquiring firm generates a return by offering less than the expected net present value of those interest payments. By not selling its MSRs Rocket gets to keep their full value, at the cost of taking on all responsibilities of a servicer. However, Rocket gains more from acting as a servicer than simply higher revenue per loan.Rockets choice to retain its servicing rights also allows it to maintain a high level of quality in the servicing of its mortgages since it retains control, unlike some of its competitors. This allows the company to ensure good servicing for its customers after a loan has been made. This same logic drives its appraisal and title insurance business, Amrock, which also serves to smooth out the consumer experience for its borrowers during the closing process while also generating additional revenue. By taking on a larger role over the life span of a loan, Rocket has been able to craft a mortgage experience that is more favorable to borrowers, creating a strong brand reputation in the process. Rocket has been ranked first in customer satisfaction for mortgage origination by JD Power 11 times in a row and first for mortgage servicing seven times in a row. A strong reputation remains a key part of Rockets model as its direct-to-consumer lending operation, which was 85% of its 2022 adjusted revenue, relies on potential buyers accessing its website or mobile app on their own. Retaining servicing rights also helps drive incremental business for Rocket. Rocket mortgage holders can use the mobile app to pay their bills, see home valuation estimates, and check rates. This creates constant touchpoints between Rocket and existing mortgage borrowers so when a current customer decides to refinance their mortgage or purchase a new home Rocket is at the top of their mind. Most mortgage borrowers only compare a handful of firms, and the constant contact between Rocket and its existing borrowers gives it a key advantage in generating repeat business. The mobile app also gives Rocket the ability to proactively market to existing customers based on movements in interest rates or home prices. Rocket has become increasingly adept at generating repeat business, giving it an advantage over its competitors. This can be seen in Rockets mortgage recapture rates, which have risen to 70%-80% in recent years, well above the companys peers. High mortgage recapture rates are a key part of Rockets overarching strategy as refinance or second purchase mortgages from existing Rocket customers come with much lower cost of acquisition as these borrowers can be marketed to natively within Rockets website or mobile app. At the end of June 2023, Rocket was the servicer for more than 2.4 million loans with a total unpaid balance over $500 billion, giving the company a large pool of potential repeat customers to build off. The value of Rockets existing user base has increased rapidly as the firm has taken market share, rising from 5% of total origination in 2018 to 8.4% in 2020. Cross-selling and repeat business are a key feature of Rockets overall strategy. While its servicing business and Amrock are its largest sources of revenue outside of mortgage origination, Rocket also offers a variety of services to consumers. Rockets personal loans and auto listing segments are only tangentially related to its core business but can serve to pull new users onto Rockets platform. Beyond driving higher mortgage recapture rates from happy borrowers, the quality of Rockets mortgage and servicing process and the strength of its name brand also help drive higher loan volumes through its partner network. In order to generate additional revenue, Rocket partners with mortgage brokers and larger firms like Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab to originate and service mortgages for their customers in exchange for a portion of the return from these loans. These mortgages are branded as being offered through Rocket, highlighting the strength of the brand, and have come to make up an increasingly large portion of Rockets total mortgage volume. Rockets ability to increase its market share and maintain its margins is the result of the cost efficiencies and scalability of its digital-only model, its strong reputation among mortgage borrowers, and its scale, which enables it to take its broad scope. Heavy investments in automation allow for more seamless information gathering during the origination process, and Rockets ownership of Amrock and its activities as a servicer help ensure a positive experience for its customers, which in turn drives its industry-leading retention ratios, allowing Rocket to generate more lifetime revenue from a single customer than its competitors. Recently, Rocket has had increasing success in offering its digital origination model to other firms and outside brokers as they find it easier to join Rocket than to compete against it. As a result, in our view Rocket has achieved a narrow moat rating from its intangible assets and cost advantages. ","We give Rocket a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. While Rocket has multiple lines of business, the majority of its revenue comes from either its mortgage origination business or its title insurance and appraisal subsidiary, Amrock. As a result, Rockets results are heavily influenced by mortgage volumes industrywide that can vary widely from year to year or even quarter to quarter based on interest rates or the economic cycle. Rocket is also particularly strong in mortgage refinance, the most volatile and interest rate-driven segment of the mortgage industry, which further increases the cyclicality of the firm's results. In the second quarter of 2023, Rocket's mortgage volume declined more than 35% from the prior-year period, which was down another 59% from the year before that. This volatility is further compounded by Rockets reliance on capital markets to finance the loans it makes and to purchase the mortgage-backed securitizations that are created with Rockets mortgages. Rocket does not hold a portfolio of mortgages on its balance sheet, instead, it prefers to sell them to either Fannie, Freddie, or Ginnie Mae as soon as possible. The prices Rocket receives for these loans depends on market conditions, and its revenue generated per loan can vary based on the demand for mortgage securitizations relative to supply. With both its sales volume and revenue per loan so heavily influenced by external factors, Rockets exposure to macroeconomic risk is substantial. This risk is only partially mitigated by Rockets strong financial position. Rocket does have some ESG risk, which is included in our high risk and uncertainty rating. There is inherit ESG risk to mortgages and mortgage servicing. There is potential for predatory or unfair lending practices that could negatively impact the companys reputation if discovered. Rocket also uses a dual share class structure to maintain the majority shareholder's control over the company, creating governance risk.","We give Rocket an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on its strong balance sheet, good investment history, and appropriate distribution policies. Rocket is exposed to both the cyclical nature of the mortgage industry and volatile pricing in mortgage secondary markets. As a result, its revenue and earnings can fluctuate substantially from year to year or even quarter to quarter, making a strong balance sheet a necessity for Rocket to operate safely. Fortunately, Rocket meets this need with low levels of corporate debt and good liquidity reserves. Rocket has nearly $900 million in cash, providing it with ample liquidity to meet short-term funding needs. Additionally, the firm holds over $6.4 billion in mortgage servicing assets held against just over $4 billion in debt not directly tied to its mortgage holdings, leaving the firm with significant financial reserves. Rockets success comes from the steady and consistent investments the company has made into its technology and consumer facing platform. Since becoming a purely digital lender in 2015, the company has developed a differentiated approach to mortgages that has allowed it to rapidly take market share while simultaneously enjoying a superior cost structure to its competitors. Without making the necessary investments in its technology, Rocket would not have found the success that it has. Rocket does make acquisitions, most notably its 2019 and 2020 acquisitions of Lendesk and Finmo to accelerate its Canadian expansion plans, but the majority of its investment spending has been on internal development. The companys expansions into home listings and home solar power financing will likely not be major drivers of revenue growth, but they do make strategic sense when viewed in the context of Rockets overall business.Considering the cyclicality and volatility of Rockets business along with its rapid growth, it makes sense that the company does not pay a dividend. That said, Rocket has shown willingness to return value to shareholders when it is appropriate to do so. In the first quarter of 2021 the company made a $2.2 billion special dividend payment to shareholders, returning some of the excess equity that had built up during a very strong 2020 fiscal year. The company has since followed that up with an additional $2 billion special dividend paid in 2022. Given the nature of Rockets industry, the use of special dividends instead of regular payments is reasonable as it will allow the company to return value to shareholders when it can but does not place its balance sheet at risk. Rocket is majority owned by founder and chairman Dan Gilbert, who controls more than 90% of the economic interest of Rocket. The company also uses a dual share class structure to give additional votes to the class D shares that Dan Gilbert had, so he will remain in effective control of the company for the foreseeable future. While there are certainly positive elements to having a well-motivated founder with a long-term interest in the companys future, there is an inherent agency risk to this ownership structure as the interests of the majority owner and the common shareholders may not always be in alignment. That said, Rocket has not taken any action that could be seen as detrimental to common shareholders. ","Rocket Companies is a financial services company that was originally founded as Rock Financial in 1985 and is currently based in Detroit. Rocket Companies offers a wide array of services and products but is best known for its Rocket Mortgage business. The companys mortgage lending operations are split between its direct-to-consumer lending, which sees borrowers accessing the companys lending arm directly through either its mobile app or website, and its partner network where mortgage brokers and other firms use Rockets origination process to offer loans to their customers. The company has rapidly gained market share in recent years and is now the largest mortgage originator in the U.S. as well as the servicer for more than 2 million loans. ","Rocket operates in a highly cyclical industry, as a result its revenue and earnings have the potential to drop sharply due to economic factors completely out of its control. While Rocket does resell the mortgages it makes within days of origination, the sheer volume of mortgages that Rocket creates means that the company has billions in mortgage debt on its balance sheet at any given point in time. At the end of June 2023, Rocket had more than $8.4 billion in mortgages, which were financed by equity and less than $5 billion in funding facilities. The combination of volatile revenue and substantial funding needs means that Rockets financial strength is an important factor to watch, particularly during slower markets. Despite this, we do not have any significant concerns about Rockets financial health at this time. The company has a strong balance sheet and has been able to maintain constant profitability, even during slow periods for mortgage origination. Rocket had nearly $900 million in cash at the end of June 2023 and just over $4 billion in debt not directly tied to its mortgage holdings. With an additional $6.4 billion worth of mortgage servicing rights, Rocket should have more than enough financial resources to see it through the current mortgage market downturn.",RKT,Financial Services,19614650368.0,NYQ,2837306.0,USD,8.930000305175781,True,1,9.19776472203647,12.161111113462963,1
25/11/2023,Novartis' Branded Drug Business Remains Well Positioned Following Sandoz Spinoff,Novartis AG,NOVN,3,24/10/2023,Damien Conover,86.79,CHF,24/11/2023,85.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,24/10/2023,"Novartis posted third-quarter earnings largely in line with our expectations and we are not making any changes to the firms fair value estimate of CHF 85. At the current stock price, we believe the market is appropriately viewing the firms growth potential with a mix of major patent losses, offset by a strong innovative pipeline that supports the firms wide moat. In the quarter, Novartis posted 12% operational growth, but we expect this growth to decelerate over the next three years as patent pressures increase. Cardiovascular drug Entresto (up 31%) represents the firms largest drug and should continue to post gains until the patent losses occur most likely in 2026 for key markets. The firms second-largest product, immunology drug Cosentyx, grew 4% as the market gets saturated and stronger competition limits the drugs potential. Multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta has already grown into the firms third-largest drug and posted 86% normalized growth. With shared leading efficacy with Roches Ocrevus, we expect both drugs to continue to post robust growth as they control less than half of the market. Additionally, breast cancer drug Kisqali (up 76%) is finally making significant progress in the metastatic setting with leading overall survival data. Kisqalis likely addition of the adjuvant indication in 2024 should further propel growth. Offsetting the robust quarterly growth, patent pressures from multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, cancer drug Tasigna, and acromegaly drug Sandostatin will likely weigh on growth over the next two years. Novartis is making progress in developing the next generation of drugs to propel long-term growth. Recently released Pluvicto data in second-line prostate cancer suggests the drug holds potential of well over $2 billion annually. Also, rare-disease drug iptacopan posted favorable data in IgA nephropathy, setting up potential approval in one of several likely indications and supporting peak annual sales potential of over $2 billion.","Novartis' solid late-stage pipeline should propel long-term growth. The company should launch several new drugs during the next several years in critical therapeutic areas such as rare diseases and oncology. Novartis recently divested its Roche share, yielding over $20 billion, which provides the firm with increased options to re-deploy capital including share buybacks. Novartis' research and development focuses on areas of unmet medical need, which should yield several innovative therapies with strong pricing power.","The patent loss on multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya creates a significant drag on sales in 2023-24 as generic competition increases. Novartis is facing a large patent cliff starting in 2026, which may set up challenges to longer-term growth.  Novartis is well behind competition in immuno-oncology, which may hurt its overall cancer presence given the transformative advancements within immuno-oncology.",04/10/2023,"With strong positions in multiple key therapeutic areas, Novartis is well positioned for steady long-term cash flows. Strong intellectual property supporting multibillion-dollar products, combined with an abundance of late-pipeline products, creates a wide economic moat. While patent losses on multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya and cancer drug Afinitor will weigh on near-term growth, a strong portfolio of drugs along with a robust pipeline should ensure a steady long-term outlook. Novartis' drug segment is poised for steady cash flows driven by new pipeline products and existing drugs. Novartis' strategy to focus largely in areas of unmet medical need should strengthen the firm's pricing power. The firm's key areas of innovation focus on oncology, immunology, neurology, and rare diseases. Additionally, Novartis differentiates itself by its sheer number of blockbusters, including Entresto for heart failure and Cosentyx for immunology diseases. Also, it has generated a strong late-stage pipeline with recent launches of multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta and cancer drug Kisqali. Within the pipeline, rare disease drug iptacopan looks like the strongest late-stage drug, with peak annual sales potential of over $2 billion. Despite the patent losses on Gilenya and Afinitor, the combination of a strong pipeline of new products and a diverse, well-positioned operating platform should translate into steady cash flows. Novartis spun off its generic drug unit Sandoz in October 2023 to gain more focus on the branded drug business. While the generics unit offers some synergies with the branded drug business, we have viewed the overlaps as relatively minor. As a result, we don't expect many dissynergies by spinning off the Sandoz business. The spinoff is in line with Novartis' strategy to focus on human prescription drugs, which has been playing out over the past several years with the divestitures of the eye care (Alcon), vaccine, animal health, and consumer healthcare businesses. ","Patents, economies of scale, and a powerful distribution network support Novartis wide moat. Novartis patent-protected drugs carry strong pricing power, which enables the firm to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital. Further, the patents give the company time to develop the next generation of drugs before generic competition arises. While Novartis holds a diversified product portfolio, there is some product concentration with its largest drugs, Entresto (close to 15% of sales) and Cosentyx (close to 10% of sales). Both drugs will likely face generic pressures starting in 2026 in some countries. However, we expect new products will mitigate the generic competition. Novartis operating structure allows for cost-cutting following patent losses to reduce the margin pressure from lost high-margin drug sales. Overall, Novartis established product line creates the enormous cash flows needed to fund the average $800 million in development costs per new drug. In addition, the company's powerful distribution network sets up the company as a strong partner for smaller drug companies that lack Novartis resources. We think the firm does face environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks, particularly related to potential U.S. drug price-related policy reform (close to one third of total sales are generated by prescription branded drugs sales in the U.S.) to increase access by lowering drug prices. Ongoing product governance issues (including litigation related to side effects and patents) also weigh on the company. While we have factored these threats into our analysis, we don't see them as material to our moat rating.","Novartis, like all branded pharmaceutical firms, faces a number of considerable threats, including drug trial failures, extended new drug approval times, pricing pressure from the managed-care industry, and political pressure to rein in the costs of drugs. Also, increasingly aggressive generic drug companies are attacking patents on branded drugs several years before key expiration dates. Further, following several acquisitions and divestitures, the company faces integration risks in bringing together all of the segment lines while staying focused on key strategies. However, our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is Medium given the high level of diversity within the firm's broad drug portfolio. The Medium uncertainty is an increase following the divestments of several business units (most recently the Sandoz generic business), leaving the firm less diversified versus the company's conglomerate structure.Our uncertainty rating for the company is not materially affected by environmental, social, and governance risks, although we see access to basic services (tied to drug pricing) as the biggest ESG risk that the firm needs to manage. Novartis generates close to one third of total sales from U.S. branded prescription drug sales (lower relative to peers) so additional major pricing reforms could weigh on sales and margins.Additionally, we assume a more than 50% probability of Novartis seeing future costs related to product governance ESG risks (such as off-label marketing or litigation related to side effects) and model base case annual legal costs at 1% of non-GAAP net income (lower relative to peers based on Novartis product portfolio having less exposure to future potential litigation). ","Overall, we rate Novartis capital allocation as Standard. The rating reflects our belief that Novartis possesses a sound balance sheet, a reasonable track record of investments, and largely fair shareholder distributions.We believe Novartis holds a sound balance sheet with low levels of risk regarding: 1) size of the debt carried; 2) the business cyclicality facing the firm; and 3) the debt maturity outlook. While an argument could be made to increase the leverage of the balance sheet to be more active in investing, we believe the company along with the majority of firms in the large cap biopharma industry should hold ample balance sheet strength to support opportunistic acquisitions as dynamic scientific data emerges that might require relatively investment quick action. Also, a strong balance sheet helps biopharma firms through most product litigation challenges with minimal concern by the market. Turning to investments, we believe Novartis is operating at a reasonable level. The company tends to spend on R&D at a high teens level of sales (in line with the industry average). The solid investments in creating the next generation of drugs has yielded a strong pipeline of drugs supporting next generation of drugs to offset patent losses. The strong investment in innovative new drugs (largely targeting areas of oncology and immunology) also helps fortify the firms wide moat and expand the returns on invested capital.On the acquisition and partnership side, Novartis has made several strong strategic acquisitions over the recent past, but some of the purchase prices bordered on the high end of the valuation range. The smart acquisition of rare-disease company AveXis for $8.7 billion yielded gene therapy drug Zolgensma that should have annualized sales above $2 billion. The 2014 decisions to sell the animal health and vaccine businesses appear to be sound strategic moves as the company lacked the needed scale in these areas. Also, the sale prices appear favorable. However, in tandem with these sales, the company paid $16 billion (10 times sales) for Glaxo's oncology business, which seems to have overvalued the cancer assets. The recent decisions to spin off the Alcon (ophthalmology business) and Sandoz (generic drugs) units make strategic sense, as the divisions lack many synergies with the drug business.Regarding distributions, we view Novartis dividends and share repurchases as about right. Novartis has generally targeted close to a 50% payout in dividends as a percentage of normalized earnings, which seems about right for a more mature industry. Further, Novartis has shown a willingness to buy back shares at generally neutral time periods. Turning to management specifically, Vasant Narasimhan replaced eight-year veteran Joe Jimenez as CEO in early 2018. Narasimhan brings a strong background that fits well with Novartis' operations. Early in his career, he worked at McKinsey before joining Novartis in 2005. Narasimhan's experience in leading the drug development division and the Sandoz biopharmaceutical unit as well as leadership in the important oncology drug development group should help him effectively lead the company. In 2013, Harry Kirsch took over as CFO, replacing industry veteran Jon Symonds. A key focus for Kirsch is improving operating margins, which have been helped by the divestment of several lower-margin business units.","Novartis develops and manufactures innovative drugs. The firm's key areas of drug development include oncology, rare diseases, neuroscience, immunology, respiratory, cardio-metabolic, and established medicines. The company sells its products globally, with the United States representing close to one third of total revenue.","Novartis carries a solid financial position with debt/2023 projected EBITDA of 1.4 times. Further, its diverse portfolio of drugs should translate into steady cash flows to easily service debt requirements. Novartis primarily uses its cash to fund its dividend, which represents close to 60% of the company's core earnings. We expect continued dividend increases but a slow rate over the next few years. Additionally, we expect the firm will continue to pursue acquisitions, which are likely to be funded by cash from operations and occasionally increased debt.",NOVN.SW,Healthcare,176420126720.0,EBS,357675.0,CHF,86.25,True,0,82.65497553625697,85.79655186723049,0
24/11/2023,PG&E Rate Case Provides Growth Pathway Through 2026,PG&E Corp,PCG,2,19/11/2023,Travis Miller,17.97,USD,23/11/2023,15.5,Medium,,Standard,B,19/11/2023,"We are raising our fair value estimate for PG&E to $15.50 per share from $15 after California regulators approved electric and gas rate increases in 2023-26 mostly in line with our estimate. We also increased our allowed return on equity for 2024 and 2025 to reflect likely adjustments based on higher interest rates. We are maintaining our no-moat rating. The long-delayed decision allows PG&E to increase revenue by $1.1 billion for 2023, in line with our estimate and 12% lower than PG&E's request. The decision allows a $703 million rate increase in 2024, a $302 million rate increase in 2025, and a $176 million rate increase in 2026. Our fair value estimate increase was due to a higher long-term growth rate and higher allowed ROE assumption. Our 2023 EPS estimate remains in line with management's $1.19-$1.23 guidance range, reflecting 10% year-over-year earnings growth. We assume 10% EPS growth in 2024, ramping down to 6% growth by 2028. We expect management to update its $40 billion 2023-26 investment plan and growth outlook, including 2024 earnings guidance, in the coming weeks. The only significant change we expect to PG&E's current capital investment plan is the pace of electric undergrounding. PG&E had proposed burying 2,000 miles in 2023-26 for $5.9 billion, but the decision allows only 1,230 miles of undergrounding for $4.7 billion. We now assume PG&E's 10,000-mile undergrounding investment stretches well into the next decade. The final decision puts pressure on management to contain operating costs to meet its growth targets. The decision only allowed half of PG&E's proposed cost escalation estimate. Any spending above the approved operating cost budget will reduce growth and shareholder returns. Despite a recent pullback in PG&E's stock price, it remains one of the few utilities trading above our fair value estimate. We continue to expect PG&E to initiate a dividend in 2024.","California's utility rate regulation is highly constructive with usage-decoupled revenue, annual rate true-up adjustments, and forward-looking rate setting. Regulators continue to support the company's investments in grid modernization, electric vehicles, and renewable energy to meet the state's progressive energy policies. State legislation passed in August 2018 and mid-2019 should help limit shareholder losses if PG&E faces another round of wildfire liabilities.",PG&E depends almost entirely on regulators to approve rate hikes to cover its large investment plan. A cut in regulated rates couldjeopardize earnings growth. PG&E will likely pay only a small dividend in 2024 and 2025 to conserve capital for growth investments. Future safety lapses almost certainly will lead to a state takeover with another round of large losses for shareholders.,19/11/2023,"PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in July 2020 after 17 months of negotiating with 2017-18 Northern California fire victims, insurance companies, politicians, lawyers, and bondholders. Shareholders lost some $30 billion in settlements, fines, and costs, but PG&E exited with bondholders made whole and shareholders still in control. The new PG&E is well positioned for growth, given the infrastructure investment necessary to meet California's aggressive energy and environmental policies. We expect PG&E to invest more than $8 billion annually for the next five years, leading to 9% annual growth. We also expect PG&E will be positioned to pay a dividend in 2024 for the first time since late 2017 based on the bankruptcy exit plan terms. California's utility ratemaking regulation is highly constructive with usage-decoupled rates, four-year rate reviews, and allowed returns above the industry average. The 2023-26 general rate case ended with what we consider a constructive outcome that supports PG&E's investments in clean energy and safety. California aims to eliminate all carbon emissions from its economy by 2045. This upside is partially offset by the uncertain future of PG&E's natural gas business, which will likely shrink as California decarbonizes its economy. PG&E will always face public and regulatory scrutiny as the largest utility in California. Deadly wildfires and power outages have escalated that scrutiny. Legislative and regulatory changes during and since PG&E's bankruptcy have reduced the company's financial risk, but the state's inverse condemnation strict liability standard remains a concern. CEO Patti Poppe has a tall task mending PG&E's relationships with customers, regulators, politicians, and investors. The $59 billion bankruptcy was PG&E's second in 20 years. The 2020 bankruptcy exit terms all but guarantee a state takeover if PG&E has any safety or operational missteps. PG&E is still under court and regulatory supervision following the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion. We estimate fines and penalties from the San Bruno disaster and allegations of poor recordkeeping resulted in $3 billion of lost shareholder value.","We do not believe PG&E has an economic moat. Although regulated utilities' service territory monopolies and efficient scale dynamics remain, we do not have enough confidence that PG&E will maintain a sufficiently wide spread between its cost of capital and returns on capital for more than 10 years to justify a narrow moat rating.Wildfire safety expenses, postbankruptcy regulatory restrictions, and unrecovered investments likely will depress returns on capital for many years. PG&E is often subject to more regulatory scrutiny than most other utilities, and we expect that to continue following bankruptcy. State legislation in 2019 reduced the financial risk for a utility if its equipment starts a wildfire. But the state's inverse condemnation standard remains in place, exposing utilities to potential disaster liabilities. In December 2017, California regulators denied San Diego Gas and Electric recovery of wildfire costs, setting the precedent that led PG&E into bankruptcy in January 2019. SDG&E appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the court declined to review it in October 2019. Reforms to the inverse condemnation standard will take new legislation in California. That doesn't seem likely anytime soon.California's core ratemaking regulation is highly constructive, including allowed returns on equity that are above the sector average, usage-decoupled rates, and multiyear capital investment budgets. This constructive regulation typically would support an economic moat for a regulated utility, like its state peers Edison International and Sempra Energy. But the San Bruno pipeline explosion in September 2010, allegations of gas pipeline mismanagement, and 2017-18 wildfire liabilities have sunk PG&E's earned returns on capital.The San Bruno incident resulted in $1.6 billion of penalties in addition for $558 million of third-party claims. Wildfire victims and insurers received $25.5 billion out of PG&E's bankruptcy and shareholders suffered several billion dollars in additional fines and unrecovered costs.Regulators will have to tread lightly if they want PG&E to be able to raise the capital required to decarbonize the state's economy. PG&E's last three major rate cases, including the recently concluded 2023-26 case, have ended with constructive outcomes that supported most of PG&E's proposed capital investments. Regulators have focused more on ensuring PG&E is being efficient with its operating costs to limit customer bill increases.PG&E hasn't always achieved constructive regulatory outcomes. PG&E for many years struggled with California regulators. The California Public Utilities Commission granted PG&E just 55% of its requested revenue increase in its 2014-16 general rate case and just half of its requested rate increases in its 2011-13 general rate case. We need more proof that PG&E can maintain regulatory and political goodwill before considering a narrow moat rating.","We give PG&E a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating based on its higher operational and financial risk than most U.S. utilities. PG&E faces ongoing scrutiny from regulators, customers, and politicians. New management since 2021 has reduced some of that risk with improved operational performance and constructive regulatory outcomes.Wildfire safety remains a top concern. Regulators have designated half of PG&E service territory as elevated or extreme fire danger areas. California legislation in 2019 reduced PG&E's financial risk. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund covers fire liabilities over $1 billion and caps PG&E's total liabilities at $3 billion. Regulators have approved PG&E's plan to carry $1 billion of annual fire insurance and have supported large safety investments. Still, PG&E faces another round of shareholder losses if there is a safety lapse.PG&E's inability to access capital markets at reasonable prices due to wildfire-related liabilities led to the bankruptcy in January 2019. Shareholders ultimately lost nearly $30 billion of value.Before the fires, PG&E had put aside nearly all of its financial uncertainty related to gas pipeline penalties and was headed into 2018-19 with more strategic and financial clarity than it had in many years following several key regulatory decisions.PG&E needs well-functioning and cost-effective capital markets to fund its huge capital investment plan. California's quest to eliminate carbon emissions means utilities face significant public policy pressure to invest in energy infrastructure that supports distributed generation, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. This makes it critical that PG&E works closely with policymakers and regulators to ensure it has financial support for these investments.California's inverse condemnation strict liability standard will continue to be a legal and financial risk for utilities until politicians take action. We think this is unlikely in the near term, given public animosity toward PG&E.","We assign PG&E a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on management's work since 2021 to improve relationships with many stakeholders and pursue value-accretive investments that reduce the risk of power outages and fires. PG&E management has many constituencies to please and little room for missteps. California's public policies addressing renewable energy, grid modernization, electric vehicles, safety, and reliability offer huge growth opportunities. However, management must maintain good regulatory relationships and execute the investment plan to realize the upside.CEO Patti Poppe took over in January 2021 after leading CMS Energy in Michigan. Poppe was PG&E's third permanent CEO since 2016, replacing Bill Johnson, who resigned after only 14 months on the job. Poppe has done a good job early in her tenure resetting relationships with many stakeholders. Her focus on safety and operating efficiency is resonating with regulators. Her next big test is executing the 2023-26 general rate case plan approved in late 2023.The threat of a state takeover will linger for many years. Regulators will scrutinize reliability issues, including power shutoffs to avoid sparking wildfires. Environmentalists want to ensure PG&E can hit its renewable energy and carbon-reduction targets. Politicians are unlikely to change the state's inverse condemnation doctrine, so management will have to continue managing the risk of large liabilities if PG&E's equipment is involved in a wildfire.The bankruptcy exit plan required PG&E to add several new safety-related management roles and an independent safety monitor who can recommend a state takeover if PG&E has any safety lapses. In June 2020, PG&E expanded its board to 14 directors, seven of whom are from California. Only three remain from the board that guided PG&E through bankruptcy.CFO Carolyn Burke came to PG&E from Chevron in 2023 and has extensive management experience in the utilities sector. She is PG&E's third CFO since the bankruptcy. Her predecessors, Chris Foster and Jason Wells, both left for CenterPoint Energy.Johnson and Wells deserve credit for preserving as much shareholder value as possible during the bankruptcy. They fended off a state takeover attempt, reached settlements that limited shareholder losses, avoided lengthy litigation with fire victims, and achieved constructive wildfire legislation in 2018 and 2019. Their success reduces the risk that PG&E will face bankruptcy during every bad fire season.The 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion also resulted in substantial financial losses from fines and penalties along with a new outsider CEO, Tony Earley. By late 2016, PG&E had recovered financially from that incident, re-established good relationships with regulators, politicians, customers, and investors, and transitioned leadership to insider CEO Geisha Williams when the 2017 wildfires broke out. Williams held the top spot for less than two years before resigning in early 2019 ahead of the bankruptcy.PG&E has several large stockholders that bought during the bankruptcy. PG&E was the largest stock holding for deep-value hedge fund Third Point at year-end 2022, according to regulatory filings.","PG&E is a holding company whose main subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric, a regulated utility operating in Central and Northern California that serves 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties. PG&E operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020. In 2004, PG&E sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier postbankruptcy reorganization.","PG&E exited bankruptcy with a capital structure mostly in line with its regulatory allowed capital structure. Many of the same bondholders hold PG&E's $38 billion of new or reinstated debt. PG&E will use securitized debt to eliminate $6 billion of temporary debt at the utility and further fortify its balance sheet.We expect PG&E to maintain investment-grade credit ratings with EBITDA/interest coverage near 5 times. State legislation in 2019 will help mitigate some of PG&E's fire-related risks and support investment-grade credit ratings.The bankruptcy primarily changed the equity ownership mix. PG&E raised $5.8 billion of new common stock and equity units in June 2020, representing about 30% ownership. Several large investment firms contributed another $3.25 billion of new equity. Legacy shareholders retained about 26% ownership at the bankruptcy exit.The fire victims trust received 477 million shares, representing 24% ownership. It had sold all but 68 million shares as of August 2023 at a weighted-average $14.66 per share. It now owns about 3% of the company.We estimate PG&E will invest $9 billion annually on average during the next few years. Tax benefits and regulatory asset recovery should result in minimal new equity and debt needs at least through 2024.PG&E entered bankruptcy after a sharp stock price drop in late 2018 made it prohibitively expensive to maintain its 52% required equity capitalization. Bankruptcy settlements with fire victims, insurance companies, and municipalities totaled $25.5 billion, of which about $19 billion was paid in cash upon exit.We expect PG&E will reinitiate a dividend in 2024 after meeting the terms of its bankruptcy settlement. Before PG&E cut its dividend in late 2017, we anticipated 6% annual dividend growth, in line with earnings growth. PG&E went six years without a dividend increase following the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline incident.",PCG,Utilities,44384251904.0,NYQ,19726565.0,USD,17.969999313354492,True,0,16.716744692182356,17.024532153282713,0
24/11/2023,Netwealth Results In Line With Our Thesis for Increasing Wealth Platform Competition,Netwealth Group Ltd,NWL,2,03/11/2023,Shaun Ler,14.21,AUD,24/11/2023,10.1,High,,Standard,,03/11/2023,"Our conviction in the thesis for listed wealth managers, asset managers, and their related service providers has strengthened after gathering insights from the recent 2023 Super & Wealth Summit, hosted by the Australian Financial Review. These firms are influenced by similar business drivers and industry trends. Most derive their revenue from funds under management and/or administration, or FUMA, which are driven by asset price movements and new fund flows from clients, and management fees or commissions on these FUMA. Most asset managers and related firms under our coverage are undervalued, with an average discount of 21%. Investors are overly fixated on headwinds that are mainly cyclical while underestimating the potential for improved earnings as business conditions normalize. Fee compression will persist as firms strive to remain competitive when faced with larger rivals like industry super funds that are growing in size through mandated super contributions. We also see ongoing cost-outs as firms keep pace with competition and retain client assets. We also think firms with a diverse product portfolio have a relatively greater ability to attract and retain client assets. We retain our fair value estimates for wealth management providers AMP, Hub24, Insignia, and Netwealth at AUD 1.35, AUD 24.50, AUD 3.40, and AUD 10.10 per share, respectively. Likewise, our fair value estimates for asset managers Challenger, GQG, Magellan, Perpetual, Pinnacle, and Platinum remain at AUD 7.30, AUD 2.00, AUD 9.60, AUD 27.50, AUD 11.00, and AUD 1.90 per share. Lastly, we maintain our fair value estimates for related service providers Iress and Link at AUD 9.20 and AUD 1.50. Among these 12 firms, only Pinnacle, Perpetual, Iress, and Link have narrow economic moats, while the rest have no moat. We favor Insignia among the wealth management providers and prefer Pinnacle, Perpetual, and Challenger among the asset managers. Iress is our pick among the related service providers.","Netwealth has only a small percentage of the investment administration market, at around 7%, but has won market share quickly. Significant growth potential remains. Netwealth will remain a strong player in the platforms market. It has an untarnished name, does not have the bureaucracy of larger firms and its strategy is centred on increasing customer stickiness. Netwealth has a low fixed-cost base which means operating leverage is higher than typical industrial businesses. Its pristine financial health supports dividends notwithstanding its positive growth outlook. ","Netwealth operates in a commoditized industry and has less funds under administration than many of its competitors. We expect the larger administration platforms to continue improving the functionality of their platforms and compete more aggressively on price.  Unlike conventional software businesses that can exert pricing power on more dependent customers, Netwealth operates in a highly regulated industry that advocates for lower fees to consumers. As a pure-play software business, Netwealth lacks an aligned adviser network to direct fund flows to its platform. ",16/08/2023,"Netwealth provides investment administration software as a service. It includes portfolio administration, investment management tools, and investment and managed account services. The firms administrative capabilities encompass custodial and noncustodial assets. Netwealths product integrates with external software, allowing it to facilitate more functions and streamline the implementation of financial advice to clients under a singleits ownplatform. While Netwealth services all cohorts, it is particularly successful catering to more affluent clients who generate more revenue because of greater asset values and trading activity. This supports Netwealth's higher operating leverage relative to its peers. Netwealth has exploited the bureaucracy and lethargy of the small number of dominant wealth management firms in Australia to develop a superior product and service. This has driven the group's rapid FUA grow in recent years. Netwealth has benefited from the Future of Financial Advice reforms, which had protocols like bans on conflicted remunerations or duty for advisers to act in clients best interests. The 2018 Hayne Royal Commission was another material tailwind. These events encouraged advisers to break from vertically integrated wealth management businesses, and seek new fee sources, including managed accounts, which were mainly available on independent platforms like Netwealth's.  We expect future competition among platforms to be more even, rather than skewed in favor of specialty firms like Netwealth. We believe Netwealth will continue gaining share, albeit slower than historically. It will keep benefiting from the post-Royal Commission popularity of independent platforms, but this trend will likely subside over time. Across the industry, players have evolved to comply with regulatory reforms and improved their products.  Netwealth remains relatively subscale to incumbent platforms and regulatory oversight is tight. As such, we dont think the firm can win a price war, nor can it charge a premium for its services on a maintainable basis. Fee compression and continuing growth investments are likely to limit operating leverage.","We dont believe Netwealth has an economic moat, given the number of competing offerings with very similar functionality and the tendency for improvements in the group's software functionality to be replicated by competitors. Despite strong earnings growth and returns on invested capital, or ROIC, Netwealth operates in a commoditized industry. It competes with several other specialty platforms, including HUB24 and Praemium, in addition to major wealth management institutions such as AMP, Insignia and Macquarie. Platforms largely compete on functionality, customer service, and price. They rarely have exclusivity with their financial adviser customers, who on average uses two or three different platforms.Certain tailwinds behind the growth of specialty platformslike Netwealth'sare unlikely to last. While specialty platforms did gain share by virtue of their superior functionality and service, they were also buoyed by negative sentiment toward (and the move away from) incumbent wealth managers. This was started by the 2018 Hayne Royal Commission, which saw the incumbents lose market share due to reputational damage and regulatory reforms. Back then, incumbent platforms tended to be subpar in quality and costly. Regardless, there were advisers who exploited loopholes in existing compliance protocols and continued recommending incumbent platforms to clients.Sentiment can reverse and the laggards can catch up. The incumbents have since evolved to comply with industry reforms and improved their own products. While most remain in a period of transition, they are rapidly catching up on product features, and we're not confident Netwealth will maintain its technological edge over the next decade. Mergers and acquisitions, like IOOF buying MLC, have strengthened the incumbents' economies of scale. It provides room for one to rationalise systems, reduce variable costs, and lower product fees to attract fund flows. AMP, which used to only sell its platforms via its adviser network, is now also distributing through non-AMP advisers. Netwealth will unlikely win a price war given its lack of scale. It remains relatively subscale in the platforms market with about 7% market shareand thats after the post-Royal Commission popularity surge of specialty platforms (that we expect will not last). We also expect the major incumbents to rationalise their platform cost base to a level thats comparable with Netwealth. Netwealths market share was less than 2% prior to the 2018 Hayne Royal Commission. The incumbents, comprising AMP, Insignia, BT, Colonial First State and Macquarie continue to make up more than 75% of the market. Based on published rates, these incumbents charge less than Netwealth on several tiers (breadth of a platforms offering) and price points (a clients investable amount).We also dont see maintainable switching costs. Netwealth intends to further integrate itself into client processes, both from an operational (for example, consolidating client information into a single interface) and technological (for example, providing data analytics) perspective. The intention is to create friction if advisers and their clients want to switch away (as switching may bring operational risks). This is a common method that software businesses use to build switching costs. Most would subsequently charge customers higher fees as they become more dependent.But we dont think this approach can help Netwealth build a moat. This strategy is not only adopted by Netwealth, as HUB24with around 6% share of the platforms marketalso does the same. Also, there is no single value proposition that can satisfy all parties given varying client circumstances and adviser needs. Clients and advisers value additional factors like low fees or access to bespoke products/services, and not just the convenience of having an all in one product (that might not be in the clients best interests). This is why financial advisers, on average, use two or three different platforms. We note AMP and Insignia have progressively lowered fees and closed the gap with Netwealth on product features. These efforts helped them alleviate their rate of redemptions (while assisting new business wins) and keep up with competition. In addition, the administrative switching barrier may fall further as platform technology improves. For example, platforms are increasingly bearing the cost of transferring funds to their platform in order to attract funds under administration, or FUA. Many allow in-specie transfers, which is the process of transferring assets between entities without having to sell them down. Historically, switching platforms requires selling and repurchasing investments, which creates taxation issues or having to crystallise gains/losses. We dont think Netwealth has pricing power. Regulatory constraints will continue to drive down fees. The best interest duty obligations require advisers to recommend products that are in clients best interests. Price is often the main basis of recommendation, unless an adviser can justify a more expensive product that has better features. But any improvements in platform features tend to be replicated, resulting in competing offerings all having similar functionality. Product discounting is fairly common in this market, suggesting that price competition will likely persist. Indeed, all platform businesses, including Netwealth, have reported steady fee declines in recent years. Furthermore, platforms' revenue model of charging fees based on funds under administration is not maintainable, considering the platform costs are not linked to FUA.Netwealth generates very high return on invested capital, or ROIC, but this reflects the capital-light and service-focused nature of the business model. The company also expenses all its research and development costs meaning little capital value sits on the balance sheet. For example, as of June 30, 2023, Netwealth's total assets were valued at just AUD 162 million. The book value of equity was just AUD 123 million. This means ROIC is almost always likely to significantly exceed the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. But it also means the metric has little use as an indication of a moat as high ROIC is prevalent across the industry.","We assign Netwealth a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. The primary risks facing Netwealth include the loss of FUA from its platform and fee compression; both could have a significant impact on revenue. The company has quickly increased client numbers and FUA on its platform in recent years, but we believe this reflects a combination of the lethargy of the large financial service providers and a change in financial services regulation. In future, we expect the large investment administration platform providers to compete much more aggressively for FUA via a combination of improved functionality of their platforms and more competitive pricing. Its also possible that large overseas providers, such as Charles Schwab, could enter the market with a significantly disruptive business modelsuch as near-zero platform fees, as they operate in the U.S.which would have a significant impact on Netwealth. In addition to competitive threats to FUA pricing, Netwealths FUA is also exposed to financial market movements. Financial market weakness could trigger issues with investment products which could damage Netwealths reputation and cause a reduction in FUA.Netwealth could also face operational issues, in that a failure of its information technology systems could cause reputational damage and potential litigation. The financial services sector is also highly regulated and one in which regulators and the Federal government are keen to see that customers are treated fairly. This could result in regulatory changes which adversely affect Netwealth.Environmental social and governance, or ESG, risk facing Netwealth primarily relates to data privacy and security issues, but we consider this risk to be low. Product governance could also potentially be an issue, considering Netwealth provides investment products. However, as most revenue is generated from administrative software, we consider ESG risk on this front to be negligible.","We assign Netwealth a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This reflects our assessment of fair investment efficacy, a sound balance sheet, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Investment efficacy is fair. Although Netwealth has generated strong revenue and profit growth in recent years, which we expect to continue, we dont expect future investments to materially improve the companys competitive position or create an economic moat. We believe the post-Royal Commission popularity of specialty platforms (that propelled Netwealth's growth) will subside over time. A lack of scale relative to the incumbents means its unlikely Netwealth can keep attracting flows via low fees. Given a tight regulation framework that advocates for lower fees to the end consumer, we also dont think Netwealth can charge a premium for its products. Its ecosystem-building strategy, too, may see limited success. This model can be redundant if another competitor can offer similar features as Netwealth but at a lower price.The balance sheet is sound and will likely remain so. Netwealth does not require material fixed asset investment to operate its software-as-a-service business model. Rather, operating costs mainly comprise ongoing employee costs, relating to software maintenance and development, and other business administration costs. Although Netwealths software development activities create value for shareholders, the associated intangible assets are not reflected on the balance sheet in a material way because costs are usually expensed.Netwealths ability to use its cash flow to fund business expansion means the company has not needed to materially issue equity or debt, and has maintained a net cash position in recent years. We expect this situation to continue for the foreseeable future. The service nature, and very low capital intensity, of the company means that Netwealths underlying return on invested capital is very high but not a particularly useful financial metric to assess durable competitive advantage in the financial platform services industry. Netwealth is highly cash generative. Its therefore appropriate that Netwealth maintains a relatively high dividend payout ratio of between 70%-80% of its statutory net profit after tax.","Netwealth provides cloud-based investment administration software as a service, or SaaS, in Australia via its proprietary platform. Netwealths platform provides portfolio administration, investment management tools, and investment and managed account services to financial intermediaries and directly to clients. The company charges SaaS fees based on funds under administration and management on its platform. Netwealth also offers Netwealth-branded investment products on its platform which are managed by third-party investment managers. ","Netwealth is in good financial health thanks to its service-based and capital-light business model, which has little need for debt or equity capital. The lack of capital requirements means equity issuance is low and the balance sheet debt-free, a situation we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.

24/11/2023,2024 Begins the Next Phase in L3Harris' Emergence as a Prime Defense Contractor,L3Harris Technologies Inc,LHX,4,29/10/2023,Nicolas Owens,187.83,USD,23/11/2023,230.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,29/10/2023,"With L3Harris' third-quarter results in hand, we have raised our fair value estimate for the narrow-moat defense contractor by just over 1% to $230 to account for the time value of money. Year to date, the company reported steady growth across its segments, with segment operating margins over 14%, which bodes well for future quarters if the company can fulfill its multiple post-merger plans to increase margins further. The company is the result of a series of strategic mergers, like most of its larger ""prime"" defense contracting peers, but it is a bit earlier in its evolution by comparison. The company announced that 2024 would begin the next phase of its merger integration between L3 Technologies and Harris, itself consummated in 2019referring to this as the hard work beyond finding obvious cost overlaps to finding ways for its teams to work together on projects they might not have been able to pursue as well if they weren't part of the same company. We believe this will credibly result in some opportunity, reflected in our long-term revenue and profit forecast. In 2023, the firm completed the acquisition of ViaSat's data link networking business, as well as the more transformative Aerojet Rocketdyne, which supplies rocket motors and munitions to the defense and aerospace industry. Aerojet Rocketdyne has suffered recently from supply chain bottlenecks as many inputs for rockets are rare and may come from only one or two specialized suppliers. Its products are in sharp demand as global stockpiles of munitions, missiles, and rockets are depleted and restocked as a result of military conflicts in Ukraine, Israel, and elsewhere. Inclusion in the L3Harris portfolio should help with the supply chain as the larger firm has the people and resources to send to suppliers (and their suppliers) to work through bottlenecks.","L3Harris' strategy to position itself as the ""sixth prime"" U.S. defense contractor could offer growth potential if it is able to bid for programs it could not take on as a smaller and more specialized contractor. L3Harris is at the base of a global replacement cycle for tactical radios, which we think will drive substantial growth. Defense contractors operate in an acyclical business, which could offer some protection if the U.S. enters a recession.","L3Harris depends on U.S. military funding, which is an inherently political and thus uncertain process.  We expect that, for better or worse, L3Harris top line will be more reactive to changes in defense spending than longer-cycle peers. L3Harris recent acquisitions may distract management and have attracted regulatory scrutiny.",29/10/2023,"L3Harris Technologies is the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor by sales (13th globally, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). It formed in 2019 from the merger of L-3 Technologies, a sensormaker that operated a decentralized business focused on inorganic growth, and the Harris Corporation, a sensor and radio manufacturer that ran a more unified business. Underpinning the merger was an assumption that additional scale would primarily generate cost synergies and eventually, the firms could produce meaningful revenue synergies. With the recent addition of ViaSat's tactical data link business and most recently the $4.7 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris has opportunistically vaulted its strategy forward into becoming a more well-rounded defense prime contractor, adding munitions, space exploration, and hypersonic missile components and capabilities to its very radio- and communications-heavy base. That said, Aerojet supplies components to many other defense contractors, which isn't likely to change, and competes with the space segment of Northrop Grumman. We think it will take time for meaningful revenue synergies that weren't already in the backlog for L3Harris, ViaSat, or Aerojet to materialize. The defense budget allocation is a political process, which is inherently difficult to predict, so we favor companies with tangible growth profiles through a steady stream of contract wins, ideally to contracts that are fulfilled over decades. While many of L3Harris' products are replenished over a short- to medium-term timespan (in defense-industry context: years, not decades), many of these are integrated with long-lived platforms such as fighters and ships, where L3Harris has some incumbency advantage in rebidding for the next upgrade or refit. The Aerojet acquisition stands to augment this effect, simply in terms of the long duration of some of the programs it supplies motors and components for. The three biggest organic growth opportunities we see for L3Harris Technologies are the tactical radios replacement cycle, national security satellite asset decentralization, and international sales expansion.","The durability of economic profits in the defense sector may seem paradoxical: large defense contractors invest billions of dollars to generate products on the cutting edge of technology, and unit pricing for their products declines over time. What's more, these companies primarily sell to a single buyer (referred to as a monopsony in economic textbooks; in this case, it's the procurement arm of the U.S. Defense Department) with rapidly evolving needs, a tendency to change product requirements, and intermittent and sometimes politicized squabbles over paying the bill. The U.S. Defense Department counts tens of thousands of contractors among its suppliers, many of them small businesses, and any of these contracting directly with the government (itself a kind of intangible skill set) are referred to as ""prime contractors"" (sort of like the general contractor on a construction project) that routinely source from smaller subcontractors, suppliers, and one another for portions of the systems they design and deliver. Nonetheless, we observe that wide moats are prevalent at the large end of the defense contracting business. These durable competitive advantages exist because of significant intangible assets: first among these is the extreme product complexity that thwarts new entrants, bolstered by decadeslong product cycles, contract structures that reduce risk for incumbents and lock out alternative suppliers, as well as the switching costs of a risk-averse customer facing significant time and risk to potentially switch products or suppliers.We believe that intangible assets in the defense industry ensure that incumbent firms are the only companies capable of servicing the militarys large need to purchase arms (broadly defined), which manifests as a material barrier to entry. In terms of keeping competition at bay, we believe the primary source of intangible assets is product complexity. First, the technology used in arms production requires extensive and specialized expertise that also usually lacks commercial viability outside of the defense industry (aside from commercial aerospace manufacturing), so a new entrant would likely need to develop this know-how entirely from the ground up or acquire it outright, and we observe only a few capable incumbents in each major category of defense systems development. Second, the development of a military program is long and expensive; a would-be competitor would face material sunk costs ranging from the challenge of developing a workforce that has the required experience and/or security clearances to enter the space to the time and money spent developing a prototype to pitch for a contract. We note that the only serious outside threat to a small subsegment of this business, space launches, are the pet projects of multibillionaires. We use the Stockholm International Peace Research Institutes dataset on the arms industry as evidence that the arms production industry is insulated from outside competition: Lockheed Martin, along with Boeings defense unit, BAE Systems, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, and General Dynamics have remained the top six or seven global arms producers for the past 15 years (a Chinese state-owned enterprise is the seventh in some of those years).The second major intangible asset in the defense industry is the contract structure that allows excess return generation. Generally, defense prime contractors compete fiercely within initial bidding rounds to win contracts to design and develop a prototype for a new program. The government then usually selects one or more of the winning prototype bidders to deliver a small number of testable products, after which the winning prime contractor is awarded a low-rate initial production contract, followed by full-rate production and eventually sustainment business. After the original round of purchasing is completed, it is quite rare to see a government switch contractors. During the early stages of development and production, the government generally purchases using cost-plus contracts, which shift the financial burden of cost overruns to the customer, but the potential profit is lower. Given the immense risk of cost overruns in designing complex products such as bomber aircraft, this dynamic frequently works in the contractors favor. As programs age to the production phase, they tend to move toward fixed-price contracts, often split into phases or lots, where the unit economics evolve over time as production can be scaled up for a successful program. Although fixed-price contracts carry more financial risk because the burden of cost overruns rests on the contractor, they tend to be more profitable because manufacturing costs become better understood and can even decline significantly as a program ages and delivery volumes increase. Considering the opportunity for additional revenue and profits from maintenance of delivered weapons systems (""sustainment"" in the military contracting parlance), these mature program contracts often become long-standing cash cows because program life cycles can last decades.Switching costs for the military customer are generally predicated on the mission-criticality of the product, extended product cycles, a lack of viable alternative products, and the substantial time investment or risk involved in switching suppliers. The major products for U.S.-based defense contractors include military vehicles (including land, air, and sea-based vehicles), intelligence-gathering and communication systems, radars and sensors, and munitions. The ability for a military to succeed at its strategic objectives and defeat an adversary, as well as protecting the lives of soldiers and civilians, is contingent on these products working as intended, which we think protects the proven suppliers from upstart competition. Product cycles are a source of differentiation. We view the products with the longest procurement cycles, such as fighter jets and submarines, as the moatiest because contracts with decades-long fulfillments provide extraordinarily long-term revenue and profit visibility. We see short-cycle products, such as defense IT contracting, less favorably. As contracts for defense hardware essentially grant a monopoly over that product, we also see some modest switching costs stemming from a lack of viable alternatives, but this is partially mitigated by the governments right to license patents to third parties as well as the fact that product cycles for similar systems often overlap and may be provided by competing suppliers. More important to us is the extensive investment required to replicate a product that fulfills a mission. Product development in this industry ranges from years to decades, and if the military is dissatisfied with the product, it is much faster and easier to work with the existing contractor to fix it than to fund the development of a brand-new program to replace it. Following this framework, in which we view the moatiest segments as those with the most difficult-to-replicate products with the longest production and upgrade cycles, we give a narrow moat to L3Harris Technologies. We think that L3Harris Technologies benefits more from the switching costs related to the programs it deploys with customers than the inherent complexity of the development of very-long-cycle systems, which L3Harris provides integrations with but does not primarily design and manufacture like its larger competitors. L3Harris has built or acquired an enviable portfolio of communications, intelligence gathering, and avionics products, and we anticipate that the firm is more likely than not to continue earning excess returns. We constrain our moat rating to narrow, unlike several peer contractors, as its returns on invested capital are not as strong as peers and because we think the complexity-based intangible assets are less strong than peers. We also view the shorter-cycle nature of the firms portfolio less favorably. Much of the firms stand-alone products are low-price, higher volume products, and are thus more reactive to changes in the funding environment. We view L3Harris sensitivity to the overall budget less favorably than for products with long-term revenue visibility on platform products. The firm derives about 63% of its revenue as a prime contractor. While many of the firms C4ISR products are well integrated into longer-cycle products, some avionics and components are updated occasionally, which we view less favorably than prime contracts that seldom switch.Across all three of its business segments, though to somewhat varying degrees, we see L3Harris benefiting from product complexity-based intangible assets and switching costs stemming from mission criticality as well as placement of its products on longer-cycle platforms.Within integrated mission systems, the firm produces and maintains a diverse set of sensors and control systems within various military vehicles, ships, and aircraft as well as uncrewed underwater vehicles, or UUVs. These sensors are used for surveillance, targeting, and interfleet communication. We think L3Harris benefits from barriers to entry from the extensive expertise required to produce these high-end sensors and UUVs, and we anticipate that the lack of commercial viability outside of the defense industry keeps would-be competitors out of the industry. We see switching costs in the form of integration on longer-cycle and more-complex products, and we think the firm benefits from razor-and-blade dynamics with the aftermarket. The firm maintains the communications systems for attack submarines and ships that have decadeslong useful lives and are unlikely to change their communication systems to save on sensor maintenance.Within space and airborne systems, we see complexity-based barriers to entry on the advanced sensors and jammers. While we think many companies are capable of creating high-level sensors, only a few can produce military-grade sensors that are designed to operate despite adversaries best efforts to jam and disrupt them. Many of the firms contracts are classified in this segment, which further increases the barrier to entry. We see switching costs stemming from placement on more complex products. While most of the time, complex manufacturing processes mean that firms do not compete much once a product is integrated onto a platform, there are some instances of recompetes. F-35s Block 4 purchase included a dramatic upgrade to the cockpit and computers powering the aircraft. L3Harris won additional content on the F-35 from this upgrade, but we view the fact that the components were recompeted in the first place as indicative of less favorable business dynamics in comparison to the wide-moat defense contractors we cover. There is material technical know-how protecting these products from competition, but we believe switching costs are the more powerful moat source in this segment. The firm has managed the FAAs communications infrastructure for 25 years, and there is a substantial cost of failure if the customer switched to a product that didnt operate as intended. The communication system must also be secure as it manages defense facilities communications. We do not expect that aircraft manufacturers will choose untested suppliers for avionics that avoid collision due to the lethal cost of failure and the wide publication of aviation failures.Within communication systems, the firm produces military-grade encrypted radios and broadband communication equipment and has product placement on a variety of aircraft, ships, and other vehicles. We see some modest complexity-based intangible assets. While plenty of firms can create radios and broadband networks, far fewer can provide sufficient speed, encryption, and can operate properly despite adversary attempts to jam communication. We see the mission criticality of the product as the primary switching cost. As product failure can be lethal or lead to highly embarrassing fiascos, we expect that the military would be unwilling to switch to an untested supplier. The firm has a large and well-understood installed base, which means that the firm can upgrade products with minimal additional training from the government, which we think increases costs.","The major risks we see for L3Harris are geopolitical risks relating to the defense budgeting and sales process and execution risk related in part to the firm's recent spate of mergers & acquisitions. We assign a medium uncertainty rating to the stock.Although U.S. defense spending has risen recently, as has that of allied partners, the risk always remains that defense budgets get caught up in political wrangling; even if the money eventually gets approved, the Defense Department cannot spend it until that happens, which can hamper contractors' ability to plan and execute on existing contracts.L3Harris faces general execution risk related to delivering on its contracts. Supply chain issues and production challenges could continue to prevent it from meeting deadlines or other contractual obligations, affecting costs and putting L3Harris' customer relationships under strain. While fixed-price contracts are generally reserved for more mature programs that have well-understood costs, the contractor bears the financial risk of cost overruns for such programs, so a poorly executed development program could also harm the company financially. These execution risks are exacerbated by the company's recent series of acquisitions; itself the product of a combination of L3 and Harris, integrating sizable businesses like ViaSat's tactical data business and Aerojet Rocketdyne can distract management and increase the likelihood for surprises or misjudgments on pricing, staffing, and other execution fronts.We see moderate ESG risk to the firm from the nature of the company's business model. The company is a defense contractor that produces cutting edge technology for military purposes. We think there is a risk that the company would be unable to find sufficient human capital to continue designing high-quality products. A data breach may release substantial confidential information, which may in turn make it more difficult for the company to win new contracts.","We assign L3Harris Technologies a Standard capital allocation rating. This assessment is based on a sound balance sheet rating, a fair investments rating, and an appropriate shareholder distributions rating. The firm has a sound balance sheet, in our view. L3Harris' net debt was just shy of 3 turns of EBITDA at the end of 2022. We're expecting net debt will be less than 2.0 turns of EBITDA over our forecast period, even after the integration of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The firm's debt maturity schedule is spread out enough that we don't see meaningful refinancing risk.We think the firm's investments have been fair. The foundation of its strategy is to use the increased scale and centralization from the merger of equals between L3 and the Harris Corporation to produce a better cost structure and improve efficiency. While the firm achieved its synergy targets from that combination so far, it has also embarked on two sizable and potentially strategic deals: ViaSat's tactical data business, and the takeover of Aerojet Rocktdyne. Time will tell if execution on both deals results in increased returns on invested capital.We think the firm's shareholder distributions have been appropriate. It divested a sizable portion of noncore L3 assets in 2020 and 2021 and used the proceeds for share repurchases. Management intends to use a large proportion of free cash flow for share repurchases going forward. The firm has stated that it intends to refinance, rather than repay, much of its debt so that it can focus on repurchases. We think this is sensible for an acyclical defense contractor with a well-funded pension like L3Harris. That noted, while we understand the market rewards firms that pay shareholders, we would be more comfortable applying a lower cost of equity to the firm if it had less debt, so we think the firm could increase its intrinsic value by paying down debt.","L3Harris Technologies provides products for the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or C4ISR, market. The firm produces uncrewed aerial vehicles, sensors, and avionics, as well as provides military and commercial training services and maintains the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's communications infrastructure. In July 2023, the company acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne, a key supplier of rocket motors to the space and defense industry.","We think L3Harris is in solid financial shape. We project a 2023 gross debt/EBITDA of roughly 3.0 times, including the Aerojet Rocketdyne deal and related debt issuance. Between 2019 and 2022, while its indebtedness hovered around $7 billion, the company returned over $11 billion to investors in the form of share repurchases ($8.3 billion) and dividends ($3 billion), augmented by about $4.3 billion in proceeds from portfolio divestitures. In 2023 L3Harris issued just over $3 billion of new notes to finance most of the Aerojet acquisition. We're anticipating EBTIDA expansion will be the driving force behind any decreasing debt/EBITDA ratio over our forecast period.L3Harris produces a substantial amount of free cash flow and is not especially indebted, so we anticipate that the company would be able to access the capital markets to refinance debt or fund its next acquisition at minimal cost if necessary. Management has indicated that ViaSat and Aerojet Rocketdyne are likely its last deals for a few years.",LHX,Industrials,36901543936.0,NYQ,1109921.0,USD,187.8300018310547,True,1,176.57517915612706,206.34045542022469,1

Quick service restaurant operator no-moat Collins Foods and master franchisee narrow-moat Dominos Pizza screen as undervalued.

Hard times also mean more shopliftingan industrywide phenomenon. We expect the tailwind of grocery price inflation to moderate, while wages and other costs for supermarkets are pushing higher, resulting in softer operating margins. Further, we think a de-rating of defensive yield stocks is a risk, with wide-moat Endeavour screening as undervalued and least exposed.

Metcashs acquisitive expansion of its hardware business has diversified the companys earnings and cash flows away from the lower profit margins generated by its food and liquor businesses.  Strategic and cost-cutting initiatives undertaken by Metcash have been successful. Further, independent supermarket operators across all states are stepping up investments in better stores.","Intense competition between Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi is likely reduce sales volumes of the independent channel and could make it increasingly hard for Metcash to support its customers in matching shelf prices of the majors. Metcash's independent retail customers effectively compete through product differentiation, convenience, and service. These points of difference are likely to become marginalised during economic downturns.  Metcash is at market maturity in wholesale grocery in Australia and there is little opportunity to grow the business domestically. ",27/06/2023,"Metcash dominates the Australian wholesale distribution of packaged groceries to the independent retailer. From the small corner shop to the local independent supermarket, Metcash acts as a co-operative, funnelling independent sales volume through a single channel to derive buying power to negotiate volume discounts with manufacturers. Metcash is the fourth force in the grocery industry, with around 10% market share via its IGA banner network, while Woolworths and Coles combined account for about two thirds of Australian food retailing, and Aldi also commands a comparable market share of around 10%. The vertically integrated supermarkets Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi own and operate their own distribution infrastructure that is not accessible to independent retailers. The fierce competitive tension between these groups, which capture about 75% of supermarket sales, means independent retailers need to differentiate to remain competitive. Independent retailers are commonly run by locals catering to the local demands of a community, with stores tailored to match specific demographic tastes.  Some independents have been protected by their exposure to smaller catchment areas which are too small to support a big box supermarket. However, we expect the rapidly growing e-commerce capabilities of Woolworths and Coles to allow them to effectively service smaller catchment areas and gradually erode the independents' advantage of a physical store presence.  Australian hardware and home improvement records over AUD 70 billion in annualised sales. Bunnings, which is owned by Wesfarmers, holds the largest market share at around 20% of sales. Metcash's revenue in hardware, including charge-through sales, was over 3 billion in fiscal 2023. About 60% of the hardware customer base consists of tradespeople, with whom independents have strong relationships and compete effectively with market leader Bunnings. The acquisition of a majority stake in Total Tools in 2020 further strengthened Metcash's position in the trade segment of the hardware market.  ","Metcash does not have a scale advantage over larger competitors, and independent retailers are unable to differentiate enough to offset higher prices; for these reasons, we do not believe Metcash has an economic moat. Metcash has little capital tied up in its operations, with stores mostly owned by private enterprises, while it leases warehouse and other equipment. This capital-light business has enabled Metcash to deliver strong returns on capital over the past decade. Revenue is supported by consumers' focus on a differentiated product range and convenient store locations, rather than just on value. Competition within the supermarket channel is intense, with Coles defending its market share from arch-rival Woolworths. This competitive tension between the majors keeps their prices low and maintains a discrepancy in value between these larger banner groups and the smaller independent retailers. Consumers are price-sensitive, with discounter Aldi commanding some 10% market share. The outlook for a period of cyclically weak real wage growth is likely to underpin the demand for value, driving more traffic to discounters like Aldi and Costco. The independents' advantage of convenient locations is threatened by the ongoing migration of consumers to the online channel. The restrictions during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this migration and Woolworths and Coles sell close to 10% online. Metcash's independents are significantly underindexed in online, with penetration in the low-single digits. The hardware wholesaling division does not have the scale of its largest competitor, Bunnings, and we view its contribution as less material, representing a little over 40% of group earnings in fiscal 2023. The acquisition of Home Timber and Hardware from Woolworths in 2016 and the majority stake in Total Tools in 2020 diversified earnings, but not enough to offset the structural market dynamics challenging the relatively low-margin food and liquor segments.","We assign Metcash a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Metcash mostly operates in the consumer staples sector, with demand for food and liquor highly stable and correlated with population growth and inflation. However, the firm is a distributor of commoditised products and must therefore offer competitive retail prices to maintain its relevance in the sector. The firm's ability to offer competitive prices to its retailing customers is largely dependent on its cost base, and Metcash has a scale disadvantage in the Australian supermarket sector. Profit margins in the Australian supermarket industry were rebased lower in the last decade, meaning small falls in revenue can have a more significant impact on profits. Another key risk facing Metcash are discount supermarket chain Aldi and, to a lesser degree, Costco, which have relatively low cost structures and can maintain retail prices significantly below those of independent grocers in the IGA-bannered network. The IGA network's low online penetration is likely to stifle sales growth over the next decade.Metcash faces several environmental, social, and governance risks primarily from carbon emissions related to energy consumption at its operations, the quality and safety of its products, and human capital. However, we ascribe these risks a low probability of occurring. Besides, we dont expect significant destruction of shareholder value, were these ESG risks to materialise.Regarding its carbon footprint, Metcashs distribution centres and warehouses account for most of its energy consumption and present opportunities for greater energy efficiency. Metcash already reduced energy usage, measured in MWh, in excess of 10% in the four years to fiscal 2020. The firm is committed to reducing energy usage by a further 10% by fiscal 2025. Metcashs growing range of Community Company private-label products adhere to responsible sourcing principles, including maintainable sourcing of palm oil and meat products. ","We determine a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Metcash. The balance sheet is in a sound position, investments have historically been value-accretive, and shareholder distributions have been appropriate.Metcash is in a reasonably strong financial position and the defensive nature of its revenue place the business in a solid position to weather a cyclical downturn. Supporting the balance sheet is an acceptable net debt position of AUD 349.6 million (excluding lease liabilities) as at April 2023, and access to further liquidity in the form of undrawn debt facilities of approximately AUD 600 million.Investments have predominantly been in hardware. While they havent aided in building an economic moat, they have added shareholder value. The downside to Metcashs investment profile is a historical underinvestment in the online grocery sales channel, which has led to the business now playing catch up with the dominating integrated supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, which are quickly approaching online sales penetration in the double digits.Distributions to shareholders have been appropriate. Dividends have sensibly been reduced during difficult periods, such as in fiscal 2015 and 2016 when the growth of discounter Aldi forced it to reset its food margins at a lower level. In fiscal 2021, Metcash increased its dividend payout ratio target to 70% of adjusted underlying earnings from 60%, underpinned by its strong balance sheet and the stabilising of its underlying earnings over recent years.We support Metcashs share repurchases at a discount to fair value, such as the AUD 150 million buyback in fiscal 2018 at AUD 2.26 per share. The equity raising at an 8% discount during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent buyback of shares at a premium to our fair value just over a year later can be viewed as a black mark on Metcashs capital allocation. However, the additional liquidity allowed Metcash to operate throughout the pandemic with minimal disruption to its key businesses and provided greater security in a highly uncertain trading environment. Further, returning excess capital to shareholders as trading uncertainty related to the pandemic waned was also sensible, despite the premium paid for the shares. ","Metcash is a wholesale distribution and marketing company specialising in food, liquor, and hardware. Centralised wholesale distribution enables retailers to gain access to the combined scale of many retailers to negotiate material volume discounts.The food segment distributes of a range of products and services to independent supermarket and convenience stores. The hardware segment distributes hardware products to independent retail outlets and operates company-owned stores. The liquor segment distributes liquor products to independent retailers and pubs. ","In fiscal 2023, Metcash had net debt of some AUD 349.6 million. Maturities of existing debt facilities are spread out between fiscal 2023 and 2029. Gearing levels remain conservative with a net debt leverage rate of 0.62 times, well below management's target ratio.We expect Metcash to continue paying out 70% of its underlying EPS in dividends, offering an attractive fully franked yield of 5% at our fair value estimate.

24/11/2023,Associated British Foods Optimistic on Profit Recovery as Primark Appeals to Cash-Strapped Consumers,Associated British Foods PLC,ABF,3,07/11/2023,Diana Radu,2372.0,GBP,23/11/2023,2370.0,Medium,,Standard,,07/11/2023,"We increase our fair value estimate for no-moat Associated British Foods, or ABF, by 5% to GBX 2,370 following a solid set of fiscal 2023 results and an increase in our 2024 margin assumptions to 8.8% from 8.2% previously. This is supported by an optimistic outlook from management, guiding for a substantial improvement in profitability for both the sugar and the retail businesses. The share price was up around 7% in intraday trading, leaving shares relatively fairly valued. The decision to absorb some of the transitory cost inflation at Primark in order to maintain the retailers characteristic low prices in times of pressure on disposable incomes appears to have paid off for ABF. Primark reported like-for-like sales growth of 8.5% in fiscal 2023 and continued to gain market share in the U.K. Still, higher input costs weighed on the retailers operating margin that ended the year at 8.2%, around 160 basis points lower than the previous year. Management expects Primarks operating margin to recover to above 10% in fiscal 2024, supported by input cost normalization in areas such as freight and material costs. Like-for-like revenue growth is expected to be more muted (2% in our forecast). Still, we expect total revenue growth of around 7% for Primark, driven by further expansion of the store network. Our forecast calls for an additional 25 store openings in fiscal 2024, one more than the total number of stores opened in the last year. Sugar revenue was up by 29% in constant currency, supported by high sugar prices. This was despite an 8% fall in total production as a result of adverse weather in Europe. The operating margin was down by 140 basis points on account of higher costs for beet, cane, and energy as well as the need to buy and import sugar to make up for the extraordinarily low British sugar production. For the next fiscal year, management expects a substantial improvement in profitability primarily driven by a normalization in British sugar production.","Primark is in the expansion phase and new store additions will likely drive earnings growth for years to come.  Given Primarks rock-bottom prices and managements commitment to maintaining price leadership, we believe the retailer is well-positioned to navigate periods of high inflation and appeal to cash-strapped consumers. ABF's sugar segment is benefiting from Illovos strong profitability bedrock, the result of its growing downstream operations and strong regional and local market position.","The lack of an online retail business represents a potential hindrance to long-term growth, as Primark stands to miss out on about 50% of consumers budget allocation to the channel by 2029.  Given Primarks low price positioning and focus on maintaining price attractiveness, we believe it is likely that input cost inflation would hit margins rather than be passed on to consumers. The company is exposed to highly volatile commodity prices, including sugar and grains, over which management has no power or control.",07/11/2023,"Although we think that Associated British Foods', or ABF's, mass-apparel retail division Primarkshould deliver consistent growth through its expansion over the short term, supported by a reliable performance from the remaining largely commodified food divisions, we believe that the companys potential will be limited over the long term by intense competition and a lack of differentiation, leading to our no-moat rating. Primark delivered a strong performance over the decade preceding the pandemic and we expect it to return to healthy growth rates in the short term. Its business model, which calls for low prices, high volumes, and large stores that offer an enjoyable shopping experience has proven popular with consumers and is likely to fare well in a period of significant cost of living challenges. Over the longer term, however, we expect to see a gradual decline in like-for-like growth rates, and operating margins falling short of prepandemic heights. We believe that increased competition, stemming largely from emerging digital-only players, and declining footfall on high streets as more retailers close down stores will hurt Primarks model given the lack of an online business. These dynamics, along with the smaller store format planned as part of the expansion stand to reduce, in our view, Primarks sales densities and consequently its operating leverage. In its food businesses, ABF enjoys strong market positions across sugar, ingredients, and animal feed, however, a lack of differentiation for the bulk of the portfolio translates into single-digit operating margins and limited growth opportunities. Despite that, we believe there are some pockets of growth that management is right to explore, such as specialized animal nutrition and an expansion into adjacent markets for its products, such as the alternative meat space for the yeast extracts.  The grocery unit produces food and beverage brands with little pricing power that do not occupy center-stage positions in supermarkets. Growth has been lagging the market, and the segment's operating margin is significantly lower than that of larger, competitively advantaged consumer goods firms (10% versus midteens).","We assign a no-moat rating to ABF, with none of the heterogeneous businesses that make up the group enjoying a durable competitive advantage, in our view. Roughly half of ABFs sales come from a set of food businesses with commodity-like features, while the other half is generated by Primarka leading fast-fashion retailer. The strong discipline that management has shown in keeping costs down in the retail segment and the scale of Primarks operations have created a business model that appears to enjoy cost advantages compared with peers, with prices that are up to 50% lower than larger retailers such as H&M, but a similar operating margin as a result of a leaner cost structure. However, given the outsourced production process that does not set Primark apart from its fast-fashion competitors and its subpar digital capabilities that might hinder its long-term ability to stay ahead of emerging trends, we do not believe that Primarks cost advantage is durable enough to warrant an economic moat for the group. This is further exacerbated by the lack of an online business, which makes Primark vulnerable to changing consumer shopping habits and increased competition from brands establishing a strong online presence. Prior to 2020, ABF generated a fairly stable 11% return on invested capital. However, the retail operation lost two-thirds of profits during the pandemic given prolonged store closures, which in turn led to return on invested capital falling below our 8.2% weighted cost of capital. We anticipate ROIC will recover as restrictions have been lifted across Primarks markets. Nonetheless, we remain wary of increased competition that could challenge economic profit generation prospectively. Primarks low-cost model resonates with its customers, delivering some of the lowest prices in the value segment of the apparel market. It is apparent that business decisions are pondered primarily through a cost-saving lens. This includes the choice of suppliers, large order sizes that are placed at off-peak times, and low-cost logistics. The unrivaled sales density of its stores, the conscious choice to avoid the e-commerce channel and its associated high fulfillment costs, and the negligible advertising and marketing expenses all further enhance Primarks superior cost position. While Primarks low-cost operations have delivered economic profits to investors over the preceding decade, we dont view the model as irreplaceable. Admittedly, new entrants would find it difficult to amass the scale needed to compete with Primark on unit costs. However, we believe this could be achievable for a well-capitalized competitor. Speaking directly to this point, Sheinthe privately held Chinese fast-fashion retailerhas amassed a substantial share of the global market by employing a digital-only, data-driven operating model. According to data from Earnest Research, a consultancy, Shein became the largest fast-fashion retailer in the U.S. in 2021, overtaking H&M, the previous leader in mass-market apparel. Sheins prices are similar to those of Primark, perhaps slightly higher excluding markdowns, but it offers a continuously refreshed assortment, introducing between 5,000 and 10,000 new stock-keeping units every day on its website and app. Sheins data-driven model allows it to be much more reactive than Primark, churning out new designs very quickly. Shein places small initial orders with its vast network of local Chinese manufacturers that it incentivizes by offering attractive trade terms. By contrast, Primarks model forces it to place large orders for focused ranges multiple months in advance with suppliers located in countries like Bangladesh and India, in order to secure low unit costs and to allow for cost-effective distribution to its physical stores. Sheins business model and its extraordinary revenue growth (at an estimated 100% compounded annual rate over the last five years) is proof that the value apparel market in which Primark plays is ripe for disruption, with data-driven online pure-players being able to tune in and capitalize much faster on emerging trends, especially amongst their target younger consumers.Primark has an overall lean cost structure, with virtually no customer acquisition costs and a complete lack of traditional advertising campaigns (versus H&Ms typical marketing budget of around 3%-3.5% of revenue and around 4% for no-moat Gap and Fast Retailing). Instead, it relies extensively on social media and word of mouth from positive customer experiences with the companys products and stores (and as a result, in some cases brand awareness exists even in countries/markets with no actual store presence). For instance, Primark has around 10 million Instagram followers, which is significantly lower than the 38 million and the 50 million followers for H&M and Zara, respectively. However, this total translates into 680,000 followers per active market for Primark, versus 510,000 for H&M and 520,000 for Zara. Primarks website is also used as a marketing tool, but it is rudimentary when compared with those of peers, especially outside of the U.K., with low picture quality and limited capabilities. It resembles more a fashion catalogue and photo sharing website (it features a Primania section, where customers are encouraged to upload photos of their new looks) than the website of an apparel retailer. The company is investing in capabilities that should enable customers to check if a certain store carries a particular product, but it has no current plans of giving additional information like available sizes, stock levels, or the ability to reserve a product online for pick up in-store, which we view as critical. That also suggests that there are no prospects in the medium-term for Primark to offer online sales fulfillment. Admittedly, Primark's distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue are orders of magnitude lower than those of pure-online retailers like boohoo.com and Asos (around 45% for both versus 14% for Primark UK). But despite this, Primarks operating margin is similar to that of no-moat H&M, and about 800 basis points lower than that of narrow-moat Inditex. Both of these players derived on average 30% of their sales from the online channel in 2020 and 2021, boosted by the pandemic. According to Morningstar estimates, the online penetration of apparel sales should reach 45% by 2029 in Western Europe from approximately 25% currently. The high costs for fulfilling online orders, coupled with prices that are on average 50% lower compared with those of competitors suggest that there is no current scenario in which an e-commerce business would make economical sense for Primark given its operating margin of around 10%. This suggests that in the long-term Primark stands to miss out as customers allocate an increasing share of their budget to online purchases. Nonetheless, we believe its stores will remain attractive in the near term as consumers are increasingly looking for experiences and the opportunity to once again socialize in retail environments following the prolonged restrictions and lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. A key part of Primarks business model involves making the stores a destination on their own merit, with some of the most popular stores attracting tourists and people from neighboring areas where a store is not present. Management aims to maximize the time consumers spend in stores by providing unique experiences such as a Disney restaurant or a Friends TV-series-themed caf. This strategy is reflected in best-in-class sales densities of an approximate EUR 6,400/square meterwhich we estimate are almost triple those of H&M (EUR 2,300/square meter) and more than 30% higher than Inditex's (EUR 4,700/square meterwhich is the biggest contributor to Primarks cost leadership. Sales densities twice as high as some peers in combination with 50% lower prices on average imply roughly 4 times higher volumes per square foot versus scale-advantaged peers such as H&M. Primark's larger selling area per store relative to competitors (average selling area per store of around 40,000 square feet versus less than 20,000 square feet for Inditex and H&M) contributes to its ability to leverage fixed and semi-fixed expenditures and drive down unit costs. Larger store sizes allow for greater operational leverage as overheads are better fractionalised given fewer deliveries from warehouses to retail locations relative to retailers with a large number of smaller stores. However, we expect that over the long term consumers will become more accustomed to online shopping, and allocate a larger share of their budget to the online channel, resulting in an acceleration of high street store closures by competitors. This should in turn affect Primarks footfall, impacting its operating leverage and margin, further supporting our thesis that Primarks current cost advantage is not likely to persist over the next decade.The rest of ABFs business segments accounted for 50% of group revenue and 40% of operating profit in its fiscal year 2019 (prepandemic). We do not believe the remaining segments benefit from any distinguishable competitive advantages, but are largely well managed and therefore not value destructive. In the sugar segment, the majority of sales are generated by Illovo, the largest sugar processor in Africa. ABF also owns the sole sugar processor that utilizes the U.K.'s beet crop, British Sugar, as well as Azucarera Ebro in Iberia (Spain), and two sugar beet factories in North China. However, with the product essentially a commodity, sugar producers are price takers making it challenging to generate returns on invested capital in excess of the cost of capital. ABFs grocery segment operates a portfolio of over 40 food and beverage brands. While a select few of the portfolios brands benefit from favorable competitive positionsincluding the Twinings tea and Ovaltine beverage brands, which have leading market positions in their focus regionswe believe that most of the brands in the portfolioincluding the likes of Allied Bakeries, Westmill Foods, AB World Foodsdo not benefit from pricing power, do not occupy center-stage positions in supermarkets, and do not drive customer footfall to stores. Similarly, the segments bakery productsconsisting mainly of packaged breadhave experienced significant market share loss (especially in the U.K.) due to more attractive private-label substitutes (including bakery stands in supermarkets). Consequently, operating margins for the segment, which averaged 10% over the last five years, are significantly lower than the mid-to high-teens levels seen for rival consumer goods companies that we believe benefit from economic moats. ","We assign ABF a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The business is exposed to volatile commodity prices, notably sugar and grain, currencies (especially the U.S. dollar and euro), and fashion and political risk (the sugar operations in Africa). Despite these numerous risk sources, we believe the heterogeneous nature of the portfolio provides some diversification benefits, as showcased during the pandemic when increased demand in ABFs food businesses compensated to some extent for the lower profit on the retail side.We believe the COVID-19 pandemic could have long-term implications on shopping habits, with consumers expected to allocate an increasingly large share of their budget to online shopping over the next decade. This could impact Primarks revenue disproportionately given the lack of online sales and the potentially declining footfall in its large high street retail locations. Currencies can have a large impact on margins and earnings, particularly from a transactional point of view as ABF buys its raw materials (grain, cotton, and wool) and pays its manufacturers in U.S. dollars, but generates most of its revenue in British pounds and euros.Finally, we believe the company is exposed to ESG risks. Increasing concern around the waste created in the mass apparel sector could induce consumers to purchase fewer clothes, hurting Primarks volume lead model. The Primark Cares program introduced in 2021 aims to increase the durability of the clothes and the share of recycled and sustainably sourced materials that are used. This could in turn erode profitability as the associated costs of implementation are unlikely to be passed on to consumers.Incidents related to poor working conditions for workers in its supply chain could result in further consumer backlash, while improvements in working conditions would require a concerted effort across the industry given that Primark is reliant on third-party manufacturers that work with multiple brands and retailers. ","We assign ABF a Standard capital allocation rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investment discipline, and appropriate shareholder distributions. ABF maintains a strong balance sheet, characterized by low financial leverage and good free cash flow generation. The group had a ratio of net debt including lease liabilities to EBITDA of 1 time in September 2023. We dont expect significant increases in financial leverage going forward given that ABF has introduced a capital allocation policy that targets a ratio of net debt including lease liabilities to EBITDA of well under 1.5 times at each reporting date.We believe ABFs investment efficacy is fair, with management deploying resources to expand Primarks network of stores, carefully entering new markets in a well-researched manner. However, we believe that investments in digital capabilities and the better integration of Primarks social media channels and its website have significantly lagged peers and will require much more focus in the future. In the other segments, the company has succeeded in moving away from some of the more commoditized products in agriculture and ingredients and into higher-margin value-added items, boosting growth rates, particularly in ingredients. Historically there has been a strong focus on organic growth, with acquisitions being sparse and bolt-on in nature, following a prudent approach. Indeed, management has previously stated that interest in some targets has waned in the face of what it perceived as inflated valuations. ABFs approach to shareholder distribution is appropriate, with management steadily increasing dividends in the years prior to the pandemic at a compounded annual growth rate of 8% between 2011 and 2019. Dividends were discontinued in 2020 as a means to preserve cash in the face of heightened uncertainty, however, they were promptly reinstated in 2021. Special dividends are also used as a means to return excess cash to shareholders as was the case in fiscal 2021 and 2023. Over the long term, the company policy is to pay out one-third of net profits as dividends, which we view as reasonable given the firms expansion aspirations.ABF is controlled by Wittington Investments, which holds a 54.5% majority stake in the group. Wittington Investments might impose a constraint on financing if ABF were to attempt a major acquisition as we assume it would seek to retain majority control. There is a single share class, with each share carrying one vote.","Associated British Foods is a diversified international retail, food, and ingredients group with 130,000 employees and operations in 50 countries across Europe, southern Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia. The group sells branded grocery products, grows and processes sugar, supplies farmers with crop input and animal feed, and runs the popular Primark clothing retail chain. It also supplies ingredients like baker's yeast, enzymes, lipids, and cereal specialities. Some 40% of sales are in the U.K., and Primark generates more than half of the firm's operating profit.","We believe that ABF is in strong financial health, characterized by a robust balance sheet, good free cash flow generation, and a healthy dividend payment (around a third of net profits). The group had a net cash position of GBP 1.5 billion as of September 2022 and carried negligible debt. The group ratio of net debt including lease liabilities to EBITDA was around 1 time in 2023, in line with the previous year. We do not believe ABF has any liquidity concerns, and it has been able to maintain a strong cash flow generation even during the Covid-19 crisis when its stores were closed for extended periods of time. This has largely been the result of good working capital management and a decrease in capital expenditure. Furthermore, the group chose to skip the 2020 dividend in order to preserve cash. Capital spending has been relatively high at ABF historically on account of Primark's expansion, averaging more than 5.0% of sales in the decade preceding the pandemic. We forecast slightly lower capital spending going forward, at around 4.6% of sales over the next five years, as we expect the net floorspace annual addition to be slightly below historical averages given that the expansion plans feature a smaller store format for some of the focus markets, such as the U.S. and Iberia.We believe ABFs cash flow is sufficient to meet its needs. We do not expect the firm to require additional funding in the foreseeable future. The group also has substantial borrowing facilities available to it, amounting to GBP 1.5 billion as of September 2023. We believe further financing could be provided by the majority shareholder, Wittington Investments, an investment vehicle of the Weston family. The holding company shareholder structure would only be a constraint for management if it sought a large acquisition that couldn't be entirely paid for with available cash, requiring a significant enough capital increase to dilute the holding company below the 50% control.",ABF.L,Consumer Defensive,18124754944.0,LSE,88902.0,GBp,2370.0,True,0,2048.570900140799,2322.6192582831327,0
25/11/2023,China Telecom Transitioning to Industrial Digitization Giant,China Telecom Corp Ltd,00728,5,,Dan Baker,3.6,HKD,24/11/2023,5.0,Low,,Standard,,,No Text Available,"China Telecom's fixed-line business generates significant cash flow, which can be used to invest in its broadband and wireless networks. The firm has increased its wireless base more than 13 times since acquiring the business in 2008; it has also expanded its share of mobile services revenue from 12% in 2012 to 21% in 2022. China Telecom's mobile business is benefiting from the move to a global standards for 4G and 5G after battling a poorer handset ecosystem with 3G CDMA. 5G radio network sharing with China Unicom also helps its cost competitiveness and network rollout speed.","China Telecom is the second smallest of the three big Chinese wireless telecom operators. Compared with its largest competitor, it lacks the scale to reduce unit costs. It remains to be seen if operators will be able to get sufficient returns from their expenditure on 5G network rollouts.  China Telecom is controlled by the Chinese government, whose objectives may not be aligned with those of minority shareholders.",23/10/2023,"China Telecom benefited from the 2008 Chinese telecom reorganization and has made the most of the changes. With the reorganization, the firm received 29 million wireless subscribers from China Unicom. Since then, it has increased its wireless base more than 13 times to 406 million as it leveraged its strong fixed-line franchise. This growth has enabled the business to become more profitable as the networks fixed costs are spread over a much larger customer base. In that time frame, the firm also more than doubled its broadband customer base to over 189 million as it worked hard to cross-sell additional services to its existing fixed-line customer base. To encourage broadband users, the firm has been rolling out fibre into its fixed-line network to provide its customers with faster speeds, with over 96% of its broadband customers on fibre to the home at year-end 2022 and over 220 million homes passed with FTTH. Still, increasing competition from China Mobile in fixed broadband since 2016 has posed a threat to pricing, with broadband average revenue per user down 30% in the five years to 2022.  The company is looking to expand its already sizable industrial digitization business with plans to grow its associated capital expenditure by 40% to CNY 38 billion in 2023, and an aim to grow its cloud services revenue to at least CNY 100 billion in 2023. The firm's IDC and cloud businesses have experienced very strong growth, and China Telecom is in a position to leverage its existing network and capital firepower to make further inroads into these areas. In terms of reported cloud service revenue, China Telecom overtook Alibaba as the largest in China in first half 2023.  While the industrial digitization business and cloud services are likely lower-margin than traditional telecom services, the challenge for China Telecom will be to increase margins as the scale of these businesses grows. ","We believe that China Telecom does not have an economic moat, given that it has earned returns below its cost of capital over the past 10 years and we expect the same over the next 10 years. If it were able to generate higher returns, we could see qualitative arguments for a moat, given the favorable market structure. China has three main operators serving a huge market, and we believe it is unlikely that the Chinese government will allow foreign firms to enter what is considered a strategically important sector such as telecommunications. However, it is the majority government ownership of all three telecom companies and apparent lack of concern about generating acceptable returns that leads us to assign no moat to China Telecom. Despite both China Unicom and China Telecom earning below weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, returns, the government has taken an active role in setting industrywide prices and price-reduction targets over the period from 2016 to 2018, which slowed revenue and profit growth, making it more difficult for the smaller operators to lift their returns toward WACC. The delay in issuing 3G licensesmeaning a concentrated investment period in 3G, then 4G, and soon 5G mobile networks in a shorter time than other marketshas also not helped returns. The industry is also unbalanced. While we estimate that the industry as a whole is earning above WACC returns, China Mobile, with a mobile business nearly 3 times the size of the other operators, is earning outsize returns while the smaller operators earn below WACC. Other Chinese state-controlled industries that are currently tolerating below WACC returns from their key operators include railways, particularly as it relates to passenger railway operators, coal power producers, whose returns are capped by electricity prices set by the government and various tollway owners. With government influencing bank lending and even private investment in the telecom operators when required, as we saw in 2017 with the recapitalizing of China Unicom, the below WACC returns do not inhibit the telecom operators from funding their businesses. They should therefore be able to continue to fund important network rollouts for Chinas high-tech future even if they dont earn economic profits.China Telecom is the incumbent fixed-line telecom operator in 21 provinces in southern China. It has just over twice as many fixed-line customers than China Unicom, with most also subscribing to its broadband business. Customers with multiple services tend to be stickier and more valuable. Thus, while China Telecom continues to lose fixed-line telephone subscribers because of mobile substitution, the growth in its broadband base limits those declines. The broadband business has 189 million customers and despite continuing to grow at around 10 million customers per year, has seen market share declines over the past four years as China Mobile has aggressively entered this space with pricing well below China Telecom. The strong cash flow from the firm's fixed-line business, with its largely sunk network costs, drive a narrow moat in many telecom markets but China Telecoms low consolidated returns preclude this. China Telecom also has industry-leading scale in its data center and cloud services businesses but returns on these businesses are not disclosed and we understand that at this stage, profitability on the cloud business may be very low or even negative.","We assign China Telecom a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low as most of its core services are considered staples where demand does not vary much with the economy. As with the other Chinese telecom operators, we think the greatest risks to China Telecom are government intervention and competition. With the government being the firm's owner, competitor, customer, and regulator, it has many objectives that can be at cross purposes. Ultimately, government decisions can either help or hurt China Telecom. Other government-related risks could come from periodic anticorruption drives, especially given its majority government ownership, which could expose the company to business ethics risks. From a competitive standpoint, China Mobile has marketed its 4G and 5G networks aggressively, which has put pressure on pricing and margins for China Telecom mobile. Pricing pressure has also increased in fixed-line broadband in certain high-value areas as China Mobile has increased its focus in that market. China Unicom has also made a strong push in mobiles since 2017 and has helped lift competitive intensity in the mobile market.The government has a history of mandating price reductions in the telecom industry. The key concern for investors is that we have little in the way of guidelines regarding what government measures could be implemented in the future. However while further mandated price cuts can't be ruled out, we think these will likely be more measured, given the governments incentive to encourage spending on 5G network rollouts and applications by all operators.Additionally, China Telecom handles a significant amount of personally identifiable information in its daily operations, exposing it to data privacy and security risks. Finally, with 5G networks and internet data centers consuming significantly more energy, the company is increasingly exposed to risks of energy cost increases and energy price fluctuations.","We assess the capital allocation of China Telecom as Standard. China Telecom is 70.9% owned by parent China Telecom Group, which in turn is owned by the Chinese government. Given the government's strong influence over all three listed Chinese telecom companies' strategies, we do not see the choice of CEO as crucial as it would be at a non-state-owned firm. We think China Telecom's purchase of China Unicom's CDMA business and its acquisition of its 3G network from its parent were good uses of cash, though it's debatable how much management was really involved. From an execution perspective, China Telecom's steady increase in mobile services revenue share from 12% in 2012 to 21% in 2022 is a testament to management's persistent operational success. In 2012 China Telecoms revenue base was only 23% higher than China Unicoms but in the following eight years China Telecom produced over two and a half times the operating profit of China Unicom. In short it has executed well, but strategic decisions and takeovers have only had a small influence on China Telecom, in our estimate.China Telecoms balance sheet is strong, with CNY 66 billion in net cash at the end of 2022. The balance sheet has been maintained at net debt/EBITDA of under 1 over the past 10 years, which is also considered solid for a telecom company. However, the company did an A share listing and capital raise in 2021, which has put it in a net cash position and this seems overly conservative, in our view. We would encourage the company to consider a buyback of H share stock which have traded at a significant discount to the A share stock since the A share listing.The companys lifting of its dividend payout ratio to at least 65% is very reasonable, in our view, given the A share listing and capital raise. We are also comfortable with the planned lifting of this payout ratio to at least 70% three years after the A share listing.","China Telecom is the largest fixed-line operator in China, originally covering 21 southern provinces. It has 102 million fixed-line subscribers, 189 million broadband customers, and 406 million wireless subscribers, having overtaken China Unicom to become the second-largest wireless operator in China behind China Mobile. The firm is increasing its cross-selling of products and seeing strong growth from industrial digitization services, such as internet data centers and cloud computing. Its internet data center business is already the largest in China, with a plan to have 560,000 cabinets by end 2023.","For a telecom operator, the balance sheet is strong, in a net cash position at the end of third quarter 2023. This is an unusually strong balance sheet for a telecom company with strong cash flows. China Telecom has focused its capital expenditure on its 5G network with shared radio access with China Unicom. Capital expenditure declined from CNY 109 billion in 2015 to CNY 75 billion in 2018 but had consistently increased since then due to the 5G network rollout and more recently the increased spending on industrial internet. 2023 capital expenditure is forecast at CNY 99 billion due to a significant step-up in spending on industrial internet. The company has either maintained or raised its dividend in recent history, increasing its dividend from CNY 0.170 in 2021 to CNY 0.196 in 2022. This equates to a payout ratio of around 65%, up from around 40% during the years 2017 to 2020. The company has said it is targeting at least 70% in three years after its A share listing. We see this as very positive for investors.",0728.HK,Communication Services,498918096896.0,HKG,34836536.0,HKD,3.609999895095825,True,1,3.7255895970855417,3.8628395251296297,1
24/11/2023,"Without Film or TV Studios or a Streaming Service, Fox Relies Almost Entirely on News and Sports",Fox Corp,FOX,4,02/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,28.35,USD,23/11/2023,43.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,02/11/2023,"Fox continued to increase revenue in its fiscal first quarter, despite tough comparisons from the political election season in the same period last year and a continuing trend of declining cable subscriptions. Pricing strength and the success of Tubi, the firms free streaming service, offset the headwinds. We are maintaining our $43 fair value estimate. Total revenue was up less than 1% year over year, with 2% growth in affiliate revenue more than offsetting a 2% decline in advertising revenue. We suspect the success the firm is having with Tubi, its ad-supported streaming service, helped blunt the lack of political ads in the quarter. Management said the womens World Cup and timing of college football broadcasts also boosted ad revenue. We believe the firms heavy reliance on news and sports, which lend themselves to live viewing, will continue to support pricing for Fox ad revenue, though declining paid-TV subscriptions should continue to limit the ad revenue upside from television broadcasts. Similar dynamics affected affiliate fees in the quarter, though strong pricing on subscription renewals more than offset subscriber declines. More importantly, the firm remains in a strong negotiating position with distributors. Management said it had one third of its renewals coming due this fiscal year, and it has come to agreement on virtually all of them without going off the air during negotiations. With its ownership of Fox News, which continues to lead among cable news network viewership, and several sports properties, notably the NFL and college football, we believe the firm will remain well positioned to expand affiliate revenue through pricing power. Margins were under pressure during the quarter, with the adjusted EBITDA margin contracting to 27% from 34% last year. Higher sports programming rights and production costs were responsible for the pressure, and we anticipate these higher costs will be ongoing issues.","Fox News remains the king of the cable news hill and the firm can leverage its strong ratings and audience loyalty to grow affiliate fees. Fox owns one of four major national broadcast networks that are the only television outlets capable of reaching almost all 130 million households in the U.S. Between Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox network, Fox can offer content that appeals to almost any viewer, making the firms channel bundle must-have content for almost all pay television distributors.","Critics of Fox News and of specific hosts have led multiple boycotts of advertisers. Some of these boycotts have been very successful in causing larger corporations to cancel their advertising on the channel and specific shows. Some of these advertisers have not returned. Fox is the only one of the four major broadcasters without a significant affiliated production studio. The firm will be squeezed by outside studios that will pass through increased production costs. Fox overpaid when it renewed its NFL rights in 2021, which may depress margins through 2033, when the deal expires.",09/10/2023,"After selling its film, television studios, and various other entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, Fox now consists exclusively of the Fox network, 28 local TV stations, Fox News Group, Fox Sports, Tubi, and investments in related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The slimmer firm represents a large bet on the viability of live sports and news, as we project that the cable networks, including Fox News and FS1, will generate the vast majority of operating income. We believe these bets are well placed, but Fox is now undiversified relative to other media firms. Fox News has been the top cable news network for over 20 years, exhibiting similar strength through both Republican and Democratic U.S. presidential administrations. Despite the loss of founding CEO Roger Ailes in 2017, the network has continued to rank number one in cable network across all age groups in both prime-time and daytime. As the dominant television source for viewers seeking a Republican viewpoint, we expect the network to retain its spot at the top of the cable news pyramid, allowing Fox to increase the affiliate fees while maintaining carriage at both traditional and online pay-TV distributors. Foxs attempt to beat ESPN, FS1, has not yet reached and may never meet that lofty target, but the network has established itself as a competitor in the cable sports wars. FS1 owns the rights to several sports, including MLB, college sports, and soccer. While we expect Fox to continue acquiring rights, we believe the channel faces an uphill struggle against a much larger competitor in ESPN and newer rivals like Amazon, especially as the media landscape evolves toward streaming. While the Fox broadcast network still owns major sports rights, including the NFL, Fox is now the only one of the four major broadcasters without an affiliated full-scale production studio. We believe Fox can source new shows from other studios, including independents such as Lionsgate. However, we are more skeptical than management that Fox will be able to obtain ownership rights to every new show, given the high demand for new shows from traditional and streaming outlets.  ","We assign Fox a narrow moat rating based on the intangibles moat source. One of our guiding premises in media is that the value of content continues to increase even as the distribution markets mutate. Despite changes in distribution, pay television penetration remains above 50% of roughly 130 million U.S. households. Even without a pay television subscription, many cord-cutters still consume video content and manyNielsen estimates around 18 million householdsuse antennas to capture signals, providing content creators with an additional avenue to generate revenue from these viewers. Given the ongoing demand for content, we believe content creation is not a zero-sum game, as high-quality content will always find an outlet.The sale of Twenty First Century Foxs entertainment assets to Disney has created a unique media firm in Fox. The firm is now heavily focused on live events, notably news and sports, through Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, and Big Ten Network. Fox's competitive advantage lies in its national broadcast network and cable networks. We view Fox News as the crown jewel among the corporations assets. The news channel has leveraged its hold over Republican-leaning viewers to become the number one ranked cable network among all age groups for both the prime time and all-day time slots for the last seven years. Fox News benefited from the contentious atmosphere surrounding the Trump presidential administration and the widening political gap between the two parties. However, the channel has finished as the top cable news network for more than 20 years, spanning both Democratic and Republican U.S. presidential administrations. Management used these ratings to drive significant growth in the channels affiliate fees, which expanded from $0.58 per customer per month in 2009 to $1.72 in 2020 per SNL Kagan. We expect that the firm will continue to leverage strong ratings and audience loyalty to grow affiliate fees for Fox News faster than the average pay-TV channel. The company owns one of four major national broadcast networks and affiliated TV stations in 17 markets. While network ratings have declined over the past decade, broadcast networks are the only television outlet capable of reaching almost all households in the U.S. Network ratings still outpace cable ratings and provide advertisers with one of the only remaining methods for quickly reaching a large number of consumers in one place. This makes the broadcast networks key partners for sports leagues, as the channels provide access to the largest potential audience and can best monetize the rights. Fox has a strong portfolio of sports rights including NFL (Sunday afternoon), MLB, FIFA World Cup, college football, college basketball, and Nascar. The term for these rights varies from three to 10 years. While leagues are always looking for new partners, current holders do tend to hold on to the rights if interested in continuing the relationship. This is due in part to the invested infrastructure, the known quantity and quality of the relationship, branding, and the incumbents ability to monetize the rights without heavily investing in marketing. Among the firms other cable assets, we think that the Fox Sports networks, FS1 and FS2, have the largest opportunity to generate economic profits. We believe that the Murdoch family wanted to hold the channels to enhance its position when negotiating with both traditional and internet-based pay television distributors. The channels remain well behind ESPN in terms of total audience, but have made inroads as the firm has spent money on sports rights including MLB, college football, college basketball, and soccer. Similar to ESPN and ABC for Disney, we expect the FOX broadcast network and FS1 to continue to share talent and sports rights with the biggest games on Fox and other contests on FS1 and FS2. Fox does not own a major production studio, and management does not plan to build one. Instead, the broadcast network will be buying much of its general entertainment content from third-party studios. We expect that Fox will try to continue to work with more independent studios like Lionsgate or Sony Pictures and will look to finance some of its productions in order to retain syndication and streaming rightsmuch like Netflix did early on in its pivot toward original content. However, we think that the firm will find it difficult to compete in the increasingly tight market for talent within television production as it no longer owns platforms for edgier content, similar to the way its predecessor used FX and FXX (now part of Disney). While the Murdochs did turn Fox into a bet on the value of live sports and news, the strategy is also a bet on the continued viability of the pay television bundle. Due to its lack of a studio and the sale of its content library to Disney, the firm has little to no ability to compete in the subscription streaming marketplace. However, Fox does own Tubi, a free ad-supported streaming television, or FAST, service that is available in North and Central America, Australia, and New Zealand. While FAST platforms like Tubi have grown rapidly over the last five years, the space is getting more crowded and other media firms, such as Paramount with Pluto, own deeper content libraries that can be used to populate the service. Additionally, FAST platforms are facing competition for ad revenue from subscription services like Netflix and Disney+ that have lower priced ad-supported tiers. Between Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox network, Fox can offer content that appeals to almost any viewer, making the firms channel bundle must have content for most pay television distributors. We note that the firms channels are a key part of the bundle on every major online pay-television platform, including YouTube TV, Hulu, and Sling, a spot we expect that the networks will retain for the foreseeable future.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Fox is High. The new business models proliferating throughout the media sector could diminish Fox's revenue growth or profitability. Viewership of its programs could fall below expectations, and advertisers could pull back on their spending, both of which could drag on advertising sales growth. Without control of a production studio, Fox may struggle to respond to these trends. The Fox broadcast network is highly leveraged to sports content to draw viewers and maintain leverage with distributors. The cost of sports rights has continued to skyrocket, putting pressure on margins. Fox News is performing very well today, but advertisers could flee from the network due to boycotts or controversial commentary from on-air talent. The older viewer base could cap the ability of the network to grow ad revenue and hinder its ability in the future to replace advertisers if more buyers abandon Fox News or its hosts.Rupert Murdoch recently announced he was retiring from the board of Fox, but he still controls a large percentage of the voting power despite a much smaller economic interest in the company. Rupert's son, Lachlan Murdoch, will now serve as sole chairman and CEO. We believe that Rupert Murdoch will structure his estate to ensure his family remains in charge upon his passing. Still, whenever Rupert no longer has a voice in the firm's direction, it will remain to be seen whether Lachlan and potentially other beneficiaries will be able to steer the firm as well as the patriarch has.","We assign Fox a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, driven primarily by the likelihood that Fox adds value through investments but also accounting for the shape of its balance sheet and its shareholder distributions.While the firm increased its debt load during the pandemic, we view the balance sheet as sound. The firm ended June 2023 with about $3 billion in net debt,a very manageable amount for a firm that has generated about $1.5 billion or more free cash flow each year since 2019. We think that the firm would be willing to increase leverage to make large-scale acquisitions and that it has the ability to do so. The wisdom of any such move would depend on the details. The firm returned over $4 billion to shareholders each year since fiscal 2020. Fox bought back $2 billion shares in fiscal 2023 while a declining share count reduced the dividend payout to $299 million despite modestly increasing per-share amounts. While we viewed the shares as undervalued during much of this period, we think that Fox should be allocating more of its cash flow to investing in sports rights and rebuilding its content creation engines. Fox operates in a highly competitive landscape in which many of its peers have already transitioned to a direct-to-consumer focus or added a DTC offering like Disney+, Peacock (NBCUniversal), or Paramount+. While the firm does have Fox Nation, a DTC version of its popular news channel, the lack of studios or a content library (both of which were sold to Disney) constraints Foxs ability to create a compelling general-audience DTC service. Instead, Fox represents a large-scale bet on the value of sports and news. While this bet may pay off, the firm should be heavily investing in sports rights and its news operations in order to give the bet the best chance of succeeding. Fox currently has retained its critical Sunday afternoon NFL rights through 2033 but it lost its Thursday night games to Amazon for the 2022 season. The cable sports channels have lost the UEFA Champions and Europa League rights to CBS despite having rights to the next two World Cups. Fox was also outbid by NBC for the English Premier League rights in 2021. In 2021, ESPN added the NHL and renewed its NFL rights with ESPN+ gaining games from both leagues. The lack of a DTC platform and increased competition for rights may cause Fox to overbid for sports rights and thus affect margins. We also remain concerned about one-off and haphazard investments. At the predecessor company, management made a series of ill-fated acquisitions like Myspace, IGN, and Photobucket that were tangentially related to the core business. While some of the recent acquisitions like Tubi make sense, others like Credible Labs, a personal finance site, leave us scratching our heads.","Fox represents the assets not sold to Disney by predecessor firm, Twenty First Century Fox, in 2019. The remaining assets include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations of which 17 are affiliated with the Fox Network, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market. ","After increasing its debt load during fiscal 2021 and 2022, Fox reduced debt in 2023 and ended the fiscal year with less than $3 billion in net debt, a very manageable amount for a firm that has generated about $1.5 billion or more free cash flow each year since 2019. We expect that Fox will continue to pay a semiannual dividend, as it should have the ability to generate strong free cash flow. However, Fox could choose to reinvest cash flow into creating its own television production studio, like CBS did after its split from Viacom in 2006. We note that the investment into CBS Studios helped CBS to diversify away from its initial dependence on advertising revenue. The firm could also hoard the cash to help pay for the increased cost of sports rights, as it competes with much larger firms for these rights.",FOXA,Communication Services,14128436224.0,NMS,5336951.0,USD,30.36000061035156,True,1,31.314019775391763,29.9392864086,0
25/11/2023,Minimal Changes To Our Fair Value After Fiscal Q3 Earnings For Toronto Dominion,The Toronto-Dominion Bank,TD,4,,Eric Compton,83.15,CAD,23/11/2023,94.0,Low,Wide,Exemplary,A,,No Text Available,"The profitability of its Canadian bank segment should continue for some time, providing a solid foundation for strong returns for Toronto-Dominion. TD is one of the top issuers of cards in Canada, which tends to be a more profitable business if managed appropriately. The bank's recent acquisition of Cowen should provide a unique boost for its U.S. capital markets operations and for revenue and net income growth over the next several years.","The bank's higher U.S. exposure and higher rate sensitivity is turning into a double-edged sword, as higher rates are now putting more pressure on earnings, particularly within the U.S.   The Canadian housing market is heating up again, potentially increasing risks for the economy and the banking sector. Credit losses could rise in the future, and earnings growth is likely to be pressured for one or more years going forward. Toronto-Dominion will have to look outside Canada for additional growth opportunities, which could weigh on overall returns.",28/08/2023,"Toronto-Dominion is one of the two largest banks in Canada by assets and one of six that collectively hold roughly 90% of the nation's banking deposits. The bank derives approximately 55% of its revenue from Canada and 35% from the United States, with the rest from other countries. Toronto-Dominion has done an admirable job of focusing on its Canadian retail operations and growing into number-one or -two market share for most key products in this segment. The bank also has number-two market share for business banking in Canada. With over CAD 400 billion in Canadian assets under management and top-three dealer status in Canada, and being the number-one card issuer in Canada, Toronto-Dominion should remain one of the dominant Canadian banks for years to come. Toronto-Dominion has also established a significant presence in the U.S. by having the most branches in the U.S. among Canadian banks as well as a 12% ownership stake in Charles Schwab. While we like the higher exposure to more growth in the U.S., the segment has lower returns on equity than the Canadian segment, partially because of goodwill but also partially because returns are naturally lower on average. We also like Toronto-Dominions positioning as a major discount brokerage player because we believe this industry is ripe for growth as investors seek out lower-cost alternatives, and the bank could leverage its knowledge of the industry for future growth in Canada. The bank has taken a number of charges (such as integration charges, restructuring charges, and more). Many of these have been related to acquired card portfolios. We expect that as these card relationships mature, the bank should be well positioned in what is a higher-return business. TD will no longer acquire First Horizon. We did not feel the deal added any value, so this development does not impact our view of the bank. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Cowen was recently closed. Expect fairly messy earnings (lots of one-time items) for the next year, and we also would not be surprised if the bank sees some fallout related to recent regulatory inquiries into the bank's AML/BSA compliance. We expect midteens returns on equity through the cycle.","With its solid funding base, leading share in the Canadian banking market, moaty nonbank businesses, and the ability to primarily operate in the favorable Canadian banking environment, we believe Toronto-Dominion deserves a wide Morningstar economic moat rating.We argue that bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. We see switching costs in the Canadian system being driven by a tightly regulated oligopolistic market structure, which limits excess competition and stabilizes product pricing, giving customers less incentive to switch banks. Cost advantages stem from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting, with regulatory costs a final factor that must also be considered. We think the Canadian banking environment offers systemic cost advantages for the banks under its domain. These advantages manifest in the form of lower operating costs, lower credit costs, lower regulatory costs, and lower absolute levels of and better diversification of risks, all of which allow the banks to achieve greater risk-adjusted returns.In our view, Toronto-Dominion has a wide moat because it has superior market share in the advantageous Canadian banking environment, a better deposit mix, and exposures to moaty nonbank businesses. Toronto-Dominion has consistently had one of the lower percentages of wholesale funding among the major Canadian banks. This has kept funding costs low, leading to consistently better net interest margins, even as credit costs remained well in line with the other Canadian banks. Extra yield from its credit card portfolio has helped as well. Toronto-Dominion is one of the two largest banks in Canada (along with Royal Bank of Canada) and has dominant market share in many categories, including number-one or -two share in all key retail banking products. Toronto-Dominion is also one of the dominant investment banks in Canada. Once you reach the scale and reputation required to source and execute deals, offerings, and advice that Toronto-Dominion has, we believe the investment banking business becomes more moaty. The bank also has a significant ownership stake in Charles Schwab (formerly in TD Ameritrade), a wide-moat-rated brokerage and investment firm operating out of the U.S., and the third-largest amount of assets under management among the Canadian banks. U.S. retail operations are also strong, earning 13%-15% returns on tangible common equity, with number-one deposit market share in its largest metro area. We believe all of these operations combined warrant a wide moat rating.We believe the Canadian banking environment offers systemic cost advantages, which lead to returns above the cost of capital, allowing the main banks operating under its jurisdiction to possess moats. Barriers to entry are very high in the Canadian banking system. Regulations prevent foreign competition, as non-Canadian residents may not own more than 25% of the shares of a bank unless approved by the government (preventing foreign takeover), and foreign banks can operate in Canada only under certain restrictions (preventing significant direct foreign competition). Domestic competition is also controlled, as Canadas banking system historically developed to favor a few large banks controlling the majority of the domestic market, and this is actively enforced through the handling of chartering by the federal government exclusively. Additionally, the rejection of merger proposals in 1998 between Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, and between Toronto-Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, created a precedent for regulators accepting no further consolidation.Having larger banks helps spread fixed costs across a larger operating base, increasing operating efficiency, as the four largest Canadian banks are all bigger than the largest U.S. regional bank. The Canadian banks, because their branch networks spread throughout Canada, arguably have some of the countrys most powerful distribution networks. This offers cost advantages via lower customer acquisition costs. In addition, the banks are involved in nearly every major financial product, including asset management, wealth management, insurance, investment banking, and a variety of other consumer and commercial banking products and services. Bigger scale, powerful distribution networks, a multitude of products, and diversification of business lines lead to economies of scope in addition to the economies of scale already achieved.We believe a more protective and efficient regulatory system also leads to cost advantages, primarily through risk reduction. Less fragmented and well-integrated banking systems, like the Canadian system, tend to be more stable, reducing risk. Also, Canadian regulators must monitor and develop relationships with only the big six Canadian banks, which is much easier than trying to monitor the thousands of banks in the U.S., for example. This leads to more collaboration and cooperation between regulators and banks, as well as greater institutional memory and more coordinated and easily implemented responses if strains begin to appear in the system. Regulators help control pricing in the market at times, such as on mortgage products, helping reduce the potential for pricing wars to gain market share at the expense of underwriting standards. Canadian regulation also makes it more difficult for bad credit to be issued, including mandatory insurance and standards on riskier mortgage loans, not having a government-sponsored enterprise, like a government-subsidized mortgage securitization market, and forcing banks to hold more of the risk on their own balance sheets. These factors help contribute to better absolute risk reduction in the system, as well as regulatory economies of scale.The Canadian banks are more geographically diversified on average than, for example, most U.S. regional banks, which often have concentrations in individual states or local economies. This diversifies credit risk, lowering the overall risk for each individual bank. Canadas system of higher taxes, more social safety nets, and undoubtedly other complex factors have also led to a more robust and stable middle class, which contributes to economic and political stability, further reducing systemic risk.Combine all of these factors, along with explicit government subsidies on deposit insurance and mortgage insurance, as well as the implicit subsidy of being too big to fail domestically (all big six Canadian banks are labeled as domestic systemically important banks), and we believe excess returns for banks are almost certain within Canada.","Canadian banks face two primary risks: macroeconomic risks and risks related to future acquisitions. Canada has some of the highest median housing prices/annual median household income ratios in several of its major housing markets, and mortgage debt levels have consistently increased for more than a decade. While low interest rates have kept debt servicing ratios under control, this puts the economy in a riskier position as rates rise. We also see the leverage of Canadian consumers as a risk, because consumers have slowly leveraged up for more than a decade. Toronto Dominion has one of the smaller exposures to the domestic real estate market in Canada, and we view this as a manageable risk for the bank.While there are uncertainties related to consumer debt levels and the mortgage market, we view them as a threat to future growth and not an existential risk to the Canadian banking system. Further, the Canadian banking system has historically been one of the more stable systems in the world, and is designed to protect industry profit levels and promote economic stability. As such, we assign our Canadian banks a Low Uncertainty Rating. We admit, with the rising mortgage risks, the banks are closer to Medium today than they were previously.From an ESG perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors which can come under more scrutiny at times. Commercials banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint and governance practices are in line with most companies.","We give Toronto-Dominion an Exemplary capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are exemplary, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. TD is well capitalized, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio consistenty above the 11% minimum. We view the company's capital investments as exemplary, as the bank has avoided value-destroying products and expansions while pursuing sensible investments and growth opportunities, allowing it to build up one of the most highly profitable Canadian banking franchises. We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate; it is largely in line with peers', with a healthy focus on a dividend and some additional earnings left over for repurchases after internal investments.Bharat Masrani, who has been with Toronto-Dominion since 1987, stepped in as CEO in November 2014. Before this, he had served in many roles, including COO, group head of the U.S. personal and commercial banking segment, and chief risk officer of TD Bank Group. Masrani was also president of Toronto-Dominions U.S. banking operations during the financial crisis and was prepped for the job for years under previous CEO Ed Clark.Toronto-Dominion has generally had one of the more conservative credit reputations among Canadian banks, and the bank performed well during the crisis, allowing it to expand its smaller commercial operations in the years afterward. Toronto-Dominion remains a primarily retail-focused bank, and we have been impressed by its share gains in its domestic markets over the past decade. Steady market share gains stemming from being one of the best-run domestic banks have led to consistent returns on equity and some of the best historical growth in tangible book value. The bank's more recent focus on gaining share in the commercial and wholesale spaces has also borne some fruit.While the Canadian operations have progressed well, Toronto-Dominion spent a lot of resources on large acquisitions in the U.S. (Banknorth in 2007 and Commerce Bancorp in 2008), and the U.S. retail segment had operated at roughly break-even returns on equity for years, if one assumes a 9% cost of equity for the business. However, after tax reform, the ROEs for this segment are now consistently in the low teens. Overall, Toronto-Dominion has done better than some peers in the U.S. and operates an attractive banking franchise throughout the Northeast. Based on performance of the bank's card portfolios, we think the bank has been able to manage the portfolios well while solidifying its top share position. The bank has also recently expanded its Canadian home equity line of credit portfolio aggressively; we think this area bears watching, as these types of lines seem further out on the risk curve. We viewed the bank's planned acquisition of First Horizon as fully priced, adding no value, therefore the fact that this acquisition will no longer happen may be a blessing in disguise, particularly as the U.S. banking industry faces even more headwinds for the time being.Overall, we like Toronto-Dominions history of conservatism and total returns for shareholders over multiple periods have consistently been within the top half of the big six.","Toronto-Dominion is one of Canada's two largest banks and operates three business segments: Canadian retail banking, U.S. retail banking, and wholesale banking. The banks U.S. operations span from Maine to Florida, with a strong presence in the Northeast. It also has a 13% ownership stake in Charles Schwab.","We think Toronto-Dominion is in strong overall financial health. Toronto-Dominion has generally been a lower-risk, more retail-focused bank with a strong internal credit culture, which should bode well for its financial health. However, given how leveraged the Canadian consumer appears to be, we expect that loan demand may wane if a prolonged downturn occurs. We are also concerned about a potential deflation of the housing market in Canada and the impact on Canadian banks, although we view this more as a growth concern rather than a credit or capital concern. Toronto-Dominion has one of the smaller exposures to uninsured mortgages among the big six banks, which should help it relative to peers. We think Toronto-Dominions reported common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.2% as of July 2023 is more than satisfactory. With the bank's previously planned acquisition of First Horizon now no longer occuring, this should give the bank plenty of excess capital to pursue share repurchases and organic expansion efforts. The latest update from the bank on these efforts is that the bank expects to repurchase roughly 16 million shares by the end of September, with authorization to repurchase up to 90 million additional shares, or 5% of remaining shares outstanding. Expansion efforts in the southeastern U.S. should also remain a focus. The bank maintains one of the highest credit ratings (along with Royal Bank of Canada) of the big six banks. We forecast that the dividend payout ratio will generally stay within a normalized level in the mid- to upper-40s.",TD.TO,Financial Services,146677874688.0,TOR,4963474.0,CAD,83.36000061035156,True,1,80.22715123494524,80.58104761635366,0
25/11/2023,"Industry Headwinds Affect Everyone, but Darden's Prudent Pricing Should Stabilize Firm's Results",Darden Restaurants Inc,DRI,3,05/10/2023,Sean Dunlop,156.01,USD,24/11/2023,146.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,05/10/2023,"The restaurant industry looks cheap to us for the first time since fall 2022, with the recent market correction creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Our coverage trades at a 7% cap-weighted discount to our intrinsic valuations, with wide-moat companies like Yum Brands, Starbucks, and McDonald's looking unusually alluring, each trading at a 10%-12% discount to our respective $139, $103, and $285 fair value estimates. We recognize that slowing same-store sales pose a near-term risk, but believe that large, quick-service operators with scale-driven cost advantages and strong digital touchpoints look poised to capture market share in this dynamic environment. Restaurants are more resilient than many investors realize, with companies that outperform on the basis of ""value for the money"" like McDonald's and wide-moat Chipotle even posting comparable-store sales growth over the course of the 2007-09 downturn. While we expect consumer spending to slow in 2024, we continue to maintain that the U.S. will avoid an outright recession and believe that investors seeking consumer cyclical exposure would do well to consider turning toward the restaurant industry at current prices. More concretely, comparable store sales growth over the most recent quarter slowed to a 5.5% annualized clip since 2019 (prepandemic) across our U.S. restaurant coverage, comfortably ahead of historical averages but representing a meaningful step-down from the 6.8% result a quarter ago. Traffic has declined industrywide for the past 16 months (Revenue Management Solutions) and an increasingly price-sensitive customer will likely drive an uptick in industry promotional activity. While we acknowledge market concerns regarding operators' ability to drive incremental price increases ahead of inflation in the current environment, we believe that disinflationary (and in some cases deflationary) commodity costs and an easing labor market should defend margins.","Darden's strong restaurant margin recovery should defend its 2%-3% annual unit growth targets even as pressure builds elsewhere in the full-service restaurant industry. Sticky off-premises sales could increase throughput capacity at mature concepts (Olive Garden, LongHorn) that were approaching dine-in limits. Darden's COVID-19-induced cost savings look sticky, widening the profitability gap between the operator and its full service restaurant peers.","Slower full-service industry growth could result in aggressive discounting and challenges generating positive traffic in the intermediate term. Limited-service restaurant competition in suburban trade areas could drive sales transfers, with those operators increasingly seeking to move closer to customers. With new units costing anywhere from $3 million to $8 million at midpoint estimates, misgauging demographics, competition, or the allure of nearby attractions could prove costly.",27/09/2023,"Darden Restaurants' playbook strives to leverage its competitive advantages, with the restaurant operator leaning into its scale-driven cost edge, embracing datacentric decision-making, trying to attract and retain employees with compelling benefits and culture, and providing a differentiated dining experience, consistent with management's back-to-basics strategy. While we view this approach as strategically sound, we expect any success at Darden to come in spite of, rather than propelled by, aggregate industry results, with the full-service industry posting anemic average annual sales growth (1%-2%) over the past decade, well behind limited-service peers' 3%-4% clip.  In our view, scale has allowed Darden to flex its muscle through favorable procurement costs, efficiency-enabling operational investments like its to-go platform and Cheddar's point-of-sale and kitchen layout revamp, and judicious marketing support. While full-service competitors have seen restaurant-level margins fall well below figures from the early 2010s (to the low to mid-teens from the mid-20s), Darden has been able to launch a value-oriented menu and generate margin through transaction volume, underpinning consolidated restaurant margins around 20%.  A value-oriented menu figures to be disproportionately important in the near term, with consumers seeking out relative value against a tough inflationary backdrop. Darden's cautious approach to pricing, consistently raising menu prices at rates below inflation, reflects lessons learned from the firm's experience in the aftermath of 2007-09, when aggressive price increases drove declining traffic and ultimately an intercession by activist investor Starboard Value. With consumers visiting full-service restaurants only a few times per year, outpricing the core customer doesn't become immediately apparent, justifying such conservatism. We think the firm's success will be dictated by its ability to cater to younger consumers, with strategic menu innovation, the convenience value proposition, and compelling value for the money continuing to feature heavily in purchase decisions.","The U.S. restaurant industry is intensely competitive, with creative destruction and often irrational promotional activity rendering it difficult for operators to carve out an economic moat. Those that do so, in our view, have often developed a brand intangible asset that conveys trust, drives traffic, and imparts pricing power, or they otherwise benefit from a scale-driven cost advantage. In practice, these moat sources often arise in tandem, with a strong brand allowing restaurant chains to quickly develop new units, expand beyond regional or national borders, and generate leverage over procurement costs, general and administrative expenditures, and investments in the brand through regional or nationwide marketing. Absent the hallmarks of traditional intangible asset-driven moats, including robust comparable sales performance, international concept replication, or relative strength during periods of economic stress, we maintain our prior view that an intangible asset moat source is inappropriate for Darden. However, we do believe the firms procurement scale and leverage over advertising, technological, and administrative expenditures offer a durable cost advantage over peers. Our rating suggests that Darden is able to retain efficiency gains (in both general and administrative expenditures and hourly labor) that have materialized over the last three to five years as it flexes its national scale in procurement, benefits from lower last-mile delivery costs associated with larger drop sizes, and diffuses necessary marketing and technology costs across a larger base of system sales. Our 10-year average return on invested capital forecast of 16% (inclusive of goodwill) embodies this stance, outpacing our cost of capital estimate of 8.8%.In our view, Dardens brand cachet has been diminished by competition from younger, more technologically adept upstarts (particularly fast-casual restaurants, whose rapid ascendency in the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession permanently altered the trajectory of the industry), while consumer demands for convenience, accentuated by on-demand omnichannel ordering capabilities pulled forward by COVID-19 investments, appear likely to diminish the everyday dine-in experience for the foreseeable future. The U.S. casual dining industry remains under intense pressure, with a declining core demographic, overindexation to struggling suburban shopping centers, and the ascendance of convenience-oriented concepts stymieing industry growth in the aftermath of the Great Recession (with Darden seeing flat or negative comparable sales growth in five of seven years between 2008-14). While Darden is perhaps the best operator in the space and has astutely evolved its menu to better cater to both lower-income and higher-income clientele through barbell menu options and the acquisition of upscale concepts like The Capital Grille, sluggish industry growth would suggest that Dardens expansion aspirations will increasingly come at the expense of category peers, with a stagnating subindustry threatening to blunt pricing power and underpin an increasingly promotional environment. Nonetheless, we believe that Dardens scale-driven cost advantage is enduring, while recognizing the company finds itself on the wrong side of demographic trends, with younger millennials and Gen Z customers toward whom the category has historically underindexed continuing to increase their share of aggregate restaurant spending.Were impressed by managements actions since the nadir of the post-Great-Recession-driven industry crisis, with the firm continuing to generate leverage through technological adoption in the supply chain, streamline restaurant operations, and generate efficiencies in restaurant support and services. While these benefits can be difficult to definitively trace, a couple of factors suggest value in managing a portfolio of smaller restaurants (to the extent that their operations dont distract management from more important brands in the portfolio)including $20 million-$25 million in general and administrative expense savings at Cheddars following its 2017 acquisition, or 3.8% of 2018 segment sales, and 320 basis points of restaurant margin improvement in the other businesses segment during 2021, despite a pandemic-driven mid-single-digit decline in same-store sales. The latter benefit was driven by investments in kitchen layouts at Cheddars, the adoption of an off-premises channel, and a unified point-of-sale system, offering customer ordering data that had previously been inaccessible and representing investments that are difficult for smaller chains to swallow. Even as management has targeted 10-30 basis points of annual operating margin improvement since the firms 2014 turnaround, median comparable sales growth has meaningfully recovered (to 2.4% for 2015-23 from negative 0.5% for 2008-14), alleviating concerns that cost savings are coming at the expense of investments in the brands or the firms competitive standing. Dardens portfolio appears to have emerged from the pandemic stronger than before, with sales leverage, menu rationalization, a meaningfully larger off-premises business, and marketing efficiencies underpinning stronger operating margins and defending high-teens to low-20s restaurant margins despite an extremely challenging inflationary backdrop in fiscal 2022 and 2023.Further, we believe that Darden benefits from a scale-driven advantage in food procurement costs, attributable to its scale as the tenth-largest chain restaurant company in the United States in 2022 (per Euromonitor data and our estimates), as well as lower delivery costs, with larger drop sizes at restaurants offering leverage over expensive last-mile delivery. Of the 25 largest full-service restaurant operators in the U.S. in 2022, Darden posted the fourth-highest unit volume and generally sees consolidated average unit volume clock in around 5 times higher than the full-service industry average (our calculations, Euromonitor data). By our estimates, the firm's per-unit food cost outpaces total sales at many quick-service restaurants (clocking in at $1.75 million in fiscal 2023), allowing Darden to generate substantial leverage over last-mile delivery costs, with larger drop sizes helping blunt the impact of the most expensive component of the delivery value chain.We see the evidence of Dardens cost advantage manifest in three key data points.First, the materially lower operating margins at U.S. food distributors for chain restaurant segments (with narrow-moat Sysco reporting operating margins about 6-7 percentage points lower in its chain restaurant business than for aggregate U.S. food service), which points to bargaining power and a reduced dependence on distributors for auxiliary services.Second, through a strong edge in restaurant margins, general and administrative expenses, and operating margin relative to publicly traded peers, which already tend to outperform independent concepts. Dardens restaurant-level margins clocked in just shy of 19% across its portfolio in fiscal 2023 despite inflationary pressure, healthily outpacing peers like Brinker (11.2%), Cheesecake Factory (12.1%), and even Texas Roadhouse (15.2%). With restaurant margins accounting for differences in cost of food goods, paper products, labor, rent, utilities, and marketing expenditures, we view them as a useful if insufficient proxy for a cost edge over peers, discouraging price competition and irrational discounting, as Darden represents the low-cost operator in the space. Further, Dardens G&A expenditures, clocking in at 3.7% of fiscal 2023 system sales, clock in level with Brinker (Chilis, Maggianos), 60 basis points better than Texas Roadhouse, and 250 basis points better than The Cheesecake Factory in those firms' most recent fiscal years, resulting in structurally higher operating margins. That gap appears to have widened as the industry emerges from the shadow of COVID-19, with Darden posting a meaningfully higher 11.4% operating margin in its most recent fiscal year, with many of its category peers clocking in in the single digits.Finally, while the lines in food service are blurring, with customers often frequenting restaurants across the spectrum from fast food to fine dining, full-service concepts generally compete for a slightly different customer occasion than do fast casual and fast food. Disproportionate independent restaurant representation (with independents generating roughly 60% of full-service sales, compared with 25% of limited-service sales in the U.S., per Euromonitor), low industry concentration, and consumer preference for trying different concepts would suggest that the appropriate competitive set is all full-service restaurants (or perhaps all restaurants), rather than just the largest chains, supporting our cost advantage argument.We view a narrow (not wide) moat rating as appropriate, with comparable sales falling below inflation across brands by our terminal-year forecasts and recognizing that natural limits prevent Darden from squeezing G&A operating leverage out of the system ad infinitum. While we expect the firm to maintain many of its recent operating margin gains, we foresee only modest incremental leverage as we consider low-single-digit comparable store sales growth and a partial return of marketing expenditures. Meaningful price competition or slower-than-expected growth could drive further deleverage, particularly if Darden is forced to lean more heavily into discounts or marketing to drive traffic moving forward, reducing our confidence in excess returns through the 20-year horizon implied by a wide moat rating.","We assign Darden Restaurants a Medium Uncertainty Rating, consistent with our quantitative methodology. While Darden has managed to grow in spite of a difficult industry backdrop, we expect full-service restauranteurs to continue to struggle to generate traffic, as consumers continue to trade up (fine dining) for special occasions, and down for everyday meals (fast-casual or upscale QSR concepts), impinging on casual dining's pricing power and competitive niche.While Darden's casual dining restaurants are often the low-cost operators in their respective spaces, higher relative price points in the full-service dining space increase the industry's sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, with price-elastic customers trading down to cheaper fast casual and fast food options during periods of economic stress, driving moderate top-line volatility. Further, Darden's company-operated footprint generates higher fixed costs (operating leases, debt service) than many heavily franchised competitors, increasing the sales sensitivity of the firm's operating income, while recently volatile input cost inflation further heightens cash flow uncertainty. Further, the threat of irrational promotional activity or excessive discounting remains in the background, with lackluster industry growth espousing competition as firms fight for incremental market share.We view environmental, social, and governance risks as minimal for Darden, with human capital management representing the largest uncertainty. Darden has been proactive with its ESG investments, helping alleviate ESG concerns in the supply chain.","We assign Darden Restaurants a Standard capital allocation rating, with a strong balance sheet, mixed acquisition record, and neutral take on shareholder returns informing our view.Darden's balance sheet appears robust, with modest net debt, strong free cash flow to sales (averaging 9%-10% of sales through 2028), and less than one turn debt/adjusted EBITDA underpinning our rating. Darden continues to target an investment-grade credit rating, which our leverage forecast should permit, while access to a $1 billion credit line, no meaningful principal maturities until 2027, and $192 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 leave us confident that balance sheet health will not constrain the firm's investment aspirations or operations.We believe that management's investment strategy will be neutral, with a mixed historical record and stable returns on invested capital leaving us comfortable with the assertion that near-term investments are unlikely to materially create or destroy economic value. The acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million in 2017 represents perhaps the biggest question mark, with anemic comparable sales growth since 2017 and slow organic unit growth (roughly 3%) a far cry from the 12%-15% growth seen in the brand during the 10 years before its acquisition. Management booked $390 million in impairment charges against the segment in fiscal 2020 (split between trademarks and goodwill), and continues to struggle to drive an inflection point in unit development in that banner, conceded that the macroeconomic environment has been anything but amenable to a turnaround in the interim. At 10.4 times trailing EBITDA, the deal appeared fairly priced, with similar-size deals consummated between 10.6 times (Qdoba) and 15.7 times (California Pizza Kitchen).More recently, the firm's Ruth's Hospitality Group acquisition begs some questions, with the firm already boasting a steak brand (Longhorn) and what appear to be competitors in Capital Grille and Eddie V's within its existing portfolio. While the upscale steak chain purportedly caters to a different, predominately suburban, customer, the move still strikes us as a curious strategic fit despite a fair acquisition price (9.4 times EBITDA), and competitive unit economics, particularly since Ruth's has struggled to generate unit growth over the past handful of years. We believe that management should realize its intended cost synergies but view the transaction as value neutral for Darden shareholders. Moving down the income statement, we appreciate management's recent operational investment record, with 2%-3% of sales generally allocated to maintenance capital expenditures, inclusive of store remodeling and technology, both of which will be necessary to drive guest traffic and remain relevant to customers, especially as category peers (The Cheesecake Factory, Dine Brands, Brinker, and Texas Roadhouse) are forced by tighter operating margins to practice frugality. Our calculations see cash-on-cash returns at all units exceeding their respective costs of capital, even after considering corporate-level expenses (G&A and D&A expenditures), indicating that new unit expansion continues to remain an attractive use of capital, to the extent that new restaurants don't cannibalize sales from existing stores.While we understand the strategic rationale behind Darden's acquisition of smaller brands (eliminate roughly 4% of the cost base through G&A rationalization, access an underpenetrated vertical, drive the growth narrative, acquire value-oriented concepts), we expect that there may be a paucity of new investments that meet value-accretive criteria sufficient size to move the financial needle, attractive growth profile, underpenetrated vertical, structural inefficiencies that Darden could address, and alluring price. As a result, we haven't layered acquisitions into our forecasts, and we expect investments to be channeled toward elevating the customer experience and clinging to guest traffic as consumer preferences favor polished casual and fine dining restaurants for occasions and fast-casual or fast-food establishments for most everyday meals.Finally, our methodology considers shareholder returns, which we consider as mixed. While the amount of Darden's shareholder returns appears prudent, we view repurchases at prices that exceed our fair value estimate as dilutive, which has proven the case quite frequently over the past few years. We expect Darden to maintain a mid-60s long-term dividend payout ratio, with our forecast calling for $5.3 billion in shareholder returns over the next five years, split between share buybacks ($1.6 billion) and dividends ($3.7 billion).","Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the U.S. full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $10.5 billion in fiscal 2023 resulting in 3%-4% full-service market share (per NRA data and our calculations). The company maintains a portfolio of 10 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddars Scratch Kitchen, Ruth's Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie Vs, Bahama Breeze, and The Capital Burger. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales through the traditional grocery channel contribute modestly. As of the end of its fiscal 2023, the company operated 1,914 restaurants in the U.S.","We assess Darden's financial strength as sound, with the firm's access to credit during the nadir of the pandemic (especially as financial institutions were loath to lend to the troubled industry), healthy coverage of fixed costs, and minimal near-term principal obligations informing our opinion.Darden targets an investment-grade credit rating, generally consistent with 2-3 times lease-adjusted debt/EBITDAR. Our model calls for the company to stay comfortably within this range through 2033, allowing management relatively unencumbered access to capital as it invests in new unit openings, restaurant remodels, and technology. In our view, Darden's free cash flow and current capital structure should be more than sufficient to meet management's 2%-3% unit growth target, with free cash flow to the firm clocking in at an average annual rate of 9%-10% of sales through 2028, by our forecasts.With $192 million in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and $1.6 billion in debt, Darden remains in a small net debt balance, but projected 2024 EBITDA net interest coverage of 14 times and just 0.9 times debt/2024 EBITDA suggest that the firm should be able to comfortably meet its obligations, in our view. The company has access to a $1 billion credit facility, further dampening its credit risk.",DRI,Consumer Cyclical,19239571456.0,NYQ,800347.0,USD,156.00999450683594,True,0,147.33621664608353,162.70161642679267,1
24/11/2023,Group 1 Has Improved Its Used-Vehicle Capabilities While Maintaining Operational Flexibility,Group 1 Automotive Inc,GPI,3,17/11/2023,David Whiston,280.0,USD,23/11/2023,275.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,17/11/2023,"At the Los Angeles auto show on Nov. 16, Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon in which, starting next year, some of its dealers will sell new vehicles on Amazon.com. The news sent each of the six franchise dealers and CarMax down about 5%-8%, which we think is a large overreaction predicated on fears of Amazon taking share away from dealers. Such a risk is not even possible on new vehicle sales due to state franchise laws, nor do we think it is likely that Amazon wants to do all aspects of auto retailing such as handling and disposing of trade-ins, service, and finance and insurance offerings. Service is a very underappreciated benefit that dealers provide customers when comparing the traditional auto industry to digital retailing and electric vehicle startups' direct sales formats. Should Amazon directly sell used vehicles someday, CarMax would have more competition, but it also has the ability to sell via brick-and-mortar, digital-only, or any combination of both depending on what the customer wants, something a digital-only retailer cannot offer. Our auto coverage has been implementing omnichannel tools for years and we doubt that any of their management teams are surprised by the Amazon news. Details, especially around economics, are thin, but Automotive News cited a Hyundai spokesperson who said starting in January, only 18 Hyundai dealers will partner with Amazon, with that number expanding in the second half of the year. Prominent LA auto dealer Mike Sullivan joined Hyundai and Amazon in the presentation to say the dealer will still be the seller of record and reiterated other customer benefits that dealers provide like services. Its possible this arrangement is a larger version of Costcos auto program that provides members the ability to buy a new or used vehicle from over 3,000 dealers of various brands.","Auto dealerships are profitable businesses with a diversified stream of earnings beyond selling new vehicles. Parts and service revenue should continue to be lucrative over time because most manufacturers require warranty work to be done at the dealership, and large dealers can more easily afford the technology and training needed to service increasingly complex vehicles. Parts and service provide a large portion of gross profit, despite being a small part of overall revenue. If successful, AcceleRide and Val-U-Line could prove good future sources of profit.","Because publicly traded dealers command greater share in some markets, manufacturers may refuse to approve transfers of franchise rights at some dealerships, limiting acquisition-based growth. As category killer CarMax and online-only retailers grow, they have potential to take away some of the highly profitable used-car business. The company has had goodwill and fixed-asset impairment problems, and overpaying for acquisitions could pressure results in the future. Inflation damage could last for a long time too if the U.S. or U.K. has a prolonged recession.",26/10/2023,"Group 1's restructurings and investment in technology for used-vehicle procurement have paid off. A common operating metric in the dealer sector is selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit; Group 1's ratio improved to 61.4% including rent expense in 2022 compared with 77.9% in 2007, and management expects it to remain below 70% thanks to permanently reducing headcount by 7% during the pandemic. The company in 2018 began transforming itself with its Val-U-Line used-vehicle strategy and scheduling accommodations for service technicians, which are improving employee retention and increasing technician headcount. Val-U-Line comes from Group 1 wisely, in our opinion, wanting to retail more used vehicles rather than send them off to auction, because the former is more profitable. Val-U-Line only sells high-mileage used vehicles. The AcceleRide omnichannel platform should keep the firm competitive with new entrants to the online used-vehicle market such as Carvana but is also for new vehicles, service, and buying vehicles from consumers. We think digital will enable much better SG&A leverage than the company has had in the past and eventually increase used-vehicle sales. Most growth will come via acquisition because Group 1's model is similar that of the other large dealerships, which have been consolidating stores. The industry is consolidating because smaller players cannot compete with the scale and cost savings achieved through roll-up acquisitions pursued by the largest dealers. The industry is still highly fragmented, so we do not anticipate Group 1 will have a problem finding desirable stores to buy. We expect most deals to be in the U.S. but U.K. expansion is possible. Parts and servicing was about 12% of 2022 revenue but made up 37% of gross profit. This significant contribution to profitability is less volatile than vehicle sales and mitigates some of the cyclical risk of the auto industry. Vehicles are becoming more complex to repair, which we think favors the dealer that can more easily invest in service. Financing also helps profits with 100% gross margin from commission.","We are maintaining our narrow moat rating for Group 1, as its size continues to generate economies of scale and working capital efficiencies and the service segment and its warranty work give the company an intangible advantage over garages. We think the dealer sector is the best business in the automotive supply chain. The public dealers can centralize back-office operations and generate far more volume than a small dealer, which brings scale. Dealers have no burdensome retiree expenses, and the large public dealers are not dependent on the health of one brand. The dealers enjoy mid- to high-single-digit gross margins on new vehicles and 100% gross margin on financing and insurance. We think that the best source of competitive advantage is the parts and service operations. Many customers bring their vehicle to the dealer for servicing because the vehicle is either under warranty or because the dealer is close to home and has the factory parts and expertise to service the vehicle. Once vehicle owners know a dealer, we think they are likely to keep going back to the dealer for service. The dealer knows the vehicle, and comparison-shopping for repair work is very time-consuming since the customer has to bring the vehicle to each shop to get a quote.These logistics create inelasticity of demand, which creates pricing power for the dealer and is a source of excellent profit in good times and bad. In fact, during a downturn in new vehicle sales, dealers generally report higher gross margins due to a favorable mix shift, but then report lower operating margins due to SG&A deleveraging. Excluding large impairment and restructuring charges, dealers can still report positive EBIT even in a severe recession. Although most dealerships are good businesses, we think the large publicly traded dealers are best positioned for growth going forward since these firms can be the most flexible in changing brand mix. Many small owners are choosing to exit or sell because they cannot get the scale on a variety of expenses compared with large dealer groups.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Group 1 is High. Because of its reliance on acquisitions, Group 1 risks overpaying for a dealership or taking on too much debt to finance new deals. It has a history of goodwill and fixed-asset impairments, so book value could decline if a large impairment is taken. California, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Texas made up 5.4%, 9.9%, 5.8%, and 37.2%, respectively, of Group 1's 2022 new-vehicle retail unit sales. The November 2021 deal to buy 28 mostly New England stores from Prime brings integration risk of a deal that size. Supply chains are always a risk especially from the war in Ukraine and the chip shortage, and inflation hurts consumers' purchasing power. The large Texas exposure could be an issue, with disasters such as hurricanes, which the firm experienced in 2017 with Hurricane Harvey, and low oil prices at times hurting the Texas and Oklahoma economies. The company also gets about 53% of its new-vehicle unit volume from Toyota, VW Group, and BMW with Toyota (including Lexus) the largest contributor at about 24% in 2022.We dont see any major environmental, social, or governance risks for Group 1, but societal risks such as a mass recall affecting new-vehicle inventory could be an issue. In that scenario, wed expect Group 1 to benefit from extra service work for recalled vehicles paid for by the automaker, thus mass recalls could actually be a net positive for a dealer. The rise of electric vehicles has created uncertainty around dealers lucrative service operations, but Group 1 has shown data that its EV customer service retention is better than for combustion customers. Also of note is even though EVs may decrease the frequency of service visits, the dollar amount of repairs can be significantly higher than a traditional vehicle due to expensive electronics for the battery, safety, and autonomous driving systems.","We award Group 1 a Standard Capital Allocation Rating focused on balance sheet health, investments, and shareholder distributions. We like how management moved aggressively in 2020 to improve the firms debt profile instead of being inactive due to uncertainty around the pandemic. The company redeemed two bonds totaling $850 million in principal due in 2022 and 2023. These 5% and 5.25% notes were replaced with just $550 million of 4% notes due in 2028 (later increased to $750 million to fund the Prime deal in November 2021), giving the company plenty of time to focus on things like investing in digital or making more acquisitions rather than worrying about the balance sheet. It also reduced annual interest by over $15 million. Liquidity remains healthy, in our view, at about $726 million at Sept. 30. Credit line availability is about $463 million and the line expires in March 2027. A new $250 million bridge loan was added to help fund the Prime deal in 2021, but rent-adjusted leverage of 1.9 times at the end of 2022 does not cause us any concern.Group 1 has consistently generated a modest economic profit, with return on invested capital in the low double digits, but ROIC slipped into the high single digits in 2017-18 (due to more SG&A as a percentage of revenue) before bouncing back to more than 11% in 2019, nearly 15% in 2020, over 20% in 2021, and 18% thanks to low inventory from the chip shortage enabling excellent, though we think not likely to last, pricing in new vehicles. We expect economic profit for nearly all years of our five-year explicit forecast period thanks to our expectation of COVID-19 leading to an acceleration in digital operations and much better SG&A leverage than in the past. We think the company is correctly not ignoring the move to digital by investing in its AcceleRide e-commerce platform for new and used vehicles. AcceleRide was rolled out to all U.S. dealers in 2019 and to U.K. stores in early 2021. In 2022, the platform's U.S. units sold rose by 56% from 2021 to 30,500 (11% of the firm's U.S. combined new- and used-vehicle units sold) and we expect more growth as more customers get comfortable shopping entirely or partially online for a vehicle and taking delivery somewhere other than the dealership. AcceleRide also is used for service appointments and for consumers to sell a used vehicle to Group 1 with payment received within one hour. This move to digital accelerated due to the 2020 pandemic, in our opinion, which enabled Group 1 to permanently reduce its overhead costs by a single-digit percentage. We think the decision to sell its Brazil stores in July 2022 was the right move for optimal capital allocation. A continued weakening of the real against the dollar and difficult Brazil acquisition rules made success there too difficult and not worth the time and money, in our opinion.Acquisitions are the first priority for capital allocation, but dividends and share repurchases are also part of the mix. Management acquired $3.4 billion of revenue for 2014-20 but did pause M&A during 2020 because of the pandemic. With the Prime deal in November 2021, 2021 was a robust acquisition year, with acquired annual revenue of $2.5 billion, or $2.3 billion net of store disposals. 2022 acquired annual revenue net of dispositions was $675 million. The company also has a history of goodwill and franchise impairments, which suggests overpaying to acquire dealerships. Related, we were glad to hear in July 2018 that management is putting more emphasis on divesting underperforming stores and vowing to be more focused on capital expenditure control. If sellers are asking too much, then management is happy to buy back its own stock. As of the end of 2022, the diluted share count is down by about 33% from the end of 2015. In 2022, management bought back 17.6% of outstanding stock alone and has repurchased 4% in the first nine months of 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization at Sept. 30 was $184.9 million following a $153.7 million buyback program increase announced on Aug. 2 to get the authorization up to $250 million. After stopping the dividend in 2020 due to the pandemic, the board resumed the dividend with an October 2020 announcement and has increased it many times since then, including a 20% increase for 2023 announced in February. We expect the dividend to remain and keep growing, but it could be suspended in a severe downturn, as in 2020.","Group 1 owns and operates 41 collision centers and 201 automotive dealerships in the U.S. and the U.K., offering 35 brands of automobiles altogether. About 150 of the stores are in the U.S. with locations mostly in metropolitan areas in 17 states in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and California. Texas alone contributed 37% of new-vehicle unit volume in 2022 and the U.K. about 19%. Texas, Oklahoma, and Massachusetts combined were about 53%. Revenue in 2022 totaled $16.2 billion. The company was founded in 1995 and is based in Houston.","In the third quarter of 2014, Group 1 retired all of its convertible bonds outstanding. The firm funded the convertible retirement with $550 million of new 5.00% senior unsecured notes due in June 2022. These 2022 notes were retired in September 2020 and replaced with $550 million of 4% notes due in 2028. The firm issued another $200 million of the 2028 notes in 2021 to help fund the Prime acquisition. Group 1 redeemed all $300 million of its 5.25% 2023 notes in April 2020 via cash on hand and credit line borrowing. At Sept. 30, Group 1 had about $726 million in liquidity from cash and capacity on its credit lines and no large debt due until 2027. Availability on credit lines excluding floorplan at the end of the third quarter was about $463 million. Group 1 reinstated its dividend in 2010 and had been repurchasing shares, but COVID-19 led to the suspension of the dividend and the end of buybacks. In October 2020, the company announced the resumption of the dividend, and lately has aggressively repurchased stock.In March 2022, Group 1 amended its credit facility to expire in March 2027. The $2 billion facility has $1.2 billion for U.S. inventory floorplan financing and another $800 million for working capital, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes. The credit facilities are secured by essentially all of the company's domestic personal property. The facilities also contain financial covenants including a fixed-charge coverage test and total leverage test. The total adjusted leverage covenant is less than 5.5 times and was 1.9 times at year-end 2022. The fixed-charge coverage covenant is greater than 1.20 times and was 5.6 times at the end of 2022. Group 1 had about $773 million of mortgage debt at Sept. 30 and owned 67% of its real estate, up from 36% in 2011.

Management indicated that it is pursuing asset-backed debt financing, similar to what Frontier Communications recently issued. In addition, management sees multiple opportunities to sell or possibly acquire assets. This discussion comes amid the backdrop of a CEO change at Windstream, by far Unitis largest customer. We expect Uniti will be able to navigate the capital markets and maintain a reasonably healthy Windstream relationship, and we are not changing our $12 fair value estimate. Revenue increased 3% year over year, with the fiber segment returning to growth. Movements in nonrecurring revenue, like installation and early termination fees, caused fiber revenue to decline last quarter. Management believes the same underlying trends continued during the quarter, with wireless carrier spending muted while demand around datacenters, fueled by AI investments, remains robust. The firm booked $710,000 of monthly recurring revenue during the quarter, which remains modestly weaker than the pace of new business wins during 2022. The firm still anticipates 5% growth in monthly recurring revenue during 2023. Windstream replaced long-time CEO Tony Thomas with Paul Sunu earlier this week. Sunu has a long history of leading telecom firms through mergers and buyouts, which could indicate Windstreams private-equity owners are looking for an exit. Building certainty around the Uniti master lease agreement would help facilitate a transaction. We like Windstreams aggressive network upgrade effort, but the Uniti relationship unnecessarily complicates the financial details. Fiber-to-the-home assets like those Windstream and Uniti are building are likely the most attractive to secured lenders, but borrowing against these networks likely isnt possible given the current situation.","Unitis renegotiation of its Windstream lease gives the ability to add new leases to existing fiber, which can be very lucrative, as it requires little new spending. Uniti's sale-leaseback transactions provide nearly 100% margins, require no spending or upkeep on Uniti's part, and lock in high-return revenue streams for 15 years or longer. There is less competition to provide fiber exists in the second- and third-tier cities where Uniti operates, and Unitis network will be in demand to facilitate ever-growing data transport needs.","Uniti is in a weak financial position, which at best impairs its ability to diversify its customer base and grow and at worst makes bankruptcy risk a constant threat. Competition for sale-leaseback transactionspotentially Uniti's biggest area of opportunitywould likely cause returns on prospective deals to drop below the firm's cost of capital. A depressed stock price limits Uniti's access to capital and can hamper growth and diversification, as it depends on equity issuance to fund those opportunities.",03/08/2023,"Unitis business is dominated by its triple-net leases, which results in little variability in operating results. The firms lease with Windstream makes up about 70% of total revenue and nearly 90% of EBITDA. Following Windstreams bankruptcy in 2019, Uniti and Windstream renegotiated the lease, which has an initial term that runs through 2030. The renegotiation leaves Uniti with very stable and predictable financial results, but the firm has sought to grow and diversify.  Unitis strategy to reduce its reliance on Windstream has been twofold: find more sale-leaseback transactions like the deal with Windstream that spawned the companywhere Uniti will buy a companys physical network assets and then lease it back to them with a triple-net lease at attractive and certain rates of returnand add additional customers to the fiber network assets the firm buys or builds.  We like Uniti's original leasing business, where it engages in the sale-leaseback transactions, but it has had difficulty implementing them. In recent years, a depressed stock price and high debt levels in the wake of Windstreams bankruptcy left the firm without financial flexibility to pursue these deals. However, we think a longer-lasting issue is an inability to find material deals like this. We don't think Uniti adds much value beyond providing capital, so we expect virtually any firm with access to cheap financing can compete. As such, we think suitors will compete on price, and finding sizable deals at attractive rates will be difficult.  With the dearth of sale-leaseback deals, diversification has come primarily via fiber construction and lease ups, where Uniti leases dark and lit fiber and small cells to wireless carriers and other enterprises. We think Uniti is well positioned here and has an advantage of operating mostly in second- and third-tier cities, where we don't think competition is quite as intense. However, the incremental leasing cant move the needle the way the purchase of a huge lease could, leaving us to expect Windstream will continue to dominate Unitis business and growth will be minimal.  ","Uniti has an interesting business and, in its very short life span, has generated good returns on invested capital (ROICs). However, we see few competitive advantages in its business model that gives it an edge over potential competitors and do not award the firm a moat. We estimate Uniti has averaged 9%-10% ROICs in the seven full years it has existed, similar to the cost of capital we estimate for the firm. Uniti's business is primarily premised on leasing fiber to its customers. Current returns stem almost entirely from its master lease agreement, or MLA, with Windstream, which provided more than 80% of total EBITDA in 2022. While the Windstream business alone may generate sustained excess returns and has significant switching costs, we agree that it was imperative for management to diversify and reduce customer concentration. In addition to pursuing sale-leaseback transactions with similar economics to its Windstream deal, management has acquired and built other fiber assets, which it has leased both to carriers and enterprises. Windstream went from making up 96% of revenue in 2015 to under 70% in 2022, and Uniti is striving to cut the share to 50%. However, with the diversification comes a bigger asset base that the firm needs to similarly prove it can earn excess returns on. This is where we think Uniti lacks a moat.Uniti's leasing segment encompasses the Windstream MLA and several relatively small sale-leaseback transactions enacted since 2018. We think these transactions are likely to lead to slim economic returns, and we see substantial switching costs associated with these deals. In each of those sale-leaseback deals, management has purchased the firms' entire network infrastructures, locked them into 15- to 20-year contracts at 9.3%-9.6% returns, and required the lessees to undertake 100% of spending and maintenance associated with the network. We think it is virtually inconceivable that tenants would voluntarily break these long-term contracts, as, in addition to legal ramifications, they would have to undertake significant spending to light a substitute network, if a comparable one even existed. Further, Uniti has carved out a portion of each network for its own proprietary use, and it will own all network improvements when the leases expire, provisions that should allow returns on these deals to comfortably exceed Unitis cost of capital.The biggest risk we see in the leasing segment is the potential that a tenant will be unable to uphold its end of the MLA. When Windstream went into bankruptcy, Uniti ultimately had to agree to a deal that effectively reduced its Windstream cash receipts by about 15% annually on top of making several other one-time cash and noncash considerations. With only slim excess returns existing already, such a scenario likely pushes ROICs below the weighted average cost of capital in the near term. Apart from renegotiation risks, we still don't believe Uniti's leasing business alone is enough to create a firmwide moatdespite the favorable economicsfor two reasons: 1) the bulk of the firms investment is in its fiber segment, potentially eroding the slim excess ROICs currently in the leasing business; and 2) the sale-leaseback business is a novel one that we think other firms could copy if they chose, so we are not convinced Uniti will continue to find future deals with initial yields in excess of 9%. Uniti believes it is the only firm really engaging in this type of fiber sale-leaseback business, and we think it could be attractive, so we would not be surprised to see others follow if Uniti proves successful. Management states that in the future the leasing business may compose the bulk of Uniti's incremental spending. When that happens, and if Uniti can continue locking in attractive deals, we think it could provide the basis of a moat. Until then, we think this segment is more likely to be a contributor to a moat only if other segments develop sufficient moat sources. We generally dont see competitive advantages in fiber ownership, so investment in the fiber segment does not support a moat. Broadly, our view is that fiber in the United States is commoditized and oversupplied (largely from irrational building in the 1990s), so firms holding it don't have competitive advantages despite the surge in demand, as many players can meet the need, and therefore lack of pricing power leads to lackluster returns. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Uniti is Very High. The resolution of the firms lease dispute with Windstream significantly eased our concerns about Uniti's ability to remain solvent, and its business is extraordinarily stable, considering master lease agreements with very predictable cash flows dominate it. However, a capital structure made up mostly of debt bring firmwide wide risk and makes the stock more volatile.Although we think Uniti will be able to meet its financial obligations unless disaster arises, its ability to fund growth is questionable. The Windstream agreement should provide a certain and stable stream of cash flow, but in the next few years Uniti will have additional cash payments it must send back to Windstream, which will strain liquidity. We don't think Uniti has much margin to avoid calamity if its business turns down or it faces another external shock. Our primary ESG concerns revolve around corporate governance and data security and privacy issues. Corporate governance has historically been questionable because of the way Uniti came into being, with a sale-leaseback transaction to buy Windstream's communications network and shield it from Windstream creditors. Appearance of impropriety was not helped by the familial relationship between Uniti and Windstream executives. However, Windstream already filed for bankruptcy and its lease with Uniti has already been litigated, so further risk stemming from the same issue should be less likely.Uniti has the same data security and privacy risk as other network providers because it transports high amounts of sensitive data. For each of these firms, a monumental breach is probably low, but if it were to happen, especially if due to company negligence, the financial and reputational damage could be severe.","We assign Uniti a Standard capital allocation rating. Our rating takes into account Unitis balance sheet and our outlook in regard to investment in the business and shareholder distributions. We think business investment is likely to be the critical factor in determining shareholder returns.In our view, Uniti has smartly pared its business in recent years so that it can now focus on leasing its fiber and engaging in sale-leaseback fiber transactions. Management has been able to secure favorable yields on its sale-leaseback transactionsalways above 9%so were confident that further investment in that unit will add value. As part of some deals, Uniti also ends up with fiber infrastructure that it can lease freely to other parties. With Unitis focus on its narrow, core competency, we believe the firms fiber network will get the attention and investment it needs and that Uniti will be able to avoid spending on projects that detract from the firms value, as we believed its towers segment did before Uniti sold it.Good intentions or ideas are likely to be held back by Unitis weak balance sheet, however. The firm has consistently maintained a net debt/EBITDA ratio of around 6.0, and debt accounts for about two thirds of Unitis enterprise value, so it has little flexibility to access cash when it needs it. After resolving its dispute with Windstream in 2020, we no longer think Uniti is in imminent danger of bankruptcy because of its reliable revenue stream, but an unforeseen hiccup could put it back on the brink. However, apart from Windstream, we dont think any single customers financial difficulties or attempts to break contracts could take down Uniti, as no other customer makes up a significant portion of revenue or cash flow. Uniti has about half of its total debt maturing by 2028. Given the firms weak financial position, we dont think its a formality for the firm to simply roll it over, and a continuation of a high interest rate environment could lead to burdensome terms.Unitis shareholder distribution policy is mixed, in our view. We think it maintained a dividend that was way too high for far too long, until it was essentially forced to cut it when its contract with Windstream was in limbo. Now, it pays a low dividend that simply meets the requirement to maintain its status as a REIT, which we think is appropriate, but were not confident that it will stick to that minimum. We think its likely to raise the dividend more than it must, and we think that will keep the firm on financially weaker footing. We dont expect any share repurchases, as we think any cash that the firm believes its able to return to shareholders will be through a dividend.","Uniti is a REIT with about 135,000 route miles of fiber in the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. Uniti reports its business in two segments: leasing and fiber. Leasing currently makes up about 75% of total revenue and consists mostly of Uniti's master lease agreement with Windstream. Uniti was spun out of Windstream in 2015 with a substantial portion of Windstream's network assets, and it immediately leased the entire portfolio back for Windstream's exclusive use. Other leasing revenue stems from sale-leaseback transactions with other fiber holders. Uniti generates fiber revenue by leasing dark and lit fiber to wireless carriers and other enterprises.","Uniti is a highly leveraged company in weak financial position, with net debt of 5.7 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2022 and a debt to capital ratio of over 100%. The resolution of the Windstream lease renegotiation significantly improved Unitis financial position, but it still carries risk, especially if stress in the financial markets makes it difficult for Uniti to refinance maturing debt on decent terms. The firm has no significant debt maturing until 2028, when more than half the total matures.Uniti cut its quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.05 in March 2019 and has since raised it to $0.15. It is likely to raise it only marginally, which it needs to do to continue qualifying as a real estate investment trust. With the reduced dividend level, we believe the firm can make the required interest and principal payments on its debt while maintaining a debt/EBITDA ratio of about 6.0. Beyond survival, we think Uniti's weak financial position inhibits its ability to operate as it had planned. The Windstream lease amendment removed the flexibility that the firm needed. Uniti was already highly leveraged, and we believe it intended to rely on equity issuance to fund expansion and diversification. If its stock remains depressed, we think Uniti will lack currency needed to buy additional assets.

24/11/2023,KDDI Seeing Some Stabilization in Mobile Competition,KDDI Corp,9433,3,03/11/2023,Dan Baker,4657.0,JPY,24/11/2023,4500.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,A,03/11/2023,"Narrow-moat KDDIs second-quarter fiscal 2023 result (quarter ended September 2023) was ahead of our expectations, making up for a weaker first quarter and leaving the business on track to beat its unchanged full year guidance of operating revenue rising 2.3%, and both operating income and net profit rising 0.4%, in our opinion. Second quarter operating revenue increased by 4.1% with operating profit up 12.3%. Most importantly, Muti-Brand communications ARPU revenues grew JPY3.7 billion year-on-year in the second quarter, having fallen by JPY 30.6 billion in the corresponding quarter a year ago and by JPY 2.9 billion in the first quarter. Mobile prices seem to have stabilized and KDDI should also gain from the extension of the roaming arrangement between KDDI and Rakuten announced in May, which should benefit KDDI by between JPY 10 billion and JPY 20 billion compared with previous estimates. We make slight upgrades to our forecasts and our fair value for KDDI increases to JPY4,500 from JPY4,400 previously. Our forecasts now assume KDDI increases fiscal 2023 operating profit by 3.1% and net profit by 7.3%. At this fair value, KDDI would trade on a fiscal 2023 price/earnings ratio of 13.6 times, with a 3.1% dividend yield. We see both KDDI and NTT as broadly fairly valued at current levels and would prefer them over SoftBank Corp. Our medium-term forecasts imply 2.3% operating income CAGR over the next five years. We believe competitive pressures on KDDIs key telecom business will remain reasonably high, particularly from SoftBank which is targeting adding over million customers in fiscal 2023, and to a lesser extent Rakuten which is still reporting large losses from its mobile business but had invested around JPY 2.6 trillion in cumulative EBITDA losses and capex in its telecom business as at June 2023. ","KDDI has increased its dividend each year for 21 years until fiscal 2022 and it is forecasting this streak to continue for fiscal 2023. Although Rakuten has built a fourth mobile network in Japan it does not yet have the scale to generte positive free cash flow. The early results of KDDI's Life Design services have been successful, which could provide a new line of growth.","All Japanese operators now have access to the iPhone and offer fixed/wireless bundles. Homogeneous service offerings could lead to excessive competition. Given a history of solid returns, the operators are always at some risk of Government intervention to force reduced prices, particularly for lower usage plans. If Rakuten can successfully leverage its brand name to gain enough customers for a maintainable mobile business, this will lower excess returns for all incumbents including KDDI. ",03/11/2023,"KDDI is Japan's second-largest telephone company, and Japan is one of our favorite wireless markets. In addition, the firm is now addressing most of our concerns regarding its long-term wireless strategy. Japan has three incumbent wireless operators, all of which have traditionally competed more on service and handset features than on price. Industry regulation in the country has been fairly benign, and the industry has traditionally successfully weathered threats to this competitive balance. In 2008, a fourth carrier, eMobile, entered the market, but it was acquired by SoftBank after only gaining about 3% share. This relatively benign competitive environment has allowed the industry to operate as an oligopoly, as evidenced by churn rates among the lowest in the world at less than 1% per month.  KDDI announced a medium-term plan in 2019 which targeted EPS of JPY 388 in fiscal year ended March 2025 largely driven by expected growth in its noncore Life Design products. Our forecasts are below the company's, which we attribute to an expected larger impact from Rakuten having to grow its customer base to reach critical scale and risks from further government intervention in pricing.  In mid-December 2017, Rakuten announced plans to raise debt of a maximum of JPY 200 billion to build out a mobile network in Japan which it subsequently launched in April 2020. While Rakuten only planned to spend around JPY 530 billion on its network compared with property and plant and equipment levels of around JPY 3 trillion for the incumbent operators, it had spent around JPY 2.6 trillion in cumulative EBITDA losses and capital expenditure by end June 2023. By this stage Rakuten had only around 5.2 million customers, with only 4.8 million of those on its own mobile network so needs to add more to build the scale to be profitable. KDDI has benefited from a domestic roaming agreement with Rakuten to provide roaming outside Rakutens network, and if Rakuten delays its network capital expenditure to preserve cash, then KDDI will likely benefit as the roaming partner. ","We believe KDDI has a narrow economic moat based on efficient scale in its mobile network business, which we estimate generates 46% of the companys revenue and around 66% of its operating profit. KDDI has generated ROICs averaging 12.5% over the past 10 years and the other two established mobile operators, NTT DoCoMo and SoftBank have also consistently earned above WACC returns. The Japanese mobile market was a three-player market for most of its history except for a period between 2007 and 2012 when Emobile entered the market. After gaining only 3% market share Emobile was taken over by SoftBank in 2012. In terms of returns the Japanese market has been mostly a cozy oligopoly. SoftBank Group did not disclose enough information to calculate domestic telecom ROICs prior to the year ended March 2016 but its returns have been over two times its Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACC since then. While NTT DoCoMo and KDDI have not generated returns as high as SoftBank they have still been above WACC. Despite earning higher operating profits, NTT DoCoMo and KDDI have greater invested capital of JPY 5.3 trillion and JPY 4.5 trillion respectively compared with SoftBank's JPY 3.3 trillion. Of course the risk for telecom companies in this situation is that governments or regulators start to get concerned that the incumbents are not competitive enough and are charging consumers too much money. Indeed, in August 2018, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was widely quoted as suggesting that competition was not working and that Japan's mobile carriers could lower fees by around 40%. At its result at the end of October 2018, NTT DoCoMo dropped a bombshell in announcing as part of its mid-term plan that it would be lowering its prices in the quarter-ending June 2019 to return up to JPY 400 billion (around 10% of its revenue) to customers so that its profits would decline and would not recover to current levels until fiscal 2023 (fiscal year ending in March 2024). Understandably, this announcement immediately hit the share prices of all three Japanese telecom companies. If the largest telecom operator in the market talks about dropping its prices by 20-40% for low end customers and reducing its overall revenue by around 10% then it is likely to impact on the other operators. The Japanese mobile market also went through several more bouts of price competition over the years to 2022.In mid-December 2017, Rakuten announced plans to raise debt to a maximum of JPY 200 billion to build out a mobile network in Japan which launched in April 2020. The business targets at least 10 million customers by the end of fiscal 2028. Rakuten's planned cumulative capital investment for the period from 2018 to 2028 was originally JPY 526 billion, but by June 2022 it had already spent JPY 1.6 trillion with a further JPY 1.6 trillion in cumulative EBITDA losses. KDDI has provided it with roaming in Japan in areas covered by KDDI, but not covered by Rakuten. Given the cash flow losses, KDDI has been able to extend its roaming agreement with Rakuten longer than first expected as Rakuten has had to slow its network rollout pace. We believe the impact of a new entrant is largely a function of how much money it is willing, and able to spend to enter the market. Rakuten currently earns an operating profit of around JPY 150 billion per year, less than 20% of the average operating profit generated by the incumbent telcos. Its current enterprise value is also less than 20% of the existing telcos. We also note that Rakutens core e-commerce business faces intense pressure mainly from Amazon and Yahoo Japan, with each company now having similar market share after Amazon has taken market share over the past few years. We believe its small size and pressure on existing business will limit how much extra capital Rakuten could put into the telecom business to increase its impact on the market. ","We assign KDDI a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low. The Japanese wireless market remains reasonably competitive. While SoftBank's acquisition of eMobile removed one operator, it is fighting back after KDDI's recent success. Additionally, DoCoMo used its early lead in LTE to re-establish its position as the technological leader. While KDDI righted its ship with an improved smartphone lineup and a faster network, there is no guarantee that it will retain its position as the second-largest wireless operator in Japan. With NTT DoCoMo also now able to offer fixed-line and mobile bundles, KDDI management has described the Japanese telecom offerings as becoming more ""homogeneous."" While we have seen no signs yet of excessive price competition, if the operators have decreased opportunities to differentiate on services, greater price competition could emerge. The industry saw several bouts of price competition in 2019 and 2021 and SoftBank has indicated that it is looking to add customers at a rate that would likely imply taking market share.The entry of Rakuten in the mobile network business poses some risks to KDDI, but we believe that it is unlikely to build a maintainable network operator business so any pricing pressure it brings is unlikely to be permanent. The government has made several requests over the past few years for operators to reduce certain prices. An aggressive forced price reduction would pose a risk to industry returns.","We rate KDDI's Capital Allocation as Standard.In our view KDDI has a solid investment track record, generally investing in businesses that add to its narrow economic moat core telecom business. We expect it to continue to invest in the core business through its 5G network investment. We also expect investment in various associated value-added services such as electricity retail and mobile payments, which leverage the core business, and we have seen some promising signs of early success from these new businesses. During the past 15 years, KDDI has had a generally successful merger and acquisition track record, using business combinations to increase both its scale and the breadth of its service offering in Japan. The most significant were the mergers with au in 2001 (mobile), Tepco's fibre network (fixed broadband) in 2007, and J:COM (cable TV) in 2010. These acquisitions have successfully provided the business with scale in mobile and the ability to bundle fixed-line products with its mobile product. Like many telecoms, KDDI is also investing in data centers, purchasing three data centers in Canada in June 2023 for CAD 1.35 billion. This strategy makes sense to us, but it is too early to judge the financial success of these data center purchases. Management execution has also been strong and we see no reason why this should not continue. The company increased its operating earnings by an average of 10% per year over the eight years to March 2020, which is a strong effort in a sector like telecom. Its medium-term target is to grow earnings per share by 50% in the six years to the fiscal 2024 (fiscal year ending in March 2025). Given the fresh competition coming in the telecom segment from Rakuten and pressure on pricing from the government, KDDI is targeting growth from its life design business, which includes finance, education, healthcare and previously mentioned electricity retail. We believe these strategies make sense given the competitive conditions expected in its core telecom market. To help offset the Rakuten risk KDDI also signed a deal to be the roaming partner for Rakuten. We believe the Japanese government may have pressured NTT DoCoMo to do it if others refused, so KDDI doing the deal makes sense because it has used Rakuten to generate extra traffic and revenue from more the lightly used network in regional areas. This has been a positive for KDDI during Rakuten's network build but the benefits will subside as Rakuten's network nears its planned coverage targets. An extension of this roaming agreement was signed in May 2023.With fiscal 2022 net debt/EBITDA of 0.4 times, KDDIs balance sheet is on the conservative side for a telecom services operator, with this ratio often ranging between 1 and 2 times for telecom services operators globally. However, KDDI is in the middle of its 5G network investment cycle, so a balance sheet on the conservative side is understandable. Given the conservative balance sheet and strong cash flow generation, we believe KDDIs dividend payout ratio, which has averaged around 40% over the past five years is on the low side. The company has committed to a dividend payout ratio of at least 40% out to fiscal 2024. However, the company has supplemented its dividend with JPY 150 billion per year of share buybacks over each of the past three years and these have mostly been done at prices below our fair value estimate for the stock so we believe they have added value. The company allowed for JPY 300 billion in buybacks in 2022. ","KDDI is Japan's second-largest wireless operator (31% market share), the largest pay-TV operator (53% market share) and the second-largest provider of fibre-to-the-home broadband (12% market share). It has grown through acquisition and is focusing on increasing the number of customers who subscribe to more than one telecommunication service. It is also looking to grow its Life Design business which includes commerce, energy, and finance and had over 42 million Internet of Things connections by the end of September 2023.","KDDI maintained net debt of between 0.2 and 1.0 times EBITDA during the past 10 years with the company trending to the lower end of the range during the past three years. We think this ratio conservative, but not overly so. The firm has raised its dividend in each of the past 13 years and is forecasting an increased dividend to JPY 140 per share in fiscal 2023 from JPY 135 in fiscal 2022. This equates to a dividend payout ratio of just over 40% and the company will likely repurchase its own shares with free cash flow left over after the dividend and growth investment. This payout ratio still puts it below several developed market peers with above-70% payout ratios.KDDI split its stock twice in fiscal 2012. First, it completed a 100-for-1 split on Sept. 30, 2012, and then a 2-for-1 split on March 31, 2013. It also carried out a three-for-one split on March 31, 2014. These splits are testament to how much the stock price has appreciated over the past several years, and to management's determination to keep the share price accessible for retail investors.",9433.T,Communication Services,9615037169664.0,JPX,3173300.0,JPY,4657.0,True,0,4345.014749666535,4563.135000494461,0

Otherwise, changes to our commodity price assumptions are mixed, led by higher near-term iron ore prices and lower near-term thermal coal prices. We think thermal coal miner Whitehaven Coal and minerals sands miner Iluka are the cheapest we cover. Both trade at 29% discounts to our AUD 9.50 and AUD 10.50 per share fair value estimates, respectively, with Whitehavens down 3% on lower near-term thermal coal prices, partially offset by a weaker Australian dollar. Peer New Hope is also down 3% to AUD 6.10 per share. Ilukas estimate is unchanged, with a weaker Australian dollar offsetting lower synthetic rutile prices. Lower nickel, copper, and thermal coal prices more than offset higher zinc prices and we cut our Glencore estimate 6% to GBX 500. However, we retain our estimate for Glencores acquisition target Teck Resources of USD 40. Gold prices are modestly lower on higher bond yields. However, we retain our fair value estimates for gold miners Newmont, Barrick, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross of USD 54, USD 21, USD 53, and USD 5.20 per share, respectively. We also maintain our estimate for Newcrest of AUD 33 in line with Newmonts offer. Higher iron ore prices drive increased fair value estimates for Fortescue and Deterra, up 7% to AUD 16 and up 8% to AUD 4.20, respectively. They more than offset lower copper prices, and for Vale, lower nickel prices too, and we raise our estimates for BHP, Rio Tinto, and Vale by 4%, to AUD 41, AUD 111, and USD 14.50, respectively. Higher iron ore and metallurgical coal prices and a weaker GBP/USD rate more than offset weaker platinum group metals and diamond prices, with our fair value estimate for Anglo American up 5% to GBX 2,650. South32s estimate falls 5% to AUD 3.90, with higher metallurgical coal prices outweighed by lower prices for other commodities.","Large platinum and diamond businesses give Anglo the kind of exposure to late-stage commodities that major mining peers don't possess. The company has a good selection of growth options, including its recently opened Quellaveco copper mine and its Woodsmith polyhalite project in the United Kingdom.  The company is focused on improving efficiency through the use of productivity initiatives and technology such as automation.","Labor unrest and periodic calls for mining industry nationalization represent a source of concern for Anglo's South African assets. The transition to electric vehicles represents a long-term headwind to demand and prices for platinum group metals. Anglos assets generally sit higher on their industry cost curves than competitors, meaning the company is more leveraged to changes in commodity prices. ",16/10/2023,"As China rebalances away from infrastructure and construction-led growth, Anglo American is likely better positioned than most diversified peers. The company has greater exposure to consumption-oriented commodities like platinum and diamonds, which should enjoy better demand growth than investment-oriented commodities like iron ore and copper that prospered most in the past decade.  Anglo's platinum business should benefit as rising household incomes bolster Chinese demand for automobiles and jewelry, categories that collectively account for roughly 80% to 90% of platinum and palladium use in China. However, in the longer term, electric vehicles are likely to satisfy a greater share of demand for vehicles, weighing on demand for platinum and palladium for catalytic converters. An 85% stake in De Beers makes Anglo the world's largest diamond miner. As with platinum and palladium, there's big upside to Chinese diamond demand, which now stands at about 10% of the global total. Realizing that upside will take more than rising Chinese incomes as diamonds lack the cultural resonance they have in the U.S., so maximizing Chinese diamond demand will come down to marketing. If Chinese brides come to view diamond engagement rings as a must-have like their American and Japanese counterparts did in the 20th century, diamonds have tremendous upside. Like other large miners, Anglos balance sheet is strong as a result of elevated commodity prices in recent years. Net debt at the end of June was around USD 9 billion. After focusing for much of the past decade on incremental expansion of its existing operations through cost and volume improvements, Anglo is now turning to developing its greenfields growth pipeline. This includes its 60%-owned Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which began production in 2022, while we think Anglo will also likely develop its Woodsmith crop nutrients (polyhalite) project in the United Kingdom in coming years. ","As a commodity producer, Anglo is a price taker and needs low-cost mines with long lives and a low installed capital base to support the longer-term excess returns needed to justify an economic moat. We forecast midcycle returns on invested capital in the mid-single digits, materially below its weighted average cost of capital of about 9.5%. As Anglos midcycle ROIC is below its WACC, we dont assign the company a moat.Our forecast is based on assumed midcycle prices from 2027 for copper, iron ore and metallurgical coal of about USD 3.10 per pound, USD 60 per metric ton (which we note is materially less than the average price of around USD 100 per metric ton over the past decade), and USD 150 per metric ton, respectively, based on our estimates of the marginal costs of production. We also assume platinum prices of USD 800 per ounce, palladium prices of USD 1,500 per ounce, rhodium prices of USD 6,950 per ounce, and nickel prices of about USD 8.50 per pound from 2024 based on spot. In calculating ROIC, we have added back to invested capital about USD 23 billion of asset and intangibles writedowns taken over the past decade on the basis that these amounts relate to assets developed or acquired in the ordinary course of business and so should be included when calculating ROIC. Some of the more material amounts include USD 8.9 billion in relation to iron ore and USD 4.9 billion in relation to coal. If we instead chose not to add back any writedowns, Anglos midcycle ROIC would nonetheless still be lower than its WACC of around 9.5%. Alternatively, we would have to assume prices are on average about 15% higher than our base-case assumptions for Anglos ROIC to equal its WACC. Looking at each of Anglos segments in turn: Copper (no moat): Anglos new 60%-owned Quellaveco mine in Peru has relatively low unit costs, placing it on or around the 25th percentile of the copper cost curve, and it has a likely remaining life of more than two decades. We think Quellaveco will also improve the copper divisions average position on the industry cost curve as it ramps up. However, with Collahuasi and Los Bronces comprising most of the divisions other copper production and on average being at a middling position on the industry cost curve, nevertheless the copper division overall is likely to remain comfortably within the second quartile of the cost curve. At our assumed midcycle copper price of USD 3.10 per pound from 2027, we think the copper division is unlikely to consistently generate returns above Anglos cost of capital and so we dont deem it moatworthy.Iron ore (no moat): Unit cash costs at its mines in Brazil and South Africa are higher than its major competitors BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, and Fortescue, not only due to its materially lower production, but also due to the costs of upgrading its lower-grade ore at Minas Rio in Brazil in particular. Freight costs are also higher than those of the Australian iron ore majors due to the greater distance from Brazil and South Africa to customers including those in China. However, as the average grade of Anglos salable iron ore is above the 62% benchmark and includes a high proportion of both lump and pellets, Anglo tends to receive a pricing premium compared with the Australian iron ore majors. Driven by the cost blow out to build Minas Rio in Brazil, which cost about USD 13.8 billion to purchase and then construct, we think the iron ore division is unlikely to consistently generate returns above Anglos cost of capital at our assumed midcycle iron ore price of roughly USD 60 per metric ton from 2027. As such, we dont deem it moatworthy.Platinum group metals (no moat): The company accounts for about one third of the worlds platinum supply and around 30% of global palladium supply. While Anglos mines are generally large and long life, they arent particularly low cost on average. The other major supplier is Russia which is low cost thanks to high grade operations owned by Nornickel (Norilsk). While the company has benefitted from surging PGM prices recentlyespecially for rhodium, with Anglo producing around 40% of global supply, and to a lesser extent palladiumwe think PGM prices are likely to moderate over the forecast period as they return closer to cost curve support. As such, we think the PGM division is also unlikely to consistently generate returns above Anglos cost of capital and so dont deem it moatworthy. Diamonds (De Beers) (no moat): While De Beers is the second largest diamond producer in the world by volume, its rough diamonds tend to sell for higher average prices than those of competitors. Led by Jwaneng in Botswana, De Beers major diamond mines are large, low-cost, and long life. We forecast the Diamonds segment will generate mid-single-digit returns on invested capital from midcycle and dont deem it moatworthy. Nickel (no moat): Anglos wholly owned Barro Alto and Codemin mines in Brazil are middling on the industry cost curve and in our view are likely to remain so over the forecast period. At our forecast midcycle nickel price of USD 8.50 per pound from 2024, we forecast mid-single-digit returns on invested capital from midcycle and we dont deem the Nickel segment moatworthy either. Metallurgical (or steelmaking) coal (no moat): Increased production at Moranbah and Grosvenor will likely lead to cash operating costs falling over our forecast period, but the companys operations are likely to remain middling at best on the industry cost curve. At a midcycle metallurgical price of around USD 150 per ton from 2027, we forecast low-single-digit returns on invested capital from midcycle. As such, we dont deem this segment moatworthy either. Exploration projects (no moat): These are an immaterial part of Anglo and way too early in their potential development to assign any of them a moat. However, for context, Anglos expenditure is relatively modest relative to earnings, spending about USD 160 million in 2022 versus about USD 14 billion in EBITDA.","We rate Anglo American's Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as High. As with all mining companies, a severe and lengthy downturn in commodity prices represents the greatest risk to Anglo. With its assets generally higher on their industry cost curves than its large mining competitors, margins are below its major peers and so Anglo has significant operating leverage. Country risk is also a concern. Anglo's South African heritage is a blessing and a curse. Anglo controls many of the crown jewels of the country's mineral endowment, with assets ranging from iron ore to platinum and diamonds. But frequent labor unrest and periodic calls for nationalization cast doubts over future profits and Anglo's rights to those profits. Anglo faces currency risk, with many of its costs denominated in South African rand, Chilean pesos, Peruvian soles, and Australian dollars, while the bulk of its revenue and debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. Dollar depreciation relative to the currencies where many of its operations are located reduces operating margins for the company. Financial leverage and risk from debt is relatively low.","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Anglo American. The key considerations for our rating are balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions. Overall, we think the firm is doing a reasonable job with the hand it has been dealt. As a commodity producer lacking durable cost advantages, it is difficult for Anglo to excel, but its balance sheet is sound and likely to remain so, despite elevated growth expenditures in the near to medium term. The company has taken steps to better exploit the investments already made, so in a tough industry we think management is investing fairly. Maintaining a sound balance sheet and investments were prioritized over shareholder distributions, which we think is appropriate. Over the longer term, Anglos investments are likely to be the most important factor for total shareholder returns. Given Anglo's assets, business model and the challenges of investing with a backdrop of cyclical commodity prices, we lack the confidence required to conclude the firm will consistently make value and competitive position-enhancing investments. Hence, we consider the Standard rating most appropriate.With a large portion of its assets cash flow negative in the 2015 downturn, then-CEO Mark Cutifani directed business units to close down or sell unprofitable operations. Costs were cut across the board while profitability in its core assets was also helped by the recovery in commodity prices from 2016 onward. The company received good prices from its asset sales, and along with improved commodity prices and capital discipline, saw the balance sheet returned to appropriate health. Commodity prices fortunately improved before the firm sold off any of its prime assets, such as its metallurgical coal mines in Australia. Returns have dramatically improved in recent years. Adjusted ROIC excluding goodwill was about 8% in 2020, close to the company's cost of capital, and with high commodity prices, especially iron ore, reached around 19% in 2021. However, we think commodity prices will moderate over our forecast period, and forecast Anglos midcycle ROIC will fall to midsingle digits in 2026, materially below its cost of capital. More recently, Anglo has started to emphasize increasing production, led by the development of its 60%-owned Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which began production in 2022. We dont expect any significant changes to Anglos capital allocation framework under CEO Duncan Wanblad, who took over from Cutifani in April 2022. ","Anglo American's mining portfolio spans many commodities and continents. Like fellow large diversified miners, Anglo has significant exposure to copper, iron ore and metallurgical coal, but it is unique among the global majors given its significant platinum group metals and diamonds output. The company accounts for about one third of the worlds platinum supply and around 30% of palladium supply. Anglo also owns 85% of De Beers, in most years the world's largest supplier and marketer of rough gem diamonds by value. Anglo also plans to move back into the crop nutrients business via its Woodsmith polyhalite project in the United Kingdom.","Anglo American is in sound financial health. Net debt was about USD 9 billion at the end of June, less than 1 times annualized EBITDA. We forecast EBIT/net interest to remain comfortable at above 10 over our five-year forecast period, while net debt/EBITDA is expected to average below 0.5 over our forecast period. The company has strong liquidity with USD 7.8 billion cash at the end of June. The average debt maturity at the end of June was around eight years. Regardless of its strong financial position though, the company's operations still retain significant operating leverage given they are generally higher on their industry cost curves than competitors.",AAL.L,Basic Materials,29928353792.0,LSE,425029.0,GBp,2238.0,True,1,2110.2277860753647,1832.5190782661816,0
25/11/2023,Xiabuxiabu's Value-Oriented Model Should Fare Well During Economic Uncertainty,Xiabuxiabu Catering Management (China) Hldgs Co Ltd,00520,4,28/08/2023,Ivan Su,3.25,HKD,24/11/2023,4.7,High,,Standard,,28/08/2023,"We trimmed our fair value estimate for no-moat Xiabuxiabu to $4.7 per share from $4.9, after management lowered full-year 2023 guidance. While softening macroeconomic conditions are certainly a factor, the business' underperformance in same-store sales in China is concerning. With Xiabuxiabu being the only restaurant operator under our coverage that lowered unit opening guidance for 2023, the business seems to be facing more challenges than its peers. We still think Xiabuxiabu's shares are undervalued, but we believe continued profitability concerns could create a more attractive entry point. We recommend investors wait until ongoing macroeconomic weakness is fully priced before buying Xiabuxiabu. In the first half of 2023, revenue increased 32% year over year. The restaurant industry is one of the biggest beneficiaries of China's reopening, and Xiabuxiabu's sales growth shows how quickly the industry is recovering from lows in 2022. That said, China's weak macroeconomic conditions remain an overhang on restaurant sales, evidenced by the group's same-store sales still trending significantly below the prepandemic level. The group opened 67 net new units in the first half, translating to about 7% restaurant unit growth compared with the end of 2022. But management sounded downbeat on the second-half outlook and lowered Coucou's opening target to 45 from 70. Despite the jump in sales, the firm still incurred operating losses of CNY 27 million for the period. Looking at individual cost items, staff cost as a percentage of revenue remained elevated at 33%, versus just 27% in 2019. We think this is mainly a reflection of deteriorating unit economics at the premium Coucou chain (50% of revenue). We expect an operating profit in the second half as the group gradually pulls back from promotional activities. Our valuation for the company assumes a midcycle operating profit margin of 4.4%, roughly half of what it achieved prior to the pandemic.","Value-oriented operations like the Xiabuxiabu brand tend to outperform during times of economic uncertainty.  Owing to its signature one-person hot pot, the namesake Xiabuxiabu brand is well-positioned to benefit from Chinas demographic shifts.  Wage hikes, urbanization trends, and relatively young populations should continue to drive restaurant spending across China.","Although the zero-COVID-19 policy is now over, restaurants still contend with cautious spending patterns.  Consumer spending may shift toward cheaper grocery and convenience store channels if the macroenvironment continues to deteriorate.  As Xiabuxiabus rivals continue to spawn across markets, price competition will likely intensify.",28/08/2023,"Xiabuxiabus multiconcept portfolio, operating its namesake and Coucou brand, represents the second-largest hot pot restaurant chain in China. Despite having more than 1,000 locations, we still see unit growth and cost reduction possibilities, as well as the potential to add more brands to its portfolio over time. The hot pot chain operates in a highly competitive industry marked by nonexistent switching costs, minimal barriers to entry, and quickly evolving consumer preferences. Even with the firms leadership in the hot pot category, long-term investors will need to contend with the above-average cyclicality of the restaurant business. Against the backdrop of weak economic recovery in China, a value-oriented menu is very important in the near term. With an average ticket of about CNY 70 (versus the category average of CNY 90), the groups namesake brand could benefit from downtrading, but this would come at the expense of Coucou, which has a much more premium position with an average ticket of CNY 140.  Over the longer term, we believe there are several opportunities for Xiabuxiabu to gain a share in the fragmented, USD 700-billion Chinese restaurant market. In China, chains account for roughly 18% of restaurant spending compared with 61% in the U.S. and 34% across the globe. Our conviction in rising fast food penetration is underpinned by three long-term secular trends: longer working hours for urban consumers; rapidly rising disposable income; and ever-smaller family sizes. ","Nonexistent switching costs, intense industry rivalry, and low barriers to entry make it challenging for restaurant operators to develop an economic moat. China, in particular, is one of the most competitive restaurant markets in the world, characterized by extreme fragmentation of operators, the prevalence of small mom-and-pop restaurants, and quick market share swings among top chains. In our view, the restaurants that carve out an enduring competitive edge do so in one of two ways: 1) by developing a strong brand that permits price increases or traffic gains beyond category inflation; or 2) by leaning into a scale-driven cost advantage, leveraging negotiating power with technology, delivery, and food distributor partners to operate at a structurally lower cost than smaller peers. But even with Xiabuxiabu's leading market share in the hot pot category, we do not think the firm has fully developed the brand intangible assets or cost advantages sufficient for an economic moat. As a group, Xiabuxiabu generated about CNY 4.7 billion in sales in 2022, a small fraction of our systemwide sales estimates for established-moat restaurant chains such as Yum China (CNY 68 billion in 2022). Examining the group's restaurant concepts in greater detail, the namesake Xiabuxiabu brand started as a pioneer in ""hot pot for one"" offering each diner their own pot for cooking ingredients. The brand currently contributes about half of the group's revenue. Compared with the traditional style of communal hot pot, the Xiabuxiabu brand caters to solo or smaller groups of young diners who often hesitate to enter a conventional hot pot venue. Benefiting from its differentiated positioning as a value-oriented quick-service hot pot brand, Xiabuxiabu is now China's second-largest hot pot brand, with about a 1% market share. The brand's success and compelling unit economics (breakeven within three months of opening and payback in 17 months) have not gone unnoticed, spawning multiple rivals with aggressive growth aspirations across the casual dining segment and within the hot pot subcategories. We believe the rising competition was one of the reasons that led to a decline in returns on invested capital, or ROICs, from 2016 onward. In addition to a more intensive competitive landscape, the company struggled with management missteps that alienated its core customers. Trying to ride the tides of consumption upgrades, Xiabuxiabu started launching more expensive menu items in 2017. Although the initiative benefited sales, with average tickets up 15% in just two years, same-store sales began to falter. Price hikes from 2017 to 2019 led the brand to lose touch with its core customers slowly, and we believe declines in ROICs over the past years reflect diners leaving Xiabuxiabu for more value-oriented alternatives. For the most part, we attribute the brand's economic profit in the 2010s to its early mover advantage in a hot pot market growing at double-digit rates. Although there could be a couple more years of economic profit generation ahead, we do not have confidence that this concept could consistently earn economic profits over the next decade. We anticipate that category rivalry will escalate over the next several years, forcing firms to increasingly compete on price, product differentiation, and market share. Despite fierce competition, only a few restaurant operators, like KFC, have been able to consistently stay ahead of the competition over decadesagainst the average life span of 18 months for an average restaurant business. According to our restaurant life cycle model, we believe most restaurant concepts go through four phases of development: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Although the majority of restaurant operators can't generate excess returns for a 10-year-plus period, the few that have done so have undergone a combination of menu innovations, cost optimization, daypart expansion, and evolution into a diversified retail/consumer packaged goods platform. In the case of the firm's Xiabuxiabu brand, we think it is now at a stage of maturity, and it is uncertain how much room there is for the two-decade-old concept to grow (240 units were closed in 2021 and 2022, but management thinks it can open 200-plus stores in 2023). In essence, we are uncertain whether the brand can fend off concept fatigue and deliver above-inflation same-store sales growth over the long run. For similar reasons, we are also skeptical of higher-end Coucou's ability to create economic value over a 10-year horizon. Coucou is a premium hot pot concept launched in 2016, and it has delivered impressive growth over the past couple of years. The brand differentiates itself by offering premium Taiwanese hot pot and milk tea, plus an upscale interior design and elegant food presentation . Benefiting from its unique positioning, Coucou quickly expanded its footprint to over 200 domestic locations and a dozen overseas ones. That said, with its very high price points (average ticket 40% above Haidilao's), Coucou's total addressable market is much smaller than that of its hot pot peers.Furthermore, we think a lot of Coucou's customers were paying for the one-off experience and are unlikely to come back after the initial novelty fades. Lastly, with its average ticket at CNY 140, it is hard to imagine Coucou can be successful across the country. With more than 90% of its units located in first- and second-tier cities, we think the brand has already picked most of the easy wins in its new openings and would struggle to find attractive unit expansion opportunities in the future. Finally, while the larger-chained operators tend to carve out a scale-driven cost advantage, we view such a designation as inappropriate for the restaurant group. Given the firm's national presence, we believe it has some influence over suppliers, which helps to provide access to food and other raw materials at competitive prices. However, with CNY 4.7 billion in systemwide sales during 2022 (about 0.1% of China's restaurant market), Xiabuxiabu represents a tiny fraction of the systemwide sales achieved by established-moat restaurant chains such as Yum China (CNY 68 billion). This makes it difficult to argue that Xiabuxiabu has a more favorable bargaining position with suppliers. Additionally, we do not believe the firm's restaurant buildout costs differ materially from the rest of the hot pot industry. Thus, we do not consider cost advantages a potential source of Xiabuxiabu's economic moat.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Xiabuxiabu is High.As China's restaurant industry consolidates, we expect restaurant operators to increasingly compete with one another on price and product differentiation, with aggressive (and often irrational) promotional activity likely to escalate. In addition to increased competition, Xiabuxiabu must contend with GDP growth and consumer spending volatility, state-mandated wage rate increases, and uneven commodity costeach of which could hurt top-line growth and profitability. Restaurants, in general, are also susceptible to negative publicity tied to food quality concerns, which can result in substantial drops in near-term foot traffic.The firm also remains sensitive to execution risks, with a unit growth strategy leaning heavily on newer concepts like Coucou and Shaohot. These new restaurant brands only have a handful of locations in Tier 1 and 2 cities, so theres a high degree of uncertainty whether nascent concepts can successfully be replicated across multiple markets, especially in lower-tier cities where people are more price-sensitive. Turning to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, we believe Xiabuxiabu faces average risk from product governance. While the company has taken adequate steps to increase its disclosure and improve upstream practices, the risk remains for a firm whose principal asset is its brand, with negative publicity representing a risk to the firm's brand cachet.","Overall, we rate Xiabuxiabus Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating as Standard. The rating reflects our belief that Xiabuxiabu possesses a sound balance sheet, a reasonable record of investments, and largely fair shareholder distributions.We believe Xiabuxiabu holds a sound balance sheet with low levels of risk regarding the size of the debt carried, the business cyclicality facing the firm, and the debt maturity outlook. While an argument could be made to increase the leverage of the balance sheet to be more active in investing, we believe the company (along with other firms in the industry) should hold ample balance sheet strength to support supply chain investments and opportunistic acquisitions.Turning to investments, we believe Xiabuxiabu is operating at a reasonable level. Looking at the company's extended history, its new restaurants have maintained remarkable payback periods of under two years. The Coucou brand also quickly scaled from zero to 200 units in under six years, while delivering healthy sales and margins. Meanwhile, new concept Shaohot seems to be gaining some traction in the barbecue category, but because it is still in very early stages (with only few locations), we dont expect it to be materially value-adding. Hence, we assess investment as fair at this point. Finally, we view Xiabuxiabus shareholder distribution philosophy as appropriate, with the magnitude of dividends appearing appropriate at this stage in the companys lifecycle. Going into the next couple of years, we expect dividend payout to remain around 30%, before gradually ticking up to 50% over the longer term.","Xiabuxiabu Catering Management is a Chinese multibrand restaurant operator. The firm generates most of its revenue from two hot pot restaurant chainsXiabuxiabu and Coucou. Started in 1998, the namesake Xiabuxiabu brand is known for serving the Chinese hot pot format in a value-oriented, quick-service setting. Diners of Xiabuxiabu usually sit on bar counters, and a pot is provided for each diner. The Coucou brand was launched in 2016 as part of the group's foray into the high-end hot pot market. Unlike the group's namesake restaurant, Coucou serves Taiwanese-style hot pot in a beautifully decorated sit-down setting. The group does not franchise any of its restaurant brands, meaning all of its restaurants are self-operated and company-owned.","Xiabuxiabu holds a strong financial position with a large degree of flexibility. As of the end of 2022, the firm was in a net cash position of CNY 300 million, suggesting that it remains on solid financial footing.With its net cash position and our expectation for free cash flow generation over the next five years, we expect Xiabuxiabu to return cash to shareholders through dividends while also internally funding growth and restaurant productivity initiatives. We don't anticipate any material changes to the firm's capital structure during the next few years.",0520.HK,,,,,,3.289999961853028,True,1,3.4971693395132526,2.1795061723679012,0
24/11/2023,Hoshizaki's Commercial Kitchen Equipment Sales in Japan Supported by Inbound Tourism,Hoshizaki Corp,6465,3,15/11/2023,Jason Kondo,4713.0,JPY,24/11/2023,5200.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,15/11/2023,"Hoshizakis September-quarter revenue of JPY 98 billion, up 11% year on year, and 12.8% operating margin were better than expected, mainly due to strong sales of its high-margin ice makers in the Americas region, which grew 40%. A better product mix from weaker sales of low-margin refrigerators, due to continued inventory adjustments by distributors in the U.S. and refrigerator production issues in Europe, also pushed margins higher. As these issues will last longer than previously expected, we now expect the better product mix to continue until the first quarter of 2024. We raise our 2023 revenue growth projection by 2 percentage points to 15.5% year on year and operating margin assumption to 11.3% from 10.9%, but our 2024 projection remains unchanged. We expect operating margin to be flat in 2024, despite a 4% revenue growth, as increased production/sales of refrigerators in the Americas/Europe will offset the impact of operating leverage in Asia. With our outlook intact, we maintain our fair value estimate at JPY 5,200, suggesting Hoshizakis shares are fairly valued. In its main market, Japan, revenue growth was 3.5% year on year, largely in line with our estimate. Despite the inflationary environment, the recovery in inbound tourism has supported replacement demand as well as stable service sales. As we expect this to continue, we project domestic sales to increase 8.5% year on year in 2023 (slightly up from 7.5% previously), with second-half sales growing 3.5%, compared with 14% in the first half. For 2024, we project Japan sales to grow 3% year on year as pubs increase investments. According to the Japan Food Association, September sales of pubs are still about 31% below 2019 levels, while monthly fast food restaurant sales are already 23% higher and family restaurants are only 1.6% lower. Further, we expect Hoshizaki to continue building its track record of supplying to facilities other than restaurants, such as to hotels, cafeterias, and hospitals.","Stable long-term profit growth potential as the leading commercial kitchen equipment player in Japan. Global expansion strategy is supported by strong global brand recognition with its ice machine and beer dispenser. High cash balance, lack of debt, and stable free cash flow generation presents opportunities for growth investments as well as dividend/buyback increases.","Limited structural barriers in its product and market environment leaves room for low cost competitors to increase share over the long term. Increased global competition, consecutive goodwill impairments overseas in the past, and lower track record outside Japan present hurdles/uncertainties for overseas expansion. Minor progress on corporate governance reforms, since its accounting scandal, makes investors skeptical about the companys overall direction.",15/11/2023,"As the largest commercial kitchen equipment manufacturer in Japan, the company utilizes its domestic network of 440 offices/branches to not only sell its products but to promptly provide maintenance services to its customers throughout Japan. This allows Hoshizaki to have a competitive advantage with scale in Japan, where the majority of its total sales are generated. Hoshizakis sales is mainly done directly, which allows the company to maintain relationships with its customers. These factors have allowed the company to attain the leading market share with its key products such as commercial refrigerators, ice machines, and beer dispensers, as well as a brand (known for its penguin logo in Japan) in the ""cold"" kitchen equipment space. We expect the companys strong reputation and its competitive advantage in scale to allow the company to maintain the leading share and prevent competitors from making a material impact on its incumbent status in future. Hoshizakis overseas strategy differs to its domestic strategy as it has less of a track record and a brand thats not as strong globally. The company has been focusing on inorganic growth to expand overseas, where the company has acquired commercial kitchen equipment makers in the United States, Brazil, China, Turkey, and Denmark. With mixed results of consecutive goodwill impairments in Americas, Asia and Europe in the past as well as selling its stake in a former Chinese affiliate due to difficulty in meeting its targets, there is higher uncertainty over whether it can effectively integrate its overseas affiliates. However, we expect stable growth will be supported by Hoshizakis ice machines and beer dispensers, and its strong capital base will allow the company to invest in new developments to remain competitive in a postpandemic world. ","Wide Moat in Domestic BusinessWe assign Hoshizaki a wide moat rating with its moat source primarily based on intangible assets in its business in Japan, which accounted for about 60% of total revenue in fiscal 2022. In Japan, Hoshizaki has a high brand recognition as a result of its long history selling refrigerators and ice machines for over 50 years and has maintained its position as the largest commercial kitchen equipment company in terms of sales. We estimate Hoshizakis leading domestic market share to be about 25% by value (excluding non-Hoshizaki products sold by the company), whereas we estimate its main domestic competitors Fukushima Galileis and Daiwa Industrys respective shares to be about 15% and 5%. As for its main products, according to Hoshizaki, the company boasts the leading domestic market share in commercial refrigerators (46% share by units), ice machines (59% share), and dishwashing machines (49% share) in their respective markets. These businesses together comprise about a half of the companys total revenue, and we expect these products to continue being the main driver of the companys wide moat. We consider Hoshizakis service network, track record, and its customer relationships to be its main sources of intangible assets for its business in Japan, and to a lesser extent we see its brand to be a contributing factor as well. In Japan, the company has a direct-selling model and mainly utilizes its domestic network of 440 offices/branches to sell its products and provide maintenance services to its Japanese customers. Hoshizaki also utilizes its large-scale domestic service network by repairing equipment made by other manufacturers for its customers and its large-scale service network allows same-day repair services for kitchen equipment. We believe the effects of the companys competitive advantage in terms of scale in its service network is a strong moat source, since being able to provide accessible service affects customers purchasing decisions when buying commercial kitchen equipment and the company can directly build relationships with customers, without the need to use distributors to sell its products (whereas smaller companies require distributors to expand its sales). Further, we think this especially helps the company in landing orders from major chain restaurants in Japan as this would give the customers an incentive to purchase kitchen equipment in all or most of its restaurants throughout Japan (and likely receive a per unit discount when purchasing in bulk) as well as receive prompt service by Hoshizaki in all its domestic branches. As a result of its strong intangible assets in its service business, Hoshizaki has been able to maintain service-related sales between 17% and 20% of total revenue, whereas service revenues by its main domestic competitors, Fukushima Galilei and Daiwa Industry, have been at about 8%-9% of total revenue. We rate the company a wide moat as we expect the company will maintain its status as the market leader in Japan with its scale in both service network and sales structure, and the likelihood of market disruption in the future is low, as we do not see any signs or evidence of changing dynamics in the market where low- cost competitors are entering the Japanese commercial kitchen equipment market and taking share.Barriers to entry exist, because it takes time for new entrants to develop and establish a track record/reputation for reliability, as well as create a service structure that can meet customer requirements. With product price levels and technology/features being at similar levels among the incumbent players, many customers especially place importance on both the total cost of ownership throughout the useful life of the equipment and the quality of service when purchasing the products and as a result, scale becomes a major factor on the service quality. For a new market entrant to become a potential threat to Hoshizaki, the company would have to provide lower cost products with similar levels of technology (especially since higher levels of energy saving technology lowers the customers total cost of ownership) throughout Japan, as well as provide a level of service that can minimize additional direct/indirect costs of ownership, such as breakdowns, And so on, Having a large service network ensures proximity to customers, which in turn allows promptness of service for customers who are relying on a functioning kitchen equipment for their stores, restaurants, or cafeterias. Further, there is a tendency for higher service charges when more travel is required by the service staff, which usually comes as a result of having fewer branches, which can negatively affect customers purchasing decisions. Therefore, we expect it would take time for a company to be able to provide prompt service throughout Japan, as it would not only require upfront costs in establishing new service branches but also take time in establishing a service structure (for example. hiring, training, spreading awareness, being acknowledged by customers for quality service, and so on.) to the point where a market entrant can affect Hoshizakis economic moat. With these barriers created from Hoshizakis moat source, we believe it would take a significant amount of time and effort to have potential future entrants take enough share where Hoshizakis competitive advantage would be affected.Among Hoshizakis existing domestic competitors, we see Fukushima Galilei as the main competitor that can potentially affect Hoshizakis competitive advantage over the long term. In January 2020, a Japanese retail conglomerate Aeon group installed Fukushimas CO2 refrigerated display-case (for frozen food/ice cream and so forth) for its new retail facility in Okayama, Japan, even though Aeon Group had mostly employed CO2 refrigerated display cases from Panasonic until this facility construction and the purchasing manager noted that there was no difference in cost between the equipment by Fukushima and Panasonic. While Fukushima has been increasing its market share in the commercial kitchen equipment industry at a faster rate than other incumbent players, we think it would be less likely that Hoshizakis main products (that is its source of its intangible assets), commercial refrigerators, ice machines, dishwashers, and beer dispensers be replaced. Based on our market share estimates, Fukushimas market share has nearly doubled over the past decade to approximately 15%. However, Hoshizakis market share has mainly remained relatively intact at close to 25% for the same term, implying that Fukushimas market share increase occurred mainly from taking other competitors market shares and that Hoshizakis moat in Japan has been resilient over the long term. Further, with above three times Fukushimas revenue, we still expect Hoshizakis strong service network and track record to allow the company to maintain its competitive advantage for the foreseeable future, especially since other domestic competitors such as Daiwa Industry and Fujimak are not catching up to Hoshizaki in terms of revenue growth or sales amount.Environmental, Social, and Governance RisksWe currently do not expect Hoshizakis wide economic moat or Uncertainty ratings to be downgraded from ESG factors; however, we think company-specific risks related to business ethics still exist, as poor governance has led to a series of scandals in the past. These scandals exposed weak management of corporate governance issues, ranging from audit systems to management of human capital, which include improper incentive systems as well as cultural factors that encouraged breach of business ethics. Further, the companys ROIC was impacted from costs related to the scandal and as a result, we believe Hoshizakis ESG risk is on the higher end out of our Japanese industrials coverage. Nevertheless, we think the company has been showing improvements on governance and that the companys intangible assets moat source remains intact.In October 2018, Hoshizaki reported inappropriate transactions (such as fictitious orders) by one of its domestic subsidiaries, Hoshizaki Tokai, involving at least 70 of its employees and delayed its earnings announcement for the companys third quarter results. It was later discovered through an investigation by its auditor that the head office instructed sales executives across Japan on how to respond to investigation experts, which creates governance issues regarding independence as well as impartiality. Subsequently, Hoshizaki disclosed that it discovered other inappropriate transactions involving its U.S. subsidiary Hoshizaki America, which came to light with the help of a whistleblower, and Hoshizaki postponed its fiscal 2018 earnings announcement. Hoshizaki later disclosed that further investigations revealed fictitious orders and sales being accounted for in four other domestic subsidiaries.We currently do not expect further costs related to the scandal in our projection scenarios, but we will consider reflecting potential impact of poor ESG risk in our bear case scenario if Hoshizaki shows any sign of poor governance that can materially weaken its reputation. Since the initial reporting of its scandals, we think Hoshizaki has been able to make progress in improving its governance as well as disclosure policies. For example, with the support of activist investor, Oasis Management, the company made much-needed changes, such as the chairman returning his representative rights, the introduction of an executive officer system, disclosure of updates on its corporate governance reforms, and dismissal of key members who participated in the scandal. Although we do not believe Hoshizaki is out of the woods yet, by improving its management of ESG risks, the company has been able to prevent a permanent deterioration of its reputation, which could have impacted its long-term competitiveness.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Hoshizaki is Medium, where we expect low-single-digit sales growth in Japan for our three projection scenarios. While there is more volatility in its overseas businesses, we expect sales in Japan will continue to comprise above 60% of revenue over the medium term, assuming the company does not pursue any overseas acquisitions that can materially change the breakdown of revenue. The largest risks for Hoshizaki are: 1) a recession that can cause restaurants and other customers to go out of the business; 2) overseas expansion efforts falling through due to problems with integration of affiliates; and 3) further commoditization in the global commercial kitchen equipment markets. Hoshizaki can potentially be susceptible to disruptive changes in the market with low cost competition, thus making it difficult to attain premium pricing from brand value and prevent customers from changing suppliers due to limited switching costs. However, we believe Hoshizakis scale in its service network and product development capability would still allow the company to maintain its wide moat in Japan. Nevertheless, Hoshizaki will need to mitigate these risks by strengthening its moat source, integrating overseas businesses, and developing new products suited to the post-pandemic world.","We assess Hoshizakis Capital Allocation Rating as Standard, as we have been seeing signs of an improvement. In our previous stewardship methodology, we gave the company a poor rating, after considering issues surrounding its overseas business as well as effects from poor governance resulting in an accounting scandal. With a prolonged deflationary environment and an aging population in Japan, Hoshizaki has been expanding its overseas business through organic and inorganic means. The company recognized consecutive goodwill write-downs from overseas affiliates in its Americas or Europe/Asia businesses (depending on the year) for four consecutive years between 2014 and 2017. While we think this showed poor capital allocation in the past, we think the companys latest investment in Turkey-based Ozti will allow the company to expand its business in the Middle East. The company plans to increase its dividend payout ratio from a historical 10-year average of 29% to 41% in fiscal 2022, and maintain payout ratio of above 40% over the medium term. We think this is a display of Standard capital allocation, especially given Hoshizakis strong cash balance and zero debt levels, and shows some improvement compared with past levels. However, we do not see this as exemplary, as a shareholder buyback would have likely sent a stronger signal to investors that its shares were undervalued, especially after its shares fell strongly at the beginning of the pandemic. At the operational level, we do not see any signs of its leading market share deteriorating in the companys main business in Japan, which makes up about 70% of total revenue, from either poor capital allocation or its past scandal. R&D has been consistent throughout business cycles at about JPY 4 billion (averaging about 1.5% of sales, compared with about 1% by its competitor, Daiwa Industries) and for fiscal 2022, the company plans to increase capital expenditures not only for capacity expansion but also for molding equipment to develop new products, as part of its new strategy to increase sales to non-restaurant-related customers.Overall, we think Hoshizaki has been able to allocate capital effectively when it comes to improving its governance and mitigate reputational risks from its scandal. In October 2018, Hoshizaki delayed its earnings announcement for its September quarter results, due to a scandal related to accounting (such as inflating sales) by its subsidiary, Hoshizaki Tokai. Subsequently, after conducting a series of internal investigations, other accounting issues in different domestic subsidiaries as well as other irregularities in its U.S. business were also identified, which led to a series of reporting delays. While improving its compliance and governance led to near-term increases in costs, failure to allocate capital effectively in this area could have potentially led to increased reputational risks (eventually translating to its competitiveness). Overall, we think Hoshizaki was able to prevent long-term loss in shareholder value by allocating capital effectively to contain the situation. ","Hoshizaki Corporation manufactures and sells commercial food service equipment globally. The companys main products are commercial kitchen equipment, such as refrigerators, ice machines, dishwashers, beer dispensers, hygiene control equipment, drink service equipment, and freshness control equipment. Its products are used in mainly restaurants, supermarkets, cafeterias, and the agro-fishery industry. The company was formerly known as Hoshizaki Electric Co., Ltd. and changed its name to Hoshizaki Corporation in July 2016. Hoshizaki Corporation was founded in 1947 and its headquarters are in Toyoake (Aichi prefecture), Japan.","Hoshizakis financial strength is at healthy levels. The companys lack of debt and high cash balance (about 64% of total assets) shows financial health, partly attributable to its business model where capital expenditure levels remain low at only 1%-2% of revenue for Hoshizaki and its competitors in Japan, and the company has been able to consistently generate positive free cash flow to the firm for over 10 years. We expect the company will continue to maintain its capital expenditure levels at about 2% of revenue in future. The company also has been debt free for the past 10 fiscal years, despite making a series of acquisitions and investments overseas (see economic moat for details). As a result of these factors, the companys cash balance has increased from JPY 81 billion in fiscal 2010 to JPY 240 billion in 2021. In the near term, Hoshizaki plans to acquire 51% share of Royalkitchen, a Chinese commercial kitchen design and construction company, for JPY 2,244 million. We do not expect the future acquisition to have a material impact on the companys financial health.",6465.T,Industrials,673224785920.0,JPX,291700.0,JPY,4713.0,True,1,5144.559427400915,5143.514988380144,1
24/11/2023,Fundamentals Continue To Remain Strong for Americold ,Americold Realty Trust Inc,COLD,4,03/11/2023,Suryansh Sharma,27.84,USD,23/11/2023,33.0,Medium,,Standard,B,03/11/2023,"No-moat-rated Americold Realty reported mixed third-quarter results with strong performance in the warehouse rent and storage segment but disappointing results in the warehouse services segment. The firm reported adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, of $0.32 per share, 10.3% higher than the $0.29 in adjusted FFO during the third quarter of 2022. Core EBITDA, which removes the impact of higher interest expenses and is less prone to quarterly fluctuations, was reported at $144.1 million in the third quarter up 9.2% compared with the $131.9 million in core EBITDA during the third quarter of the previous year. Management has tightened its 2023 AFFO guidance to $1.24-$1.30 per share, which is approximately 14.4% higher than the full-year 2022 AFFO at the midpoint. We do not plan to change our $33 fair value estimate for the company as we incorporate the third-quarter results. The warehouse rent and storage segment of the company continues to perform decently in the current environment. The economic occupancy rate in the companys same-store portfolio was recorded at 84.0%, down 80 basis points sequentially and up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We note that the economic occupancy rate has improved materially on a year-over-year basis, but the physical occupancy rate has moved up only by around 100 basis points. This shows that the utilization rate of the space leased by the company has gone down, and therefore we can probably expect muted occupancy rates in the upcoming quarters.  ","Demand for cold storage is tied to demand for food, which is relatively stable through economic cycles. We expect demand for temperature-controlled storage space to rise, due to consumers increasing desires for greater variety and fresh/organic choices at the grocery store as well as a newfound focus on resilience over efficiency in supply chains. The temperature-controlled warehouse space has rapidly consolidated in the past decade, with Americold and rival Lineage Logistics combined controlling more than 45% of all capacity in the North American market.","A flood of capital from private equity (and other institutional investors) potentially creates overcapacity, puts downward pressure on rents, and depresses capitalization rates. Labor-related disruptions have still not fully recovered coming out of the pandemic, resulting in materially lower margins in the warehouse services business. Cold storage will not benefit as much from the continued adoption of e-commerce as dry industrial warehouses will benefit, since grocery stores will remain the point of fulfillment for most perishable items.",28/08/2023,"Americold owns and operates cold storage warehouses that mainly store perishable food products but also other temperature-sensitive items like pharmaceuticals, florals, and chemicals. The companys main line of business is the warehouse rent and storage segment, which accounted for 79% of the companys revenue in 2022. While these warehouses vary in size and exact temperature, four-fifths of Americolds warehouses are in North America and we consider Americolds facilities as among the best in terms of quality and location. The company provides ancillary warehouse services like flash freezing and picking/packing to serve, attract, and retain customers. The company also has a transportation services segment where it brokers, manages, and operates transportation for its customers. The remainder of the revenue comes from the third-party managed segment, where it operates facilities on behalf of customers who own cold storage space but do not have expertise in operating it. Historically, many temperature-controlled warehouses were independently owned and there was little institutional interest in the space. There was also little speculative development (i.e., development without tenants already signed up) because of the complexity of construction, high initial capital investment, unique requirements of every tenant, and the modest growth profile of the industry. Recently, though, many deep-pocketed institutions have entered the spacemost prominently, Bay Grove Capital-backed Lineage Logistics. The warehouse portfolio of the company has been materially impacted due to lower commodity stock levels in the past two years. The warehouse services segment has also been struggling partly because of the difficulties in attracting and retaining workers at cold storage facilities. We expect the occupancy to recover to prepandemic levels in the upcoming years as food manufacturers continue to ramp up production and supply chain issues and labor shortages abate. We think that the company will continue to grow its market share in a rapidly consolidating industry and should be able to achieve high-single-digit net operating income growth in the upcoming decade.  ","Due to the lack of switching costs and the ease of additional developments, we do not believe that Americold Realty has a maintainable competitive advantage. Therefore, we assign Americold a Morningstar economic moat rating of none, which is consistent with the other North American industrial REITs that we cover. We estimate that cold storage facilities represent around 2%-3% of the total industrial market.In 2022, Americold derived nearly 80% of revenue and over 90% of net operating income, or NOI, from the rent, storage, and warehouse services segment. Americolds other two business linesthird-party managed services and transportation servicesoperate with razor-thin margins that are in line with logistics companies, which tend to have around 5%-10% net income margins. Because of these add-on services pricing model of typically being sold at cost plus a fixed service fee and their low margin profile in general, we view these services as largely complementary to Americolds core business of leasing temperature-controlled warehouses and not a major factor in the companys moat rating.Market Dynamics (Supply and Demand):Compared with dry (i.e., non-temperature-controlled) warehouses, cold storage warehouses are more complicated to construct and operatean average development takes five months long and costs 2-3 times more, and they require more operational expertise because specialized equipment and staff are required to keep the facilities at the desired temperature. Even so, the development process for cold storage warehouses is relatively simple compared with other real estate subsectors, and, at the end of the day, these buildings are essentially swathes of open space that are filled with pallets on storage shelves.From a demand point of view, temperature-controlled warehouses are a commodity because we see little evidence that current market dynamics award firms with pricing power. Low switching costs enable Americolds tenants to seek out other temperature-controlled warehouses with lower pricing. If Americold substantially raised rents on a tenant, and the customer determined that cost savings would exceed the all-in costs of moving (and potentially higher transportation costs moving forward), the tenant could leave for another cold storage facility. Even in an extreme hypothetical scenario where one player owned all the temperature-controlled warehouses in an area, or all players colluded on pricing, tenants are not stuck using available temperature-controlled warehouses. Most of Americolds biggest tenants are well-established, multinational food production/distribution companies with deep pockets and ample access to capital. While it is not in their tenants wheelhouse of expertise, they have the ability to buy or build temperature-controlled warehouses.While the main driver of demand growth in the dry warehouse space is the continued adoption of e-commercefor every dollar of sales, it takes approximately 3 times the amount of warehouse space to fulfill an e-commerce order compared with traditional retail channelsthat driver of demand is mostly not applicable to the temperature-controlled warehouse space. Currently, there are few perishable goods shipped via e-commerce other than at-home meal kits (like those from Blue Apron and HelloFresh). Even so, these at-home meal kit companies requirement for space is de minimis compared with the needs of food producers/distributors, and very few of these services have yet found mass-market adoption. If, in the future, items were delivered directly from temperature-controlled warehouses to consumers, we think this would represent a boon to the cold storage industry, since it would necessitate significantly greater demand for space. Although we intend to watch this dynamic closely, there is no evidence to indicate that this will be the case at the moment.We also do not think online grocery ordering will affect the demand for cold storage. When a consumer places an online order for groceries (for either pick-up or delivery), their order is currently fulfilled at a brick-and-mortar grocery store, which is typically located within three to five miles of their target consumer demographic, meaning they are the best located to facilitate an efficient and speedy delivery. In contrast, Americolds warehouses typically are on the outskirts of urban areas, enormous, and generally mixed-use. Therefore, owners of cold storage facilities are nearly agnostic as to the channel from which consumers purchase their groceries. If e-commerce demand reaches a certain threshold, some grocery stores could shift exclusively to delivering groceries to online shoppers. Such a change would have a limited impact on cold storage, which operates further upstream in the grocery procurement process.In our view, the fundamental driver of demand for temperature-controlled warehouses is increased urbanization and general population growth. In addition, incremental demand will come from the desire of companies to build supply chain resiliency into their operations as well as greater consumer appetite for fresher, more sustainably sourced foods (which tend to have a shorter shelf life).We believe the temperature-controlled warehouse industry is not supply-constrained in the long run. Despite how management cites how many of its warehouses are located in key logistics corridorsincluding strategic metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, like Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Seattle, and coastal Californiathe sheer size of warehouses requires them to be on the outskirts of urban areas, where zoning laws are less stringent, and land is cheaper and more abundant. Contrast this with a central business district, where it is much more challenging to secure a plot of land (for greenfield development) or an old building (for brownfield development), in addition to zoning. Thus, players with enough capital can freely enter the industry. The temperature-controlled warehouse space may be especially attractive considering capitalization rates for cold storage have been historically higher than dry warehouses, according to research conducted by Jones Lang LaSalle. As a recent example, Bain Capital and Barber Partners formed a $500 million joint venture in May 2022 to develop 15 Class A cold storage facilities in high-demand markets across the U.S. In our view, development can and will catch up to demand in the long run, from either incumbents like Americold or institutional-backed ventures, and we traditionally view the ability to manage short-term supply/demand imbalances as supportive of a no-moat rating in the REIT sector.Efficient Scale:Efficient scale is the most common moat source for real estate investment trusts and refers to situations where companies are effectively serving a very limited market size and potential competitors have little incentive to enter the market because by doing so, they would lower the industrys returns to below the cost of capital. The heart of an argument for efficient scale would go like this: Given a well-defined market that is effectively served by established players warehouses, the addition of another warehouse will take up market share from the pre-existing warehouses, thereby lowering economic profits across the board. At a glance, it may seem like Americold fits these criteria, due to the relatively consolidated nature of the industry and the capital intensity of building/operating a temperature-controlled warehouse. However, we have a few counterpoints.First, the efficient scale moat source is often awarded to companies in industries like railroads, regulated utilities, communication infrastructure, midstream oil and gas, etc.industries that require massive initial capital expenditures and also have significant maintenance needs. The cost of building a temperature-controlled warehouse, in the high tens to low hundreds of millions of dollars, is comparatively quite small. Second, a common characteristic of industries with efficient scale is they operate in a market that has seen little entry or exit in recent times. The industrial REIT sector, as a whole, has attracted plentiful investment over the past decade. For temperature-controlled warehouses, in particular, speculative development (i.e., development without tenants signed up) has hit a new record. There is something that institutional investors see that elicits their interestand it seems they believe incremental supply will not lower all players returns below their cost of capital. Third, we think that the market size for warehouse space (both temperature and non-temperature controlled) in a particular submarket is poorly defined. Tenants, for the most part, are not tied to a specific locality as long as they can still effectively serve a submarket. In other words, tenants have the ability to mix and match warehouse locations, meaning they are free to move some or all of their operations to another warehouse and modulate the capacity accordingly. Lastly, in industries where the efficient scale moat source is often awarded, there is one or a handful of players that dominate an entire market. For example, in the case of a regulated utility that has a monopoly in a particular submarket, the entrance of a new player would cause these two players to split economic profits. Assuming there is no change in electricity demand, both the incumbent and the new entrant will find it difficult to meet their cost of capital. Contrast this with the dozens of temperature-controlled warehouses in a typical metropolitan area of a couple million people. The addition of another temperature-controlled warehouse will increase competition and push prices down, but the reduction in economic profits will be spread among the existing warehouses (albeit not equally). In the case of the regulated utility, economic profits were cut in half; in the case of a market with a dozen warehouses, economic profits would be cut by a single-digit percentage.Switching Costs:The industrial warehouse space exhibits negligible switching costs, and that is also the case for industrial cold storage. Industrial real estate typically features multiyear space commitments, but cold storage space is typically rented on an as-needed basis, adding some risk but also allowing pricing to recalibrate more quickly. For Americold specifically, 39% of revenue comes from multi-year fixed storage commitment contracts, which have an average lease length of six years. The remaining 61% of revenue comes from space that is rented out on month-to-month leases or on an as-utilized, on-demand basis. We view the mix shift toward fixed storage commitment agreements as a positive development.It is true that, for Americold's tenants, storage costs are quite low compared with transportation costs. For food producers/distributors/retailers, however, there is a natural stocking-up and emptying-out of inventory within one season. For example, during the spring and summer, a food distributor may begin to stockpile turkeys at an Americold facility in anticipation of Thanksgiving. After November, however, most of its inventory would be depleted, leaving it with little left in the Americold facility, and thus the freedom to pick up and leave. And, as a general point, inventory throughput is quite highin 2021, Americold reported average inventory turns of approximately 30 days, meaning an average facility saw 12 entirely different sets of inventory entering and exiting.It should also be mentioned that, as of the end of 2021, 58 of the approximately 250 facilities that Americold operates are termed as production advantaged, meaning they are dedicated to one or a small number of customers and are either connected or located adjacent to customers processing/production facilities. In fact, many of these facilities were often built-to-suit at the time of their customers facilitys construction. Americold operates production advantaged facilities with companies including Unilever, KraftHeinz, and Conagra. Having facilities connected (or immediately adjacent) to the customers production facilities streamlines logistics for the customer. As a result, there are large incentives for Americolds customers to continue to use the connected facility, because the efficiencies that come with connected or close-in-proximity plants vastly reduce transportation costs.However, if Americold hiked rents enough, it would be more economical for the customer to switch to another storage plant as long as the transportation and new storage costs outweigh Americolds rents. Specifically, for customers who have non-connected facilities (i.e., the two facilities are close in distance but pallets would still need to be transported by refrigerated semi-trucks), the marginal cost of driving further to an alternative, cheaper facility is quite low, since a customer had to load, drive, and unload regardless. Lastly, many customers processing/production facilities are in less logistically important and more remote areas, resulting in a larger risk of obsolesce if their customers were to no longer use the facility. Americolds customers know this and can use it as a bargaining chip when renegotiating rentsfor the customer knows it would be challenging for Americold to find a replacement tenant paying a similar amount in rent. We believe these production-advantaged facilities create slight switching costs for Americolds tenants because it creates cost advantages for them; but, we do not believe Americold deserves a companywide moat from switching costs because production-advantaged facilities compose less than one quarter of the portfolio.Conclusion:The cold storage space is niche but provides a vital service for its customerssomething like 96%-97% of temperature-controlled products at grocery stores have spent some time in a cold storage facility. But, any given cold storage warehouse is not too different than another, and we can point to the fact that both Lineage Logistics and Americold have been very acquisitive to show that acquired warehouses can plug in to the current portfolio without too much integration.A quantitative way to assess whether a company has a moat is to compare a companys weighted cost of capital, or WACC, to its return on invested capital, or ROIC. In the case of REITs, though, we adjust the ROIC calculation to use maintenance capital expenditures instead of accounting depreciation to arrive at adjusted ROIC. While our ROIC data is limited because Americold IPOed in January 2018, we calculate that the companys ROIC only exceeded its WACC of 7.2% in 2017 and 2018, and has subsequently fallen below WACC. We expect the adjusted ROIC of the company to remain materially below its WACC over the projected period. To wrap up, we believe that demand for new temperature-controlled warehouse facilities is inelastic in the long run, and we forecast occupancy rates and margins to recover in our explicit forecast. However, we also believe supply will keep pace in an industry where the biggest barrier to entry is capital. Therefore, we are left with neither quantitative nor qualitative evidence to support awarding an economic moat for Americold. ","The cold storage industrys fortunes are directly tied to changes in overall demand for food since temperature-controlled warehouses are a critical component of the supply chain that moves food from farm to fork. Because demand for food is relatively inelastic, this industry is subject to comparatively fewer risks, and cold storage warehouse operators remain resilient even in difficult economic periods. Even though food inventories were lower than before the pandemic in the last two years, inventory levels have recovered sharply in recent quarters. We note that cold storage warehouse commodity stock levels have recovered after every disruption in the food supply chain, be it mad cow disease in 2003, swine flu in 2009, or severe drought in 2013.However, there are a few risks we are monitoring. On the supply side, we view potential overcapacity as a threat to Americold. We expect institutional investors to fund more speculative development, especially in areas with high demographic growth. On the demand side, the rise in e-commerce, online grocery, and at-home meal kits have the potential to increase demand for temperature-controlled warehouse space long term, but the magnitude of its impact remains immaterial at the moment. Additionally, vertical integration within the food industry could result in higher vacancies, but the fact cold storage is not a core competency for Americolds tenants outweighs the potential cost savings and streamlined logistics. Lastly, notable investments in distribution and logistics have been made by the likes of Amazon and FedEx. Their entrance into cold storage could drag down demand since they would have contracted Americold had they not made their own investments.Americold may face ESG risks that would negatively affect its future cash flows. These include properly maintaining the safety of the buildings, paying competitive wages, and accounting for the future impact of climate change. We assign Americold a Medium Uncertainty Rating.","We give Americold a Morningstar capital allocation rating of standard. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We forecast 2023 debt/EBITDA to be 6.4 times and 2023 EBITDA/interest of around 3.6 times. The current level of debt is slightly on the higher side, but we believe the nature of business operations is stable enough to where liquidity and leverage will not become a concern.We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. The current dividend of $0.22 per quarter represented 79% of the company's 2022 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which we think is an appropriate level for a REIT. We expect the dividend to increase over the next few years as AFFO grows at a healthy rate.Americolds management team boasts deep experience in the grocery and supply chain space. CEO George F. Chappelle Jr. assumed the role in February 2022 and has a background in consumer packaged goods. Chappelle most recently served as an executive at Tyson Foods and was also the chairman of Agro Merchants until Americold acquired it in late 2020. The previous CEO of Americold, Fred Boehlerwho joined the firm in 2013 as the firms chief operating officer and was promoted to CEO in 2015was terminated without cause in November 2021, and Chappelle was subsequently appointed as interim CEO. Boehler presided over a successful period for Americold that has included going public, international expansion, and major acquisitions. Highlights from this period include a $26 million investment for a 15% stake in SuperFrio (a temperature-controlled warehouse operator in Brazil) in March 2020 and the acquisition of Agro Merchants Group for $1.74 billion in cash and stock in December 2020. Agro Merchants was Americolds largest acquisition to date, and it further expanded Americolds international presence. As a result of these initiatives, concentration among Americolds current top 25 customers has declined recently, going from 60% of the total warehouse segments revenue in 2019, to 55% in 2020 and 49% in 2021.The company has been able to combine its strategy of pursuing internal expansion, ground-up development, and acquisitions to achieve growth in the cold storage industry. The ancillary services that it provides, while largely featuring a low margin profile, are a nice complement to the core rental business that seems to boost long-term relationships with key clients. Americold will likely find it more difficult to find acquisition targets that are accretive to earnings in the face of increased competition from institutional money and higher financing costs from rising interest rates. Americolds biggest competitor, Lineage Logistics, was founded in 2012 by two former Morgan Stanley bankers and has the backing of Bay Grove Capital. By being highly acquisitive, Lineage Logistics has ascended to controlling the largest market share of temperature-controlled warehouses in North America. But Lineage Logistics is hardly the only party looking to make M&A moves.However, Americold likely has one of the largest and strongest expansion/development pipelines among its peers. NOI yields from development are typically higher, but we recognize development also comes with higher risk. Historically speaking, Americold does a lower volume of development compared with acquisitions.In general, we would view Americolds acquisitions, expansions, and developments as value-neutral. Americolds acquisitions typically have NOI yields in the neighborhood of 6%-7%, which is in line with our estimate of portfoliowide NOI yield for Americold. The NOI yields for expansion and development projects at stabilization are slightly higher than the acquisition yields. However, all things equal, expansion and development projects also carry a higher risk than acquisitions. Therefore, a higher NOI yield is needed to compensate for the higher risks associated with development.","Americold Realty Trust Inc is the world's second-largest owner and operator of temperature-controlled warehouses behind privately held Lineage Logistics. The Atlanta, Georgia-based firm owns and operates approximately 240 temperature-controlled warehouses, spanning 1.4 billion cubic feet. In 2021, the firm derived about 79% of its revenue from the United States but also has sizable operations in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Americold supplements its core business by providing supply management and transportation services to its various customers. It operates as a real estate investment trust.","Americolds balance sheet has worsened over the past years, but we still view it as acceptable. As a result of the recent buying spree, the company holds nearly $0.9 billion of intangible assets and more than $1 billion of goodwill (compared with $8.1 billion in total assets). However, between the cash on the balance sheet and the undrawn portion of its revolving credit facility, the company has liquidity of nearly $450 million as of the end of the second quarter of 2023 that can be used to fund working capital, pay dividends, pursue inorganic growth, and invest in organic development opportunities.The company carries $3.6 billion of debt as of the second quarter of 2023, resulting in a net debt/EBITDA of 6.6 times, which we think is reasonable for a REIT with relatively resilient cashflow. Because REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their net income as dividends to shareholders, they often fund expansion through debt. Americold will likely continue to tap into the debt markets as its main source of financing given its continued appetite for growth in an industry that represents a significant opportunity. The weighted average maturity period of its debt is 5.6 years and the maturities are adequately spread. The company was savvy to take out debt in 2020 when interest rates were low. The company had a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% on its debt as of the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, approximately 80% of the debt is at fixed rates, which positions the company well in a rising interest rate environment. All in all, we believe that the leverage used by the company to fund its capital structure is appropriate given the high quality of its portfolio.",COLD,Real Estate,8163401216.0,NYQ,2003775.0,USD,27.84000015258789,True,1,29.394941015802353,27.73467038001852,0
24/11/2023,"Sino American Silicon Shares Cheap, Trading at Over 20% Discount to Listed Holdings",Sino-American Silicon Products Inc,5483,4,09/11/2023,Phelix Lee,179.0,TWD,24/11/2023,227.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,09/11/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimates for Globalwafers, Sino-American Silicon, or SAS, Sumco, and National Silicon Industry Group, or NSIG, at TWD 590, TWD 227, JPY 1,940, and CNY 4.10, respectively, after the common message of a sluggish fourth quarter to be followed by a mild recovery in 2024. SAS is our top pick in the sector as they are best positioned to benefit from incremental semiconductor factories in the U.S. and profitability has been resilient despite the current downturn. NSIG is extremely overvalued in our view as its market capitalization is on par with its larger peers despite being only 25% of the size in terms of revenue, and it is unlikely to generate free cash flow before 2027. Sector commentary is generally cautious. Most wafer producers see either September- or December-quarter revenue as the bottom of the current downturn, citing tepid outlook in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, PCs, and smartphones. This is different from chipmakers comments of a bottoming in consumer devices since silicon wafer inventory adjustments typically lag that of completed chips by six months. Globalwafers, a subsidiary of SAS, is the outlier for suggesting another possible sequential decline in the March quarter, without giving numbers. This is due to Globalwafers unique exposure to silicon carbide wafers, which are affected by a tardy inventory adjustment in automotive customers. Sumco is the only player that provides numerical guidance. It expects fourth-quarter revenue to be flat at JPY 101 billion and operating margin to fall 8.6 percentage points from the prior quarter to 6.4%. Factoring in the Japanese yen weakness, third-quarter results, and fourth-quarter guidance, we increase our 2023 revenue and operating profit assumptions by 2% and 18%, respectively. We leave our long-term forecasts intact. NSIG does not provide guidance, saying instead it will commit to high capital spending for the next few years.","SAS diversified geographical presence gives it an edge in transportation costs.  New semiconductor manufacturing technologies pose ever more stringent requirements on silicon wafers, benefiting leaders like SAS. SAS track record shows strong execution in integrating operations of acquirees.",Chinese entrants like National Silicon Industry Group will limit industry profitability once they scale up 300mm wafer production. Opportunities to acquire small distressed peers have run out as the top five silicon wafer producers hold almost 90% of the market.  GlobalWafers reputation as a leading-edge wafer supplier is not as strong as Japanese peers Shin-Etsu and Sumco.,26/06/2023,"Sino-American Silicon Products Inc., or SAS, has 51% stake in GlobalWafers, which grew to become the third-largest semiconductor silicon wafer producer via more aggressive expansion than peers. It is the only wafer producer to operate factories in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. Such diversified footprint is profitable due to a combination of having customers in all three regions and the firms track record to acquire distressed competitors in previous industry troughs. We view GlobalWafers new plant in Texas as a continuation of its boldness, and it will offer faster and more reliable supply to customers like Samsung and Texas Instruments. We foresee the semiconductor silicon wafer market to grow at 6% per year in the next decade in terms of area and another 2% in pricing coming from more advanced semiconductors. Like other semiconductor companies, wafer producers benefit from demand growth in data centers, artificial intelligence, and automotive electronics. GlobalWafers earnings are volatile like other semiconductor companies. But we expect volatility will be moderated by long-term agreements, or LTAs. LTAs require customers to buy at set quantities and prices and pay deposits in exchange for available capacity. So far, GlobalWafers enjoys some success at enforcing prices, an improvement compared with free-falls in both volume and pricing in previous cycles. We are not overly concerned with Chinese entrants to threaten GlobalWafers. GlobalWafers has close relationships with its customers that are enforced by multiyear preproduction collaborations, which in turns helps the company accumulate manufacturing know-how. Expansion of Chinese entrants is limited by their lack of know-how and geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. For its non-GlobalWafers businesses, we do not expect SAS to divest any of its listed investments. While the investments may lack synergy at first glance, they provide industry intelligence that help the firms to choose the ""right"" innovations to prioritize. SAS started selling green energy to the Taiwan grid in 2022. We see this as a byproduct of its endeavours to reduce energy costs and reliance on fossil fuels. ","We give Sino-American Silicon Products Inc., or SAS, a narrow moat rating supported by intangible assets and cost advantage of its main subsidiary GlobalWafers. GlobalWafers contributes more than 80% of revenue and 85% of EBIT to SAS. It has more than 15% market share in the semiconductor silicon wafer market, behind Shin-Etsu and Sumco. We think SAS moat comes from its manufacturing know-how accumulated over two decades of experience that creates strong multiyear relationships with customers to bring wafers fit for cutting-edge process nodes, supplemented by its unique presence in all three major continentsEurope, North America, and Asia. The moat is likely to endure more than 10 years because customers demand for more powerful chips pushes suppliers to come up with more advanced manufacturing process nodes that are supported by ever-improving quality silicon wafers.New semiconductor process nodes have been introduced every two to three years since the 1970s, each featuring new miniaturization techniques that improve chip performance exponentially. Miniaturization allows more circuitry (analogous to computing power) to be fabricated on chips of same sizes, reducing the margin of error for defects. Hence, silicon wafers have to become flatter, purer, and cleaner. Customers demand a reliable supply of chips (and by extension wafers) made from cutting-edge processes because of their performance that keeps products competitive. For example, Apple is often the first to release iPhones sporting chips made on the latest process nodes, giving it more headroom to introduce new features to improve user experiences. High performance computing (HPC) applications, which includes generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, should drive chip and wafer improvements as they need to handle burgeoning data volumes while minimizing power consumption. In our view, this prolongs the quest for higher quality silicon wafers in the next 10-15 years, allowing industry incumbents like SAS to maintain a lead over competitors old and new.We believe SAS' strength lies in being a first mover in memory-related wafers given its sales mix, and Sumco and Shin-Etsu are renowned for their cutting-edge logic wafers used on chips powering iPhones and the latest AI systems. We estimate about 70% of wafers sold are memory-related and others make up the rest. After excluding the effects of SOI wafers, which are more than 7 times the price of other types of wafers, SAS average selling price, or ASP, is still more than 10% higher than NSIG.SAS has established a reputation as a top-tier supplier and is a go-to partner when customers develop suitable wafers for new process nodes. Based on how upcoming process nodes are communicated, it is safe to assume collaboration between semiconductor manufacturers and silicon wafer producers start at least six years before mass production. Such collaborations are extended only to SAS and a very few companies. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, first acknowledged research of 2nm process node was underway in 2019 and has subsequently said mass production is scheduled in 2025. Newer process nodes require flatter, purer, and cleaner wafers; and multiyear collaborations exist to ensure wafer quality. Because of required collaborations and silicon wafers only account for under 5% of cost of the most advanced semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturers have little incentive to replace wafer suppliers. Even after entering mass production, semiconductor manufacturers are reluctant to change supplier mixes as they rely heavily on SAS and other leading players to secure a stable supply of cutting-edge wafers to keep their facilities as busy as possible.Cost advantage is a secondary moat source for SAS. The company has factories in Asia, North America, and Europe that are close to customers and save transportation costs. Transport cost is estimated at 5% of cost of goods sold and savings can be substantial because international wafer shipping is mostly done by air and additional containers are needed to protect wafers from extreme temperature, humidity, and shocks. First, no-moat Sumco has no factories in Europe, while SAS runs plants in Denmark (neighboring Germany) and Italy that sell wafers up to 200mm in diameter. Second, current Sumco sites in the U.S. only produce two types of 8-inch silicon wafers. SAS, on the other hand, makes multiple types of wafers ranging from 127mm to 300mm in diameter. It also plans to build a new fab in Texas housing a monthly capacity of 1.2 million 300mm wafers. This helps the company capture incremental demand from customers Intel and Texas Instruments, while widening the advantage of faster and cheaper logistics. On the other hand, Sumco has yet to announce any expansion in the U.S. Third, we expect Sumcos overseas expansion plans to be less aggressive, partly owing to the fact that it prefers to do high-end wafer manufacturing at home. Fourth, NSIG has no plants outside of China, so it cannot outcompete SAS on transportation costs even if it gains significant overseas sales.Other than its main asset, GlobalWafers, SAS invests in companies in the semiconductor supply chain. These companies supply to semiconductor manufacturing companies like TSMC and Intel. The company has five other main listed investments, namely Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Company, or AWSC (27.62% shareholding), Taiwan Specialty Materials (30.09%), Actron Technology (22.75%), Crystalwise (33.61%), and Transphorm (8%). AWSC and Taiwan Specialty Materials are consolidated into SAS financials as SAS controls the boards. All but Transphorm are listed in Taiwan and only makes up roughly 10% of SAS market capitalization in aggregate. Among the five, only AWSC has some semblance of an intangible asset moat source based on its know-how in gallium arsenide, a compound semiconductor, a market dominated by Win Semiconductors with just shy of 80% share by revenue. AWSC has 10%-15% market share in the gallium arsenide wafer fabrication market. However, it has not demonstrated consistent excess ROIC over WACC, and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future.Photovoltaic (solar power related) products including batteries, modules, and ingots contributed about TWD 5 billion of the companys TWD 82 billion revenue in 2022. Despite solar-related revenue growing 30% from 2021, we do not expect the trend to continue and do not view the company as enjoying any durable advantage vis--vis Chinese competitors. Chinese players have leveraged government support to drive down costs of manufacturing photovoltaic products, which prevents SAS and other non-Chinese players from competing.SAS has been selling renewable electricity to Taiwans grid since October 2022. This business has no-moat, in our view, as either governments or power grids dictate the feed-in tariff and the companys photovoltaic product segment shows it has no edge in input costs. We believe the renewable electricity segment does not contribute to SAS moat but can forward the companys ESG goals, such as carbon emissions and increasing proportion of renewable energy, and reduce energy cost volatility.","We assign SAS a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. GlobalWafers operates in the semiconductor industry, which is one of the most cyclical industries. Earnings are volatile, with operating margin ranging from 0.1% in 2016 to 31% in 2022.SAS has moderate client concentration risk, with the largest customer accounting for 18% of revenue in 2022. We think this is normal, as it is consistent with the relative size of semiconductor makers such as Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor. Currency risk is limited as most purchases and nonlabor expenses are made in U.S. dollars.Geopolitical risk is not high for the company since its plants are spread across nine countries. It is building a factory in Texas housing a monthly capacity of 1.2 million 300mm wafers, or over 25% of todays firmwide capacity. SAS is exposed to ESG issues like resource use and employee treatment. Semiconductor manufacturing is water- and power-intensive. Taiwan suffers from seasonal droughts, and concerns on electricity supply are also growing amid increasing use from factories. To combat these, its subsidiary GlobalWafers aims to fully transition to renewable energy by 2050, with building its solar power generation facilities as one method. It also installs water recycling tools at its factories. Talent management can be an issue for GlobalWafers. East Asia countries have the lowest birthrates in the world, and attracting foreign workers in the near term can be difficult due to language barriers and immigration policies.SAS competes in the Chinese solar energy supply chain, except for green energy sales in Taiwan. Hardware, like modules and cells, has little differentiation other than price. The industry dynamics somewhat favour newcomers as existing factories are not always compatible with technologies that convert sunshine more efficiently.","We rate SAS' capital allocation as Standard. Its ROIC has been and is expected to be higher compared with its WACC and competitors. The company has its fair share of acquisitions, and most of them have helped GlobalWafers become the geographically diversified giant it now is. ROIC in 2013 to 2021 averaged at 14%, and we project the 2023 to 2027 average to be 19%. We have excluded 2022 ROIC from our averages as it was distorted by a large inflow of customer deposits to kickstart construction of its new site in Texas.SAS' subsidiary GlobalWafers has made five notable acquisitions since incorporation, which we view all to be financially successful, given the companys higher-than-average profitability. The most recent one was on Feb. 3, 2023. GlobalWafers proposes to acquire Shanghai Zhaoye Shenkai Electronics Material Limited, a subsidiary of Crystalwise (4944 TW), for no more than CNY 100 million (TWD 445 million). Zhaoye Shenkai makes lithium tantalate and lithium niobate wafers that are used on wireless and satellite communications. It bought distressed wafer producers SunEdison in the U.S. and Topsil in Denmark in 2016, Covalent Silicon Corp (now called GlobalWafers Japan) in 2012, and U.S.-based Globitech in 2011.SAS spent approximately TWD 3 billion (net of disposals) in building up minority stakes in nonsilicon wafer producers since 2011. SAS consolidates the figures of Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Company, or AWSC, and Taiwan Specialty Materials into financial statements since June and August 2022, respectively, after controlling the boards of directors. It also holds positions in three other listed entities. Given the smallness of stakes, we view access to industry intelligence as preventing complacency in silicon wafers, and this helps SAS act on new developments before competitors.Even though past acquisitions are successful, we caution potential failures coupled with industry downturns may strain the companys balance sheet.SAS dividend payout ratio averages above 60% in the last decade but varies a lot due to solar and semiconductor industry cycles. We assumed a ratio of 65% to be paid out in the coming five years. Free cash flow generated by GlobalWafers should cover its own expansion, and dividends paid to SAS should be adequate for solar-related ventures.","Founded in 1981, Sino-American Silicon Products Inc., or SAS is a holding company specializing in the semiconductor industry. Its crown jewel is its 51% stake in silicon wafer producer GlobalWafers, which was carved out in 2011. GlobalWafers runs 17 production sites in nine countries across Asia, North America, and Europe. Other notable investments include Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Company, or AWSC, and Taiwan Specialty Materials. SAS started selling renewable energy to power grids in October 2022. SAS is headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan. SAS employs more than 8,000 people through its subsidiaries.","SAS has a sound balance sheet. The company's net cash to equity ratio exceeds 30% as of March 31, 2023. The company is not afraid of taking on debt to pursue higher returns, with the net debt to equity ratio exceeding 60% in 2016. It has issued USD 1 billion in convertible bonds to finance its now-lapsed bid for German peer Siltronic in 2021. SAS now owns 13.7% of Siltronic shares through GlobalWafers. We do not see SAS as compelled to sell such shares at a loss, but Siltronics share price movements will affect GAAP profit and book value figures.SAS dividend payout ratio averages above 60% in the last decade but varies a lot due to solar and semiconductor industry cycles.

24/11/2023,"Despite Trimming Some Targets, BP Still Holds One of the More Aggressive Transition Strategies",BP PLC,BP.,3,31/10/2023,Allen Good,473.5,GBP,23/11/2023,560.0,High,,Standard,,31/10/2023,"BP's third-quarter earnings fell from the year before, while failing to meet market expectations, primarily due to lower oil and gas prices and weak gas and marketing trading results. Underlying replacement cost profit fell to $3.3 billion from $8.2 billion a year ago while operating cash flow increased to $8.7 billion from $8.3 billion the year before, due to working capital effects. Production increased 1.3% to 2,328 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year before. BP repurchased $2.0 billion in shares during the quarter, including its $1.5 billion program announced last quarter as well as additional repurchases to offset dilution. Management will maintain the $1.5 billion repurchase rate in the fourth quarter. Gearing fell to 20% during the quarter but remains at the upper end of the peer group range. Despite recent management turnover, BP remains committed to its transition strategy. It reiterated its commitment earlier this month at an investor update where it also increased its 2030 EBITDA targets for its hydrocarbons business and entire company by about 5% and 4%, respectively. Regarding hydrocarbons, it plans to grow production through 2025 and hold that level constant through 2030, excluding divestments, which should lead to EBITDA growth through 2025, as well. Yet it still expects to commit about 40% of investment to its transition businesseslow carbon energy and convenience and mobilityby 2025, leaving its transition in place. Those businesses are projected to deliver over 20% of EBITDA by 2030. This level of nonhydrocarbon investment ranks as one of the highest among its peer group, and concerns over returns on this investment have likely weighed on BPs valuation.","BP is moving early to adapt to the coming energy transition. Its aggressive move away from oil investments should leave it better positioned than peers in the next decade. BP has made great strides in high-grading its portfolio and reducing costs so that its breakeven level has fallen to $50/bbl. New investments break even at $40/bbl on average.  Russia risk and uncertainty about the ultimate value that BP will receive for its stake in Rosneft is overly discounted in the share price, meaning any resolution offers upside.","BPs relative lack of oil production growth leaves it at a disadvantage as oil demand will continue to grow for another decade while current industry underinvestment will result in higher-than-expected prices. BPs targets for rapid renewable power generation growth could result in the company overpaying for assets and destroying value. BP plans to exit its Rosneft holding, but its unclear when or what value it will receive, which could weigh on shares in the meantime.",15/08/2023,"BP previously expected to reduce production by 25% by 2025 and 40% by 2030, but it will now increase production slightly through 2025 and reduce it by about 25% from 2019 levels by 2030, largely through divestments. During that time, it should also improve upstream profitability as higher-margin volumes from major projects come online and costs are reduced. The extended life is a result of greater investment, but not at the expense of the transition businesses, to which BP remains committed. Its ambitious growth plans for renewable generation capacity remain intact, with targets of 20 gigawatts in 2025 and 50 GW in 2030 from 5.8 GW currently. It also plans to double its liquefied natural gas equity portfolio, expand its fuels and lubricants business in emerging markets, sell more food in its retail stores and charge electric vehicles, and develop hydrogen production.  In fact, the change in plans results in only a modest increase in the expected relative earnings contribution of the legacy oil and gas business to 2025 and 2030 earnings targets, since BP increased the anticipated earnings growth from its energy transition businesses as well. Current guidance suggests resilient hydrocarbons will constitute about 86% and 75% of EBITDA in 2025 and 2030, respectively. Thats a few points more than previous guidance, but it also includes the recently acquired bioenergy business and assumes higher oil prices of $70 a barrel compared with $60 previously and adjusts for the loss of Rosneft.  Nonetheless, the tack in strategy should give investors greater confidence in BPs long-term ability to deliver on its targets for earnings growth (12% EBIDA per share CAGR) and returns (18% return on average capital employed at $70/bbl) as it remains leveraged to oil and gas prices for longer than before.","BP does not have an economic moat, in our view, as our forecast for excess returns has become too low and future uncertainty too high. BP has made significant headway in reducing operating costs in its existing production base and capital intensity of new projects so that we forecast it could safely earn excess returns at our midcycle price assumption of $60/bbl. However, the uncertainty of excess returns 10 years from now has increased due to the changing composition of the business and potential level of commodity prices during the next 10 years. We don't have the confidence that BP's plan to transition to a more renewable and low-carbon business will create competitive advantages or that commodity prices will be consistently at levels sufficient to generate excess returns during the next 10 years. As such, BP fails to meet key criteria for a narrow economic moat rating. As time passes and BP demonstrates a high level of competence and execution in these newer areas, or our view changes on commodity prices, we could revise our moat rating. At our current midcycle oil price of $60/bbl, we assume BP can still deliver excess returns with its current portfolio and revised growth plans. After updating our model with the company's revised strategic update, which includes maintaining hydrocarbon volumes around current levels for longer, we forecast higher returns. However, the forecast for excess returns 10 years from now remains highly uncertain, given the large investments in low-carbon businesses and potential for destructive acquisitions. Incremental investment in BPs hydrocarbon portfolio is likely to be value-accretive, however. As part of its energy transition strategy, it is narrowing its hydrocarbon portfolio through divestments as well as more focused investment. Both exploration and upstream capital spending will be well below the levels of the last decade at about $10 billion per year through 2025 and falling to about $9 billion after 2030. Furthermore, this investment will focus on high-return opportunities such as efficient tiebacks, infill drilling, and other near-hub options that leverage existing infrastructure. To earn capital, projects must earn 15%-20% returns at $60/bbl along with an assumed carbon price for operational emissions and have a payback of less 10 years for oil projects or 15 years for gas. Its current set of opportunities averages a payback of five years with an attractive development cost of $10/barrel of oil equivalent. Based on Rystad data, we estimate BPs project queue (sanctioned and unsanctioned) has an average breakeven price of $40/bbl, well below our assumed midcycle price of $60/bbl. Although this would imply BP can safely deliver incremental excess returns, the last decade or so has left us wary. Including the crash in 2008, oil prices have crashed three times. While they quickly rebounded to $100/bbl by 2010, they subsequently crashed again in 2014 due to the oversupply from the emergence of light tight oil in the U.S. This also represented a permanent downward shift in the cost curve and led to the revision of our midcycle price to $60/bbl. As a result of this volatility, BPs cumulative economic profit from 2011 to 2019 was negative. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic caused another oil price crash, which we estimate will result in a negative cumulative economic profit during the next five years even as we continue to assume that oil prices recover to $60/bbl and that the improvement in BPs cost structure holds.Given the oil price volatility of the last decade, the emergence of U.S. light tight oil, which acts as the global marginal supplier that can quickly ramp up or down, and the uncertainty of demand (coronavirus fallout, work-from-home impact, EV penetration, and so on), we think it's reasonable to expect similar volatility during the next decade. This does not imply that prices can only fall. The fallout from currently low prices is also industry underinvestment, which could ultimately result in a global shortage and much higher prices than our $60/bbl assumption. Regardless, however, the excess returns we forecast for BP at our midcycle price are too narrow to instill the necessary confidence that they can endure through the cycle in a variety of price environments; thus our no-moat rating. Our rating not only reflects our concern about commodity prices or BPs hydrocarbon business returns. It is also a function of the uncertainty surrounding the company's strategic shift toward renewable and low-carbon businesses. BP has announced plans to move away from hydrocarbons toward renewable power generation, including solar and offshore wind development and EV charging. Management projects about 20% of BPs earnings will be in energy transition businesses by 2030 and its collective plan (including hydrocarbons) can deliver return on average capital employed of 18%. At this level, returns would safely exceed BPs cost of capital, but we have our concerns. The returns assume $70/bbl oil versus our midcycle estimate of $60/bbl. Also, BPs renewable power generation targets are relatively aggressive as it plans to expand capacity from 4.4 GW currently to 20 GW in 2025 and 50 GW in 2030. Although BP has some prior experience with developing solar projects through its Lightsource joint venture and recently joined Equinor to develop offshore wind, the growth holds execution as well as acquisition risk, given its growth targets. With the focus on growth, BP risks making the same value-destructive investments at the top of the cycle in the renewables sector as it did in the oil sector. Its also questionable whether the renewable power generation business is capable of earning a moat. Power generation is a commodity business, and its unlikely a cost advantage can be earned. Offshore wind likely holds the greatest opportunity for a firm to carve out a cost advantage, given the greater complexity involved in operating in harsher environments, particularly compared with onshore solar. In this respect, firms such as BP could hold an advantage as it can leverage its experience gained from offshore oil and gas developments in harsh environments. Evidence on this transition of experience remains unclear at this point, however. Additionally, development costs for offshore wind are largely composed of elements that offer no opportunity for advantage. For example, turbines are made by many different third-party manufacturers and available to all developers. Costs such as the foundation or transmission to shore are dictated by turbine size and distance from shore, respectively. A firm can carve out an operating cost advantage if it has a large concentration of assets, but there is no barrier to multiple firms achieving this. Returns on renewable generation projects typically are 5%-6% on average. BP plans to lift those to 8%-10% through its operational experience, integration with other parts of its business (trading), and low-cost leverage. Not only has BP yet to consistently demonstrate it can do this, but other integrated oils have similar plans. Arguably, none of these elements are particularly unique, either. BP has operational experience, but little directly in renewable generation development, while low cost leverage is widely available. Its most unique asset is its trading operation, but this is not entirely irreplaceable over time. The rising tide of global renewable power generation is likely to lift all boats over time as private and public customers seek out renewable generation. As such, there are many projects available for bid, each typically offering a contract or power purchase agreement that offers above-market power prices or targets a specific return on capital. These type of contracts can act as an intangible asset supportive of a moat if it results in excess returns. However, industry barriers to entry are relatively lowevidenced by integrated oils' ability to enter a space historically dominated by utilities, not to mention firms like Tesla in distributed generationand available competitive advantages are limited, which is likely to result in more competitors entering the market. As competition intensifies, it is possible the contracted prices or rates of return fall toward the cost of capital in a competitive bid process, reducing the potential for excess returns. The increase in competitors may also mean that governments no longer need to offer above-market rates to secure supply. European countries have already begun to withdraw subsidies that kept prior contract prices above market rates. So while BPs return targets might be achievable, the level of uncertainty on how the market develops at this point prevents a narrow moat rating. A key element of BPs strategy to address the energy transition is to leverage and grow its existing retail assets to charge EVs and sell more convenience items (coffee, prepared food, and so on), but the uncertainty and lack of competitive advantages keep it from delivering a moat. Marketing is already a high-return business for BP, and it expects its expanded strategy to deliver returns on average capital employed of 15%-20% by 2030 as it doubles its retail sites that offer food, grows retail sites in emerging markets sixfold by 2030, and increases its EV charging points from 7,500 to 100,000. We have a relatively high level of confidence in this strategy, given BPs experience and current returns (21% in 2019). However, weve typically viewed the fuel retail business as having no moat because of the lack of switching costs. Our previous research has shown that EV charging actually leads to relatively little energy sold and will likely just serve as a traffic generator for retail sales, not a meaningful source of revenue itself. Also, it remains unclear what the future of EV charging will look like and if the typical roadside location will play its historical role, given the convenience of at home/office/retail charging. BP is exposed to several environmental, social, and governance-related risks, but these have no bearing on our final moat rating as most are too long-term for moat consideration or are not probable or material enough risk to cause material value destruction. BPs primary ESG risk stems from carbon emissions in its operations and use of its products and emissions, effluents and waste generated in operations such as oil spills. The risk from carbon emissions is most likely to materialize through a carbon tax, which increases the price of end products to consumers, reducing demand over time and threatening BPs hydrocarbon business. We expect carbon taxes to gain greater adoption over time but think the impact on hydrocarbon demand remains more than a decade away. Furthermore, BP strategic plans call for a relatively rapid move away from hydrocarbons, which should insulate it to a greater degree than peers from any carbon tax.Oil spills are an ever-present risk for oil companies operating offshore and can be devastating to a firm's value, as BPs Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico shows. While oil companies regularly cause spills, most are immaterial in size and associated fines and cleanup costs are manageable. Meanwhile, large spills such as Macondo are very rare and do not factor into any of our scenario modeling.","BP holds a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating based on fundamental exposure to commodity prices, evaluation of ESG risks, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system. BP's profits and cash flow are largely tied to hydrocarbon production and highly leveraged to movements in the price of oil. Project cost overruns and/or completion delays are continued sources of uncertainty. The company's latest investment strategy calls for divesting a portion of its hydrocarbon portfolio while investing greater amounts in renewable power generation, where it has less experience and returns are typically lower. As such, BPs portfolio could look materially different from our current model in 5-10 years based on the pace of divestments, acquisitions, and investments outside its core business, adding uncertainty to our fair value estimate. BP's 20% interest in Rosneft, Russia's national oil company, creates significant sovereign risk that peers do not have. While BP plans to exit this holding, it now treats Rosneft as a financial asset measured at fair value. This adds uncertainty to our fair value estimate, given the volatility of Russian equity markets and exchange rates. It is also unclear how, when or at what value BP will exit the stake. BP holds several ESG-related risks, but based on our framework, they are not collectively material enough to alter our scenario analysis-determined Uncertainty Rating. ESG-related risks include changes in policy related to climate change such as a carbon tax that could result in higher costs, reduced demand, or stranded resources. Operating in offshore environments exposes BP to the risk of large oil spills that could result in material losses through lost revenue, fines or penalties, or loss of license to operate. BP has a history of large-scale accidents, including the Macondo well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and the Texas City refinery explosion.","Based on our capital allocation framework, which evaluates soundness of the balance sheet, investment strategy, and appropriateness of shareholder distributions, BP earns a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating.Although BP took on debt in the last year to cope with lower oil prices, leverage remains manageable. Importantly, management has made reducing debt and maintaining an investment credit rating a priority. After achieving its initial net debt target of $35 billion, it plans to direct 40% of surplus cash to the balance sheet to ensure it's in compliance with the necessary metrics for an investment-grade rating. Combined with ongoing asset sales, we expect debt metrics to improve in the coming years. All of this amounts to a sound balance sheet in our framework. BP scores a fair rating for its investment strategy, in our view. Its strategy to move away from its legacy hydrocarbon business toward a low-carbon business should help it achieve its carbon-reduction goals and insulate if from a potential decline in oil demand long term. However, we find it is difficult to carve out durable competitive advantages in businesses such as renewable power generation and EV charging while strong competition could weigh on returns. We view BP's decision to extend the life of its hydrocarbon portfolio positively. We rate BPs shareholder distribution policy as appropriate. After it cut its dividend in 2020, management introduced a variable shareholder return model, which is better suited to BPs new strategy as well as for potential commodity price volatility. Its new program calls for dividend growth contingent on the oil price with variable repurchases based on surplus cash levels. This should ensure the dividend remains safe even at lower oil prices while setting investor expectations for returns at higher prices when BP is likely to generate greater amounts of surplus cash. By not steadily growing the dividend unless warranted, BP should avoid the situation it faced in the past where the payout grew to unmaintainable levels over time.","BP is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for, produces, and refines oil around the world. In 2022, it produced 1.1 million barrels of liquids and 6.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2022, reserves stood at 7.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 56% of which are liquids. The company operates refineries with a capacity of 1.6 million barrels of oil per day. BP also holds a 20% ownership interest in Rosneft, which it plans to exit.","BP surpassed its $35 billion net debt target in the first quarter of 2021 and has since continued to reduce debt. As of midyear 2023, net debt stood at $23.7 billion, resulting in a gearing ratio of 21.7%. Management has moved away from an explicit gearing ratio target and is now aiming to maintain an investment credit rating, including the necessary metrics to do so. With its explicit net debt target achieved, it now plans to direct 40% of surplus cash (free cash flow after the dividend) to the balance sheet. It already has realized nearly $17 billion of the planned $25 billion of divestments from the second half of 2020 through 2025. As part of its new strategy, BP has also revised its shareholder return policy to ensure it can maintain investment and payouts amid commodity price volatility. Assuming $60/bbl oil prices, it plans to increase the dividend 4% annually through 2025. However, given the strong commodity price environment, it has announced several increases since the fourth quarter of 2021, including 10% during the second quarter 2023.It will also pay out 60% of surplus cash, essentially free cash flow after dividends, in repurchases. Assuming $60/bbl oil, it plans to repurchase $4 billion annually. However, with oil prices well above that level, BP repurchased $4.5 billion in the first half of 2023 and plans to repurchase another $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2023. BPs debt ratio excludes its Gulf of Mexico liabilities, whose present value is about $7 billion. This liability is scheduled to be paid in $1 billion increments per year through 2032 and will be funded with asset sales proceeds. The present value of these payments reduces our fair value estimate by $2 per share.",BP.L,Energy,79453814784.0,LSE,4066498.0,GBp,466.1499938964844,True,1,490.89609722757905,464.77249108739994,0
24/11/2023,"Stem Makes Progress Toward Profitability, but We Are Moderating Our Long-Term Outlook",Stem Inc,STEM,4,03/11/2023,Brett Castelli,2.66,USD,23/11/2023,3.5,Very High,,Poor,D,03/11/2023,"We have lowered our fair value estimate to $3.50 from $5 for no-moat Stem following third-quarter results. The decrease is primarily driven by moderating our pace of long-term operating margin expansion as we await further scaling of software revenue. We view shares as fairly valued. Stems third-quarter results were largely in line with our expectations. Management slightly lowered guidance ranges for revenue to account for $37 million in guarantees issued related to hardware deliveries in 2022 and 2023. Management remains on track to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2023 after break-even results in the third quarter. The firm also expects to be adjusted EBITDA positive for the full year 2024, consistent with our modelling. On a positive note, management announced further expansion of its backlog, as third-quarter bookings clocked in at over $670 million, nearly 3 times the previous quarter. Stem also announced a new deal with SB Energy to provide its modular energy storage system (ESS) solution across a 10GWh project portfolio. Despite positive steps in the quarter, we slightly lower our long-term adjusted EBITDA margins as we await further scaling of high-margin software revenue. We also update our capital allocation rating to Poor from Standard due to Stem's leverage profile and negative free cash flow. The company is making good progress on reducing inventory levels, but accounts receivable continues to be a large working capital headwind.","Stem is leveraged to the fast-growing energy storage market. The long-term business mix is expected to shift increasingly to software, which garners superior gross margins. The company has historically been a market leader in behind-the-meter storage.","Stems software sales are largely derived from hardware sales today, and the company may be unsuccessful in generating stand-alone software sales. Competition from well-financed battery manufacturers that can integrate software directly into hardware may prove difficult for Stem to compete with. Stem is relatively inexperienced in the front-of-the-meter market, which is a material contributor to long-term financial targets.",03/11/2023,"For much of its history, Stem was focused on providing energy storage systems to commercial and industrial customers, primarily in markets such as California where incentives helped spur demand.  In conjunction with becoming a public company, Stem's business strategy has evolved. Stems financial model has shifted away from prior practice of owning projects on its balance sheet into a hardware and software provider. The company takes a hardware-agnostic view, choosing to procure complete battery systems from third-party manufacturers and attaching its proprietary Athena artificial intelligence software to each sale. Stems long-term strategic focus is on its Athena software; we view the companys involvement in hardware as only to support software uptake. We think over time the company could transition to a software-only provider but do not see this in the near term. Stem recently expanded its market focus to include larger projects in the front-of-the-meter market. The companys history has centered on behind-the-meter installations, but the FTM market is approximately 10 times larger than BTM. We view the companys decision in late 2020 to go public as aiding its FTM sales activities via a larger balance sheet. While we recognize the large size of the FTM market, we think the company enjoys the strongest relative position in smaller, average-size projects with less sophisticated customers. Thus, we expect Stem to achieve lower long-term market share in FTM than it enjoys in BTM. Stem completed its largest acquisition to date with its 2022 purchase of AlsoEnergy, a provider of solar asset management software. Given the firm's limited financial flexibility, we do not anticipate further sizable acquisitions.","We do not believe Stem possesses an economic moat. We base our no-moat rating on the competitive threat of well-capitalized battery manufacturers integrating software and Stems lack of substantial enough market share to justify a network effect. Stem is a provider of energy storage systems to commercial and industrial customers (behind the meter) as well as renewable and storage project developers (front of the meter). The company sells both hardware (up-front sales) and software (10- to 20-year contracts). Stems hardware sales consist of battery systems it buys from third parties (Tesla, LG, Samsung) and bundles with its software to provide a turnkey solution to customers. The core of the companys intellectual property is around its software, and we view its involvement in hardware as only to drive software sales.Given the company does not undertake material value-added activities or manufacture proprietary hardware components, it is difficult to justify a moat for its hardware sales. Further, given margin stacking (Stem sells hardware at a 10%-30% gross margin), we think its hardware is at a relatively disadvantaged cost structure versus competitors. Stems long-term strategic focus is around its Athena artificial intelligence software. To date, the companys software has been sold attached to hardware sales for a bundled solution. We see this dynamic as favoring well-capitalized battery hardware manufacturers that have increasingly looked to build out software management systems (like Teslas Autobidder). We view the companys need to be involved in hardware as indicative that its software does not possess a competitive moat on its own.Stems history is in the behind-the-meter segment, and the company possess leading market share of approximately 30%-35% at present. However, the front-of-the-meter space is much larger (approximately 10 times the size of BTM, according to Wood Mackenzie), and Stem is increasingly targeting the FTM market, but its current market share is negligible (circa 1%). Based on publicly available disclosures from Stem and its competitors, we do not believe Stem has an outsize market share of software-connected energy storage assets at present. As such, we do not believe the company benefits from a network effect. To date, we do not view switching costs as material for customers of energy storage software. Based on our conversations many asset owners (customers) have multiple software providers for solar and storage. We view this as a function of the relatively simple software capabilities needed for energy storage use cases at present. Today, most energy storage assets pull from one to two value streams compared with 13 potential value streams, per Rocky Mountain Institute. As the industry matures, use cases could multiply, increasing complexity and resulting in elevated switching costs for customers of energy storage software.","We assign a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Stem. The company is in the early days of penetrating a nascent storage market, and market development is highly uncertain. The companys software is its core intellectual property, but revenue is minimal today. Additionally, growth will increasingly be tied to the front-of-the-meter market where customers are more sophisticated and Stem will be competing with well-capitalized competitors. The company also has customer concentration risks, with its top three customers contributing 33% of sales in 2021. We estimate Stems environmental, social, and governance risks to be relatively low. The company aims to make a positive environmental impact through deploying energy storage systems, which are often coupled with renewables to lower carbon emissions from the grid. Stem faces risk from product defects that could harm its reputation and prove somewhat material to our fair value estimate, however, we estimate the likelihood is low.","We assign Stem a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Poor based on its balance sheet strength, investment record, and shareholder distribution policy.We view Stems balance sheet to be constrained given outstanding leverage and the company's negative free cash flow. Financial leverage consists of approximately $500 million of convertible notes due 2028 and 2030. We do not think additional leverage would be prudent, given the company's early stage and limited cash flow generation. We assess Stems investment record to be fair while acknowledging its limited history as a public company. We gauge the companys approach to investment as likely to be prudent given its history as a private company with comparatively fewer financial resources. We expect mergers and acquisitions could prove a potential use of cash, with a focus on complementary software capabilities. Organically, we expect investment to focus around investing in the companys Athena AI software.We do not expect returns to shareholders to be a focus for the foreseeable future. Stem is currently burning cash, and we would expect potential future profits to be reinvested in the business, given industry growth opportunities.","Stem is a provider of energy storage systems. The company bundles third-party hardware with its proprietary Athena software to provide customers a turnkey solution. Stem sells its solutions to commercial and industrial customers as well as independent power producers and renewable developers. Its solutions help customers maximize renewable energy generation and help build a cleaner and more resilient grid. In 2022, the company acquired AlsoEnergy, a provider of solar asset management software.","We view Stems financial strength as constrained. The infusion of cash from the special-purpose acquisition company merger and subsequent private investment in public company proceeds initially bolstered cash balances. However, subsequent issuances of convertible notes have added financial leverage. Stem benefits from a long-dated maturity schedule, with maturities in 2028 and 2030. Given the company's early stage and limited cash flow generation, we do not think additional leverage would be prudent. We do not expect large capital expenditure requirements given the company's focus on software and its capital-light model. Regarding long-term contractual agreements, Stem has generally shied away from multiyear take-or-pay agreements with battery suppliers.",STEM,Technology,514456800.0,NYQ,5956867.0,USD,2.6600000858306885,True,1,4.513764712391764,3.047037028967901,1
25/11/2023,"Lowering Our Valuation for KeyCorp, Shares Still Undervalued",KeyCorp,KEY,5,19/10/2023,Eric Compton,12.04,USD,24/11/2023,20.0,High,,Standard,D,19/10/2023,"No-moat-rated KeyCorp reported results that largely met our expectations. Earnings per share of $0.29 came in ahead of FactSet consensus of $0.27 and our own estimate of $0.24, largely driven by lower-than-expected provisioning and a bounceback in capital markets-related fees. Net interest income and expenses were largely as expected. The bank maintained its full-year outlook, and we expect it to meet this guidance, although we see expenses trending toward the high end of ""stable,"" up roughly 1% for 2023. However, the banks goal of keeping expenses stable in 2024 is roughly what we already had in our forecasts, so we did not see any true surprises or negative developments here. The big story with KeyCorp continues to be the pressure on profitability, driven by the pressure on NII. The bank reaffirmed once again the opportunity for NII coming from maturing swaps and Treasuries throughout 2024. We think this will be the most important metric for KeyCorp for the next several quarters. We still think NII has essentially bottomed at current levels and we should see growth throughout 2024. This should help relieve some pressure on the dividend payout ratiocurrently in the 70sand remove some of the uncertainty around KeyCorps core profitability in the current rate environment. Any continued bounceback in capital markets revenue would be a bonus. We did not see any surprises in the Oct. 19 results and do not expect a material change to our $20 fair value estimate. KeyCorp is one of the regional banks currently facing more pressure on earnings, but we think the boost to NII throughout 2024 should help reverse that, and we believe the shares remain materially undervalued.","KeyCorp's valuation is not demanding. As long as the bank can avoid a dilutive capital raise or some other complete disaster, there should be upside in the name. The bank could eventually see extra growth from its digital initiatives or from a recovery in its capital markets segment. Key should have a unique tailwind for its currently depressed NII as certain interest rate hedges roll off through 2025.","There are few positive catalysts left for the banks. Funding costs are running higher, net interest income has likely peaked, higher regulatory scrutiny is likely, and a potential recession may be around the corner. KeyCorp has an odd branch footprint that may be difficult to truly optimize, leading to structurally lower efficiency and less revenue synergies compared with peers. KeyCorp is facing some of the most intense profitability pressure under our coverage, with its dividend payout ratio creeping uncomfortably high.",10/08/2023,"KeyCorp is a midsize U.S. regional bank. The firm has the largest relative exposure to investment banking-related fees among the regional banks under our coverage, is investing in a unique digitally focused retail business (Laurel Road), and has an odd geographic mix, as Ohio, New York, and Washington state are its three largest deposit markets.  KeyCorp was hurt during the financial crisis largely because of its ventures into higher-risk commercial real estate lending in out-of-footprint states. Since the crisis, KeyCorp has wound down most of its construction-related commercial real estate business and refocused on its core corporate banking operations and capital markets services. With increasing credit quality and declining credit-related costs, along with significant operational improvements, KeyCorp has returned to healthy profitability.  The bank's First Niagara acquisition back in 2016 helped improve the bank's operating efficiency and scale. The acquisition improved the bank's deposits per branch and average metropolitan statistical area market share. KeyCorp also gained access to some key new product sets, most notably residential mortgages. Ultimately the acquisition gave the bank some much needed scale, helping to improve operating efficiency.  KeyCorp's latest investments into more technologically forward endeavors, including the acquisitions of HelloWallet, Laurel Road, AQN Strategies, XUP Payments, and GradFin are a bit unique. Laurel Road is a key growth engine for the bank today, using a digital national platform particularly focused on healthcare school graduates. The bank is clearly trying to build out a digital consumer growth platform. KeyCorp is facing more pressure than most peers in the current evironment, as investment fees remain under pressure and the bank's net interest income, or NII, is set to decline. It may be a while before its fee base fully recovers from the current cyclical lows, although we see a natural tailwind for NII as hedges roll off through 2025. While profitability will suffer, we still expect the bank to remain profitable, cover its dividend, and meet upcoming regulatory requirements.","We believe KeyCorp lacks a moat because it does not possess durable cost advantages that are consistent with our bank moat framework. While the companys returns on tangible equity have admittedly improved and now exceed its cost of capital, we still project the bank will tend to be on the lower end of peers, and we'd like to see just a bit more improvement in operating efficiency before we potentially award the bank a narrow moat. We also worry about what happens over the next 10 years as larger banks increasingly push into the middle market. We think KeyCorp has a viable way to defend its turf, but with competition likely only increasing, KeyCorp remains on the edge for us from a moat perspective.We believe bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. We see cost advantages coming from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting. Regulatory costs must also be considered. KeyCorp has historically been a less efficient operator than the best banks under our coverage, averaging an efficiency ratio in the upper 60s. We believe KeyCorps somewhat dispersed branch network, lower deposit market share concentrations, and focus on investment banking have played a role in this. However, the First Niagara acquisition in 2016 has been a very positive step here, and the bank is now on a path to consistent performance in the mid- to upper-50s. That said, KeyCorp maintains an efficiency ratio on the high end relative to the more moaty banks under our coverage. KeyCorp has tended to have a slightly higher cost of deposits than the other banks we cover. This is despite having a better mix of interest-bearing to non-interest-bearing deposits, as KeyCorp has historically had to pay slightly higher rates on its pool of interest-bearing deposits. We dont see this changing and note that First Niagara had a slightly higher cost of funding than did KeyCorp, reinforcing our view that this aspect of the business will probably remain relatively average for the bank.Finally, KeyCorp has not historically been a solid underwriter, generally performing worse than peers through the past several downturns. While KeyCorp did not make it through the 2008-09 financial crisis unscathed, we believe it has been a more conservative lender since that time, having rotated out of the riskier and out-of-footprint construction loans that had hurt it in past cycles. The bank's performance during the pandemic confirms this. Although the bank has tightened up its lending since the crisis, we think the bank will perform closer to the peer median, which is admittedly an improvement, but not necessarily worthy of a moat.We do not view any of KeyCorps nonbanking businesses as particularly moaty. KeyCorp operates a mix of smaller nonbank operations, including wealth and trust management, investment banking, a growing credit card base, and a residential mortgage business. For each of these businesses, scale and reputation tend to matter, and while KeyCorp is competitive, we don't think it stands out enough. We view these segments as good add-on services that allow the bank to adequately provide for its clients and to diversify the bank's revenue streams, but we dont see them as sources of durable structural advantages as of yet. KeyCorp does have a heavier focus on its capital markets offerings and using these services to complement its corporate banking operations. We believe this space fundamentally remains very competitive. Also, for the middle market where KeyCorp focuses, the deal sizes and services rendered dont scale up as much as the large deals done by the truly dominant investment banks. We also wonder how returns will develop over the next 10 years as larger peers look to migrate more into the middle market space, where banks like KeyCorp have historically done well. KeyCorp is seeing good growth for its Laurel Road digital mortgage platform, and while we think the bank's strategy is sound here, we still view these markets as very competitive (digital banking relationships and mortgage origination).From a systemic standpoint, we believe the U.S. offers a fair but improving banking environment. Regulation has become considerably stronger since the crisis, and capital levels have never been higher, though the country still uses a complex and somewhat archaic system of regulation. Furthermore, the U.S. banking market remains relatively fragmented; KeyCorp must compete with a variety of regional and community banks as well as large money center institutions. Our outlook is positive from a macroeconomic and political standpoint. The U.S. is still the world's leading democracy, has increased GDP at a steady pace for years, and maintains the world's reserve currency, all of which contribute to banking stability.KeyCorp is not large enough to be considered a global systemically important bank and therefore avoids some of the more onerous regulatory capital requirements. KeyCorp is large enough to be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests because it has more than $100 billion in assets, but it only has to go through the full process every two years. The bank also avoids extra liquidity coverage and funding ratio requirements. Overall, because the bank avoids much of the extra regulation that larger peers attract, we would view the banks regulatory burden as slightly advantageous. While we do think KeyCorp could benefit from some additional scale, it is small enough to avoid some of the extra costs faced by its largest peers. Further requirements will be triggered if KeyCorp surpasses $250 billion in assets.","We view the macroeconomic backdrop as the primary risk to the bank. KeyCorp's profitability will largely be determined by the interest-rate cycle and the effects of credit and debt cycles, all of which are not under managements control. In addition, the bank is subject to the Federal Reserve's stress test on a biennial basis. Depending on the results of that review, KeyCorp may be subject to capital return restrictions. If required to hold more capital, its returns on equity could be affected. The bank has performed well on the most recent tests, and we would be surprised to see issues here in the future.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors which can come under more scrutiny at times, like gun manufacturers, or energy, for example. Commercials banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint, and governance practices are in line with most companies.We typically assign our U.S. regional banks a Medium Uncertainty Rating, however, due to heightened deposit base, funding cost, and profitability uncertainty, we have raised the Uncertainty Rating for KeyCorp to High.","We give KeyCorp a Standard capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are standard, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. KeyCorp is roughly in line with management's targeted common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.0%-9.5%, and we view the current goal as appropriate. We view the company's capital investments as standard. KeyCorp had its issues during the financial crisis of 2008 with over exposure to certain CRE sectors, however we think the bank has improved its capital allocation since. Not only has the bank greatly improved the risk it takes with its capital, it has undergone value accretive acquisitions as well, notably the First Niagara acquisition which we think helped the bank gain critical scale. The bank has also been a notable investor in digital efforts, notably with its Laurel Road platform, GradFin, and building out its payments offerings. Overall, we think the bank has made much improved capital allocation decisions since 2008. We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. KeyCorp, like most banks, targets a payout ratio for dividends, uses some of its earning to invest back into growth, and any extra capital can be returned to shareholders via repurchases. Now retired CEO Beth Mooney took the helm in 2011 and focused the banks strategy on its core corporate banking and capital markets activity with an eye toward cutting costs and improving operating efficiency. Under Mooney's watch, the bank underwent an arguably transformative acquisition when it acquired First Niagara. The acquisition has largely met or exceeded its original targets and has durably improved overall performance for the bank. While the firm paid a decent premium for what was considered a riskier acquisition given the large size of First Niagara in comparison with KeyCorp, we believe the acquisition made strategic sense and results have backed up the decision. Mooney should be given credit for this. The bank has also undergone an increased focus on its retail operations, as well as improving its internal technological capabilities, with the acquisitions of HelloWallet, Laurel Road, AQN Strategies, and XUP Payments. Mooney retired in May 2020, and she was succeeded by Chris Gorman, who has been with the bank since 1998 in multiple leadership roles. Most recently he was president of banking, where he oversaw consumer, commercial, and institutional banking. Gorman also headed up the integration efforts between KeyCorp and First Niagara. Thus far, Gorman has pushed KeyCorp's digital efforts even further with the national launch of Laurel Road and other bolt-on acquisitions. We like the direction Gorman has steered the bank thus far, and while the bank has come under some earnings pressure in the current environment, we do not see evidence of extreme risk taking and view a capital raise or other value destroying event as unlikely.","With assets of over $170 billion, Ohio-based KeyCorp's bank footprint spans 16 states, but it is predominantly concentrated in its two largest markets: Ohio and New York. KeyCorp is primarily focused on serving middle-market commercial clients through a hybrid community/corporate bank model.","We think KeyCorp is in adequate financial health. The bank performed well through the pandemic, with credit costs being very manageable, and we expect similar performance during the next downturn. While capital adequacy has been an area of increased debate recently, we do not have concerns about capital for KeyCorp. The bank's common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 9.2% as of second-quarter 2023, within management's targeted range and easily exceeding the bank's minimum requirement of 7%. We would expect the bank to have a CET1 ratio, even including AOCI, that exceeds its 7% minimum by mid-2024, ahead of any upcoming regulatory changes (currently set for a mid-2025 start). The capital-allocation plan remains fairly standard for KeyCorp, with a focus on investing in organic growth and extra capital being used to fund share buybacks and pay a dividend. Management targets a 40%-50% dividend payout ratio with much of the rest used for share buybacks if no organic investment opportunities present themselves. Bolt-on acquisitions also remain a possibility.As we model out increased funding costs and other potential strains on profitability, we think KeyCorp's dividend payout ratio will rise into the 80s for the next several quarters. While this is not ideal, the bank is still able to cover its dividend and build up some capital (while also reducing RWAs via some balance sheet management) and our base case is still for the bank to maintain its dividend. In the meantime, we would expect no share buybacks or dividend hikes for the time being as the bank navigates this period of heightened stress on profitability. We expect profitability to improve through 2024 and into 2025 as certain interest rate hedges roll off.",KEY,Financial Services,12377357312.0,NYQ,21070703.0,USD,12.039999961853027,True,1,10.657563546124704,13.958033131392684,1
25/11/2023,Cintas Remains Well Positioned in the Industry and Continues to Grow Strategically,Cintas Corp,CTAS,2,26/09/2023,Joshua Aguilar,554.9,USD,24/11/2023,410.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,26/09/2023,"Wide-moat Cintas reported strong 2024 first-quarter results with growth in all three business segments and in line with our annual forecast. We raise our fair value estimate by nearly 3% to $410 from $400, driven primarily by time value of money and our confidence in the firms growth strategy. We're optimistic given Cintas' long-term focus on margin expansion, new customer acquisitions, and strategic technological investments. However, we still think the stock is overvalued, as it currently trades in 2-star territory. Total revenue for the quarter increased 8.1% year on year to $2.34 billion. We see solid growth across all segments, driven by high customer retention, new business offerings, and aggressive cross-selling sales efforts. The uniform rentals segment posted a revenue increase of 7.6%. Sales for first aid and safety increased 11.3%. The all other segment was up 8.7%, led by the fire protection business, growing at 16.6%. However, uniform direct sales declined by 5.4%. We think this is temporary. The direct sales business has mostly been a consistent sales grower since first-quarter2022, and it successfully recaptured most of its lost sales from the pandemic. We forecast the subsegment will grow at around a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. During the first quarter, moderating inflation forced Cintas to reduce its price increases in line with historical levels, ending several quarters of higher-than-normal pricing. Despite this, increased sales volume and decreased cost of goods sold (as a percentage of revenue) ensured continuous profit growth. Total operating margin increased 110 basis points to 21.4%, marking an all-time high. We expect this figure to improve incrementally as the firm shifts toward a higher-margin business mix. We believe Cintas margin improvements should more than offset the weaker price hikes and maintain high profitability. Clarification: Cintas will be lowering price hikes (in line with historical levels), not reducing pricing.","Cintas industry-leading operating efficiency stems from its significant scale-based cost advantages, achieved through superior route density. The firms impressive sales execution is supporting robust new business wins and greater penetration among existing customers. There is still ample opportunity for expansion, as companies in the sizable unvended market look to outsource their uniform programs and facilities services.","The firms competitors are not standing still, and large providers like UniFirst and Aramark are also growing its routes and pursuing market share.  Since Cintas' core uniform services business is correlated with U.S. employment trends, its operating performance is highly cyclical in nature.  Cintas periodically acquires firms to diversify its business. It is possible the firm will make poor investment decisions and overpay.",26/09/2023,"Cintas is the dominant provider in the $20 billion U.S. uniform rental/sales and related ancillary services industry. It enjoys a roughly 31% market share. It has a diversified customer base of over 1 million large corporations and small and midsize businesses across North America, with no singular customer making up for more than one percent of total revenue. Despite its already impressive position, we expect Cintas will grow over the next 10 years. The firm constantly considers new product lines while emphasizing cross-selling to its existing customers and investing in technologies to enhance customer retention and operational efficiency. About 60% of its annual sales growth derives from new client wins. With a current market penetration rate at below 20%, the remaining unvended market remains sizable. Cintas' first aid and safety segment previously benefited from a high growth of personal protective equipment sales in fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, but as we are now in fiscal 2024 and COVID-19 is under control, the segment is returning to a more traditional level as expected. This is not all bad news, since traditional items like first aid cabinets post higher margins. We project sales in the segment will grow at a 6.4% compound annual growth rate over the next 10 years. We also project an above-industry 10-year CAGR for its core uniform rental segment at around 8%, and a strong CAGR of above 10% for its ""all other"" segment, which includes fire protection services and direct uniform sales. Management has navigated the tough economic environment well over the last year, and cost management has been impressive. Despite the labor shortages that some of its customers are facing, demand remains robust, and momentum seems strong, with more than 11 million job openings in the country.","We assign Cintas overall a wide moat because of cost advantage derived from Cintas route density and economies of scope. Cintas core uniform rental segment maintains a wide economic moat on its own, and it leads the firms growth with the highest margins and return on invested capital.Cintas infrastructure dominates the U.S. with 11,500 delivery routes (in over 330 cities), over 3 times more than Aramarks total of 3,450 routes. Its 461 operational facilities in the U.S. alone are meaningfully higher than UniFirst, which has a mere 260 facilities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe combined. Cintas broad geographic footprint enables drivers to minimize windshield time, or the amount of time spent on the road when traveling from customer to customer. Increased customer proximity allows drivers to maximize the number of customers they serve on a given route, significantly decreasing the cost of transportation, including labor and fuel, which account for around one third of the total expenses Cintas incurs. Consequently, Cintas has over 10% better gross margins than its closest competitors in UniFirst and Aramark.Cintas adeptly targets nonprogrammers, or potential customers that dont yet outsource these services, which makes up 60% of Cintas annual total revenue. Cintas well-established operational model enables it to reach and acquire more nonprogrammers because of its large geographic footprint. Many sales leads are likely stationed on or near Cintas current delivery routes. The marginal cost to serve a new customer is far lower for Cintas with its existing size versus that of smaller competitors. Hence, Cintas maintains superior operating margins of above 20%, which is over 1,500 basis points higher than its closest peer Unifirst. We believe this margin advantage is mainly cost-driven as opposed to benefiting from potential price premium, given that Cintas (alike other industry players) has limited pricing power, because uniforms are largely commodified apparel products with little opportunity for differentiation.We assign Cintas first aid and safety segment a narrow moat based on scale-based cost advantages. Cintas personnel delivers and installs first aid kits and personal protective equipment, or PPE, and comes back to restock and inspect on a regular basis. Like its core uniform rental segment, this workflow requires ongoing customer touch points, which incurs higher labor and fuel expenses. This is where we see the positive effects of route density and proximity to customers spill over to the firm's ancillary business segments. Given its expansive infrastructure, Cintas can earn more profit on its routes by serving each customer multiple products and service lines while saving on transportation costs. The firm has been focusing on customer penetration, creating sales teams specifically designated to upsell to existing customers. Cintas broad range of premium stock-keeping units, or SKUs, like Carhartt and Automated External Defibrillator, allows Cintas to increase sales, while lowering the unit cost to efficiently serve customers. In short, upselling gives Cintas economies of scope.We assign Cintas all other segment, which includes Fire Protection Services (FPS) and Direct Uniform Sales (DUS), a narrow moat. Economies of scope is exhibited here as well, given the sales teams focus on upselling across all business segments of the firm. Moreover, FPS is entirely service based; Cintas neither provides nor installs fire protection systems, only inspects them. Its costs come mainly from compensating inspectors and transportation costs. Its asset-light nature provides ample opportunity for Cintas to increase revenues without much additional cost, strengthening its company-wide cost advantage while maintaining its brand image as a one-stop-shop. However, we acknowledge that competition in this segment is too high for Cintas to earn a wide moat, as most fire protection systems providers offer their own inspection services. For DUS, customers such as hotels and casinos work with Cintas to customize uniforms for staffs. DUS likely shares many operational facilities and delivery trucks with the uniform rental business given their commonalities in dealing with the same materials and supplies. These synergies decrease the average total cost of operations. We think it is very unlikely smaller competitors and new entrants can replicate these distribution efficiencies and displace Cintas. The firm boasts an annual customer retention that hovers around 95%, with many customer relationships enduring an average of over 20 years. Additionally, at about a quarter of its total customer base, Cintas claims even higher customer retention rates (99%) for its national account customers, who typically sign multi-year contracts at a national level, mandating its regional locations to use Cintas' services. Cintas' expansive route infrastructure across regions in the U.S. enables the firm to capture these higher-value customers. ","Cintas' core uniform and ancillary products business is highly exposed to U.S. employment trends. When coupled with the fixed-cost nature of route-based operations (including the need for truck fleets and processing facilities), these factors make for cyclical financial performance. The firm has responded admirably to past recessions, but periods of economic weakness will nonetheless weigh heavily on its top line, while cutting into operating margins. There is still a great deal of uncertainty around the business' resilience amid recent recessionary pressures.Additionally, the uniform rental industry is fragmented and relatively mature, with nearly 600 smaller players other than the big names Aramark and UniFirst. Acquisitions have long been a central component of Cintas growth strategy; the firm acquires local, smaller competitors to expand its customer base and number of routes. Given the large G&K Services acquisition and the fact that additional deals are likely over the long run as the industry gradually consolidates, the risk of overpayment or integration complications will remain a factor.From our perspective, Cintas does not face any material environmental, social, and governance risks that may pose a substantial threat to economic profit at midcycle. The most probable risks surround human capital through wage increases or employee unionization efforts and data privacy and security. Cintas relies on cloud-based software and its transition to SAP software continues. There have been very few issues with SAP over the past few quarters, and we expect this will continue as it concludes the process. With regard to a potential data breach, we believe Cintas is at no greater risk than other firms in the uniform rental space. While a breach is possible, we do not find it probable and therefore maintain a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.","We assess the capital allocation of Cintas as Standard. We believe its balance sheet is sound, its investment strategies are fair, and its distribution strategies are appropriate.Cintas' management team is highly experienced and tenured. Scott Farmer retired as CEO in May 2021 after serving for 18 years and remains an executive chair. Todd Schneider succeeded Farmer as CEO and president and joined the board of directors in June 2021. Schneider has been with Cintas for over 32 years and was previously president and Chief Operating Officer of the flagship uniform rental business segment, which has performed admirably in recent years, while successfully integrating G&K's vast uniform operations. He also had been companywide COO responsible for operations and marketing since 2018. Mike Hansen took over the CFO slot in early 2015 following the retirement of Bill Gale, who held the role for 19 years. Hansen joined Cintas in 1995 and was previously vice president and treasurer.Management has a very respectable record of execution, and we rate its investment strategies as fair. The firm successfully navigated the 2008-09 economic downturn by slashing costs and rightsizing its distribution network to match anemic demand. During the 2009 recession, Cintas uniform revenue was about 5% lower than nonfarm payroll for one year, but it had returned to the 300-basis-point lead three quarters later. In fact, Cintas continued to post positive economic profit in its fiscal 2010 despite the challenging operating environment. Management implemented similar successful measures in navigating the COVID-19 environment as during the Great Recession. That said, Cintas is not without a few blunders. Over the past decade, the company has diversified its service portfolio into new end markets to boost its growth profile, namely document management, first-aid/safety supplies, and fire protection services. However, not all of these forays have performed as planned, as evidenced by its decision in early 2014 to deconsolidate its document shredding operations into a joint venture, which was subsequently divested (fourth quarter of 2015). In general, document shredding is a commoditized business with entrenched competitors, providing few opportunities to differentiate. Cintas paid $4.60 in dividends per share in fiscal 2023, up from $3.80 in fiscal 2022. Quarterly dividend declarations indicate the firm will continue to grow its dividend payout. Given the firm's strong cash position, we believe this is an appropriate use of funds. Cintas scaled back on share repurchases during fiscal 2017 and 2018 due to the large G&K acquisition. Afterward, buybacks ramped back up, with the firm repurchasing about $550 million in 2021 and about $1.5 billion in 2022. Cintas maintained relatively low capital expenditure at slightly over $200 million for the past three years, but has increased to over $300 million in fiscal 2023. During the pandemic, the firm paused growth-related capital expenditures to focus on maintenance-related capital expenditures, like servicing its existing truck fleet. As COVID-19 restrictions completely go away, we project capital spending to increase. Cintas' emphasis on technology investments and its centralized informational technology team implies higher capital expenditures in the upcoming years. These technology investments aim at process improvement to deliver a better and more consistent customer experience, like the MyCintasPortal, which offers 24/7 eService, and a more convenient ordering procedure. As management explains, this is only the beginning phase of its technological transformation. ","Cintas is positioned as a one-stop-shop that rents/sells uniforms and ancillary products and services, such as mops, first aid kits, and fire inspections. In its core uniform and facility services unit (a majority of sales), Cintas provides uniform rental programs for items including but not limited to office attire, custom tailored apparel, flame-resistant clothing, lab coats, and other profession-specific clothing. Facilities products generally include the rental and sale of entrance mat, mops, shop towels, hand sanitizers, and restroom supplies. In addition, Cintas' remaining business includes a first aid and safety services business, a fire protection services business, and a uniform direct sales business.","The industry in which Cintas operates is a cyclical one, yet on a normalized basis, we believe Cintas will more likely than not post positive economic profits over the next 20 years. Adjusted returns on invested capital averaged 19% over the past three years compared with our 8.5% weighted average cost of capital projected average for the next five years. We expect adjusted ROIC will average around 25% over the next five years, assuming improved to steady U.S. employment conditions in our base-case scenario.Furthermore, margins in the core uniform and facility services division consistently surpass the uniform divisions in its closest competitors. In fiscal 2023, Cintas achieved gross margins of over 47%, which is over twice that of Aramark's. Its operating margins are more notable: Cintas maintained superior operating margins of over 20%, contrasted with UniFirst and Aramark operating in the mid-single-digits range. We think this is a reflection of healthy network investment and solid sales execution, coupled with benefits from scale-based cost advantages. We consider Cintas' balance sheet to be healthy. As of the end of fiscal 2023 (ended May 31), the firm has no variable debt. Cintas' debt/EBITDA is 1.1 times at the end of fiscal 2023, versus 1.4 times at the end of fiscal 2022. Management expects continual solid cash flow and is on the outlook for potential M&A opportunities if they are to arise in the years ahead.",CTAS,Industrials,56870043648.0,NMS,278874.0,USD,554.9000244140625,True,0,503.84266213810463,598.0071232493317,1
24/11/2023,"Aurora's Profitability Has Been Improving, but Share Dilution Remains a Threat to Investors",Aurora Cannabis Inc,ACB,4,10/11/2023,Kristoffer Inton,0.63,CAD,23/11/2023,2.4,Very High,,Poor,C,10/11/2023,"Were likely to lower no-moat Auroras per-share fair value estimates of $2/CAD 2.60 by high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentages as its share count grew by a higher-than-expected 9% in its second fiscal quarter. As weve stated before, the continued issuance of equity below intrinsic value destroys value for existing shareholders. We reemphasize our Extreme Uncertainty Rating amid the continued threat of material value destruction. So, while shares trade well below our fair value estimates, investors should understand the material risk in the stock. We think Aurora should be able to survive the much-needed rationalization in the Canadian market, but theres a lot of factors that could affect our prediction. Financial results were slightly better than we expected. While net revenue declined 15% sequentially to CAD 63 million, adjusted EBITDA grew 25% to CAD 3.4 million. This was helped by shift mix as higher-margin medical cannabis (69% of total net sales during the quarter) sales grew while adult use and plant propagation revenue declined. Moreover, the declines in those segments sales are not too concerning, as the drop in adult use reflected the exit from U.S. CBD and the plant propagation was affected by seasonality. Still, its hard to see profitability increase without an acceleration in top-line growth, especially as we think Aurora has likely squeezed as much cost out of the business as it can. Shares were up 17% in after-hours trading, reflecting the low expectations going into earnings. And while our long-term view is unchanged that Aurora can continue to grow profitability and the company has already addressed much of its maturing debt, its continued cash burn amid the still-overcrowded Canadian cannabis market means the risk for dilution remains.","Aurora is now generating consistent positive adjusted EBITDA, so free cash flow is eventual. The need for dilutive share issuances should fall. Cannabis cultivation is complicated, including challenging operational ramp-ups and optimization. Auroras strategic focus on its cultivation operations will help it achieve lower production costs than peers. Auroras international exposure can deliver high-margin sales to help its path to profitability.","Aurora has repeatedly issued equity at a massive discount to our fair value estimate, diluting existing shareholders and destroying value. There's a risk it'll do it again. Aurora lacks a strategic alcohol, tobacco, or pharmaceutical partner that can help it expand beyond simple cannabis cultivation or provide necessary funding when capital market access is tight. The existence of the illicit market limits the potential price increases that Aurora can push through to consumers.",10/11/2023,"Aurora Cannabis cultivates and sells cannabis predominantly in Canada but also exports to the global medical market. It considers itself a medical cannabis company first, as adult use accounts for roughly 25% of net revenue, less than peers. We expect medical cannabis revenue to grow in the high single digits over the next 10 years, with robust international growth offsetting declining Canadian sales. We forecast strong adult-use growth in the low double digits, driven by the conversion of illicit-market consumers into the legal market and new cannabis consumers. Still, we expect medical to constitute most of sales by 2033. The global market looks lucrative, given higher realized prices and the growing acceptance of cannabis' medical benefits. Exporters must pass strict regulations to enter markets, protecting early entrants like Aurora. Continued growth in its medical exports has helped Aurora see volume and price growth even as the Canadian market suffers from price competition. We think the United States will eventually relax federal law to recognize states choices on legality within their borders, unlocking the fastest-growing and largest potential cannabis market, which we estimate will be more than 5 times larger than the Canadian market. At present, Aurora would not benefit from a change in U.S. federal law. Aurora is one of the few Canadian producers with no standing deals with a U.S. multistate operator, although it believes it would be able to draw an attractive partner should the law change. Its 2022 purchase of a majority stake in Bevo allows Aurora to leverage unused greenhouse capacity for noncannabis propagation but otherwise offers few synergies. Unlike some of its peers, Aurora doesn't have the financial backing of a bigger company. This forces it to rely more heavily on equity market access while its peers can rely on the deep pockets of a large partner for capital. This raises the risk of massive equity dilution to avoid running out of cash. Over the shortened fiscal 2023, there were 50% more weighted average shares than in fiscal 2022.","We assign Aurora a no-moat rating. Although there appear to be a few potential sources of competitive advantage through intangible assets and cost advantage, we see several barriers that prevent Aurora from earning an economic moat.We believe the most likely moat source would come in the form of intangibles stemming from regulation. Cultivators and dispensaries require government licenses to operate in every market where recreational and/or medical cannabis is legalized. As a result, companies with licenses could be protected from outside competition, helping establish pricing power. However, this only holds true if limited licenses are issued. The number of licensed producers in Canada has exceeded legal-market demand, weakening the potential competitive advantage and driving price competition.Additionally, we see a few challenges to achieving economic profitability for Aurora. First, given that the cannabis industry remains in the growth stage, investment has outpaced earnings, so profitability remains years away. Although we expect returns to improve as the industry matures, a severe threat of material value destruction remains in the near term.Second, we see governments and the illicit market squeezing cannabis cultivators and dispensaries, challenging consistent positive economic profit generation. With governments on national, state, and local levels reeling from budget problems, the emergence of cannabis as a legal product has come to be viewed as a funding panacea. For example, Washington state has implemented a 37% tax rate on recreational cannabis.All else equal, on the other end of the value chain, consumers would likely bear any government tax increase, similar to the cigarette market. However, the existence of a large and accessible illicit market has effectively served as a price ceiling. High legal taxes have effectively made legal market prices higher, hurting demand.Lastly, we think Canadian licensed producers focused on cultivating and selling cannabislike Aurorahave the least leverage against the government and consumers. The cultivation parts of value chains in other industries rarely have moats, and we see little reason cannabis would be different.Potentially offsetting the challenge of generating economic profit from regulation intangibles, we think that the creation of brand intangibles would help cannabis companies pass the increased cost to consumers, thus protecting their own economic profit. Alcohol and cigarettes are typically highly taxed, but some producers of these products have established strong enough differentiation and brand intangibles that consumers are willing to pay price premiums.However, nearly every cannabis producer wants to create a brand intangible, creating heavy competition. Additionally, Canadian regulation restricts packaging design (limiting visual differentiation), direct contact between the company and dispensary workers (limiting potential strengthening of the sales channel relationship), and advertising to venues in which only adults will be present (limiting ability to capture mind share outside of the dispensary). As evidence that brands are struggling to emerge in Canada, market share has largely been driven by value brands.We think it would be unlikely for Aurora to establish a cost advantage. Given the climate, most cannabis in Canada is grown either in greenhouses or indoors. Although this allows for higher-quality cannabis to be grown, these methods also cost much more because of the required lighting (for indoors) and climate control. Additionally, advantages in greenhouse and indoors can be much more easily imitated than geographic advantages that may be present in outdoor cultivation.","Cannabis producers face numerous risks, largely around regulation. However, Aurora faces additional investing risk relative to most of its Canadian peers, which drives our Extreme Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.The most important risk is the pace and status of legalization, which determines when and where cannabis can be legally sold. Auroras home market of Canada has already legalized recreational cannabis, but U.S. legalization remains uncertain.Aurora acquired CBD company Reliva, which provides some U.S. exposure. However, peers have better U.S. exposure through deals with multistate operators upon a change to federal prohibition. Although there is growing public support for legalization, it is politically divisive, with most Republican support coming only in the form of states rights. This poses a risk for federal legalization and adoption of recreational cannabis.In addition to operational risks, Aurora faces significant financial risk as it has yet to generate positive free cash flow. Unlike its peers that have the backing of deep-pocketed strategic investors, Aurora has higher dependence on capital markets. There is material risk that the company would need to issue incredibly dilutive equity to fund ongoing cash burn. For example, Aurora had to offer dilutive terms to satisfy convertible note holders and issue stock at prices below our fair value estimate on multiple occasions, including a sizable issuance in May 2022.Aurora's biggest environmental, social, and governance risks are around higher taxes and increased regulation, societal and legal acceptance, environmental impacts during growing, and product effects. Higher taxes and increased regulation are the most probable and included in our bear case. Additional risks around environmental impact, a reversal in still-growing acceptance, and product safety are notable but neither probable nor material enough to be included explicitly in our forecasts or affect our uncertainty rating.","We assign Aurora a Poor Capital Allocation Rating based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We view the balance sheet as weak. The company operates in an industry with medium unleveraged business risk underpinned by medium operating leverage and partially offset by low revenue cyclicality. This is compounded by moderate balance sheet risk, as the company carries sizable debt relative to its peers and has yet to reach EBITDA profitability.We see investment quality as poor. Continuing to generate losses and lacking a deep-pocketed strategic investor, Aurora faces an investment handicap. While its Canadian peers have lined up deals with U.S. multistate operators upon a change to U.S. federal prohibition, Aurora remains without exposure to U.S. THC. The acquisition of U.S. CBD company Reliva didn't weaken the balance sheet, but we see little synergy with THC. With regard to its U.S. CBD business, management believed it could play a role when U.S. federal prohibition on THC ends. Although THC and CBD are both cannabinoids, the consumer base and regulatory regimes are so different that we see little synergy between the two businesses. We were proven right as the company exited the U.S. CBD market in fiscal 2023.The acquisition of a majority stake in Bevo was value-accretive as it appears Aurora paid a good price. Bevo is focused on propagating vegetables and other plants outside of Aurora's cannabis focus. Aurora should be able to leverage the underused Sky facility, though we see limited synergies otherwise.We think distributions are appropriate. Given the early growth stage of the industry and the company, Aurora does not pay dividends or repurchase shares. This makes sense, since the young company has yet to hit positive free cash flow and is prioritizing strengthening its balance sheet.Miguel Martin was appointed CEO in September 2020, replacing interim CEO Michael Singer. In February 2020, Terry Booth, who co-founded Aurora in 2013 with Steve Dobler, resigned as CEO because of the company's struggles. Martin has experience in highly regulated industries, including tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and CBD. He had been Auroras chief commercial officer since July 2020 and was CEO of Reliva before it was acquired by Aurora. With Aurora's costs significantly reduced in fiscal 2020, Martin looks focused on expanding its strengths in the value segment to the premium segment.Aurora has developed a plan for achieving profitability with near-, medium-, and long-term objectives focused on optimizing cultivation by lowering costs through mass scale high-tech facilities. Aurora is also investing and leveraging R&D for high-margin products such as CBD infusions, vapes, and edibles in order to create optionality. However, with numerous competitors focused on the consumables market, it is far too early to tell if management has done enough to stand out from the crowd.","Aurora Cannabis, headquartered in Edmonton, Canada, cultivates and sells medicinal and recreational cannabis through a portfolio of brands that includes Drift, San Rafael '71, Daily Special, Whistler, Being, and Greybeard. Although the company primarily operates in Canada, it has expanded internationally through medical cannabis exporting agreements.","While it has been a lingering concern, Auroras financial health is improving. At the end of its second quarter for fiscal 2024, the company had about CAD 76 million of debt, including CAD 28 million of convertible notes, compared with a market capitalization of roughly CAD 275 million. The notes are due in fiscal 2024, with the company continuing to retire them. This has been partly funded by multiple equity issuances, boosting financial health at a massive cost to existing shareholders.Aurora continues to generate cash losses. This is particularly concerning because the company has no major strategic partner backing it. However, since announcing its restructuring program, the company has significantly reduced its cash burn and has reached positive adjusted EBITDA.Aurora's access to debt markets is limited. Consequently, the company has relied on equity offerings to fund its cash needs, leading to significant dilution for existing shareholders. In fact, its share count was 50% higher in fiscal 2023 than in fiscal 2022.Nearing debt maturities while remaining unprofitable creates additional risk for Aurora. There is a wide range of possible valuation outcomes for the shares amid the significant risk of value destruction. If the company needs more cash, it can create a vicious circle, as every issuance makes the next one more destructive.",ACB.TO,Healthcare,299281472.0,TOR,774196.0,CAD,0.6399999856948853,True,1,7.410119045348809,5.557195128460975,1
24/11/2023,Initiating Coverage of Anhui Gujing; Leading Regional Brand Starts To Expand Nationwide,Anhui Gujing Distillery Co Ltd,000596,2,30/10/2023,Jennifer Song,260.45,CNY,24/11/2023,225.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,30/10/2023,"Despite current sluggish consumption in China, baijiu companies third-quarter results reflect resilient demand for premium and mainstream-focused leading local brands. Subpremium names witnessed varying degrees of sales pressure. This is largely in line with our expectations, and we maintain our fair value estimates of Wuliangye at CNY 196 per share, Yanghe at CNY 177, Gujing at CNY 225, and Jiugui at CNY 82. We raise our fair value estimate of Yingjia to CNY 65 per share from CNY 61, to reflect a stronger-than-expected product mix upgrade. At the current levels, Wuliangye and Yanghe are undervalued relative to our fair value estimates, while Gujing, Yingjia, and Jiugui are all fairly valued or slightly overvalued. To recap, Kweichow Moutais September-quarter results released last week were slightly disappointing, which we think was due to seasonal factors. We continue to believe China's baijiu sector premiumization remains a long-term tailwind to baijiu distillers. Among the nine baijiu companies we cover, Luzhou Laojiao and Wuliangye are our preferred names currently, offering the best risk/reward, in our view. We believe the two companies strong brand heritage, supreme product qualityas well as extensive distribution network and deepening co-operation with distributorswill continue to fortress their competitiveness, allowing them to generate economic profit in the long run. In line with our expectations, demand for premium baijiu remains resilient, and wide-moat Wuliangye's sales growth accelerated to 17.0% year over year in the third quarter, following a weaker second quarter. Nevertheless, sluggish consumer confidence has led to divergent performances of subpremium baijiu distillerswide-moat Yanghe saw a slower revenue growth of 11.0% in the quarter, compared with 15.7% in the first half, which we think is still decent. Narrow-moat Jiugui's sales, however, have yet to recover, and continued to fall by a sharp 36.7% from a year ago.","Gujing is the only baijiu brand in Anhui awarded the national well-known baijiu designation, with absolute leadership and first-mover status. Despite Anhui province's lower GDP, its economy has expanded strongly, with GDP growth outpacing the nationwide average in the past five years. We think the stronger economic expansion in its home market will boost Gujings sales volume growth and product mix upgrade. Regional expansion is an important driver for Gujing, underpinned by the companys brand heritage and quality product, which should accelerate sales volume growth.","The baijiu sector is more cyclical than other consumer staple industries. Anhui has long been the most competitive baijiu market. Although Gujing has established its leadership in terms of revenue scale and product premiumization, its selling and marketing expenses remain high. Gujing's expansion outside its home market has lagged many of its peers', with a relatively weaker distribution network in the nationwide market. The company will need to invest heavily in marketing and selling to strengthen its brand and deepen penetration in new markets.",30/06/2023,"Anhui Gujing is one of the eight national well-known baijiu brands. Thanks to its strong brand heritage and deep-rooted distribution network in the regional market, Gujing has become Anhuis largest distiller by sales since 2012 and has led the provinces premiumization via sales growth of its flagship premium Gujing Year Puree series, which allows the company to enjoy decent profitability and returns.  Against the backdrop of sector premiumization, we expect the baijiu sectors sales growth in Anhui to outpace the nationwide average, driven by stronger economy expansion. We believe Gujings strong brand awareness, quality products, and extensive distribution network will cement its leadership in Anhui in both sales scale and premiumization, allowing the company to generate economic profits well into the future.  Despite the success in Anhui province, Gujings nationwide expansion has lagged peers. In 2016, Gujing acquired Wuhan Pride Yellow Crane Tower Distillery, which focuses on low-end to midrange products in Hubei province. The acquisition helped Gujing to expand its reach outside its home market. However, the company hasnt yet set up a strong presence in any of the non-Anhui markets, and sales from those markets grew at a three-year CAGR of 11.2% between 2019 and 2022, below the 14.5% annual growth in Anhui province. As of 2022, we estimate sales outside Anhui made up only 33% of total revenue, far below the 55%-60% for wide-moat Yanghe and Fen Wine. We think this reflects Gujings weaker brand strength and distribution network. We expect the company to continue to spend heavily to deepen its penetration into non-Anhui markets in the next five years, with marketing and selling expense averaging 27% of revenue compared with 10%-15% for Yanghe and Fen Wine.","We believe Anhui Gujing has a narrow economic moat. As with its baijiu peers, we believe Gujings hard-to-replicate aged cellar, quality products, and brand heritage have created material barriers for new entrants and competitors. All of this has translated into strong pricing power and high margins for the company, with returns on invested capital consistently higher than its cost of capital over the past decade, despite the government-led crackdown on consumption and economic cycles, as well as COVID-19 disruptions. However, we think fiercer competition in its home market of Anhui province and challenges in expanding nationwide preclude the company from having a wide economic moat. Anhui province is one of Chinas six major baijiu-producing areas, with a history of producing quality baijiu that traces back 1,800-2,000 years to the Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period. As such, brands are numerous, and competition is fierce. Gujing, Yingjia, Kouzi, and Golden Seed are known as the four golden flowers of the Anhui baijiu market, with about 50% revenue market share in the province. Gujing has a leading position in the Anhui baijiu market, with key competitive advantages from its brand strengthits one of the eight national well-known baijiu brands in China and the only baijiu brand in Anhui that was awarded the designationand quality product, which is fermented in its 122 aged cellars with hundreds of years of history. This has allowed the company to premiumize its product toward higher-end markets, while most Anhui local brands are positioned in low end to midrange. In addition, Gujing has a largest distribution network; it controls more than 3,000 distributors, compared with less than 1,000 for Kouzi, Yingjia, and Golden Seed. Its sales growth also outpaced peers. It has been the market leader in Anhui since 2012, with market share rising to 29% in 2022 from just 10-11% in 2011.","We have a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High for Anhui Gujing, as baijiu, a type of distilled liquor, is subject to heavy regulation and the social risks of a reduction in alcoholic beverage consumption, which make it more cyclical than some other consumer staples industries.As part of anticorruption measures, the Chinese government cracked down on official spending on premium baijiu, leading to sectorwide declines in sales and profitability during 2012-14. After a couple of years of market adjustment and the increase in consumer spending power, the baijiu market has resumed its growth momentum, led by premium baijiu. However, if market sentiment becomes irrational, we don't rule out the possibility that the government will suppress spending on luxury goods.We think other risks come from changes in China's demographic structure and the drinking habits of the younger generation, as well as increasing health awareness. Consumer tastes and preferences may shift to beer and wine as well as other alternatives. From a long-term perspective, we expect this preference shift would gradually slow the growth of baijiu consumption as a whole.The key environmental, social, and governance risks for Gujing include corporate governance that is related to its state-owned status, as well as resource use, particularly large quantities of water use. These are generally in line with domestic peers and are captured in our Uncertainty Rating.","We assign Anhui Gujing a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. We think Gujing has been able to invest in its core competency and focus on long-term growth, with a few positive moves driving higher revenue growth as well as margin expansion. These include optimizing the product portfolio to be more focused on premiumization; investing in home market Anhui, with a robust growth outlook underpinned by volume growth and product mix upgrade; and expanding sales into the nationwide market with years of efforts in channel development. We think the launch of its flagship Gujing Year Puree series has been a success; it upgrades the companys product mix toward the higher-end market, with accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion. This positions Gujing well to benefit from the sectors premiumization trend, a long-term tailwind for leading baijiu producers.","Anhui Gujing is one of the eight most famous baijiu brands in China and the largest baijiu distiller in Anhui province by sales in 2022. The company produces rich-flavored baijiu, with a colorful brand story tracing back 1,800 years to the Three Kingdoms period. Gujing is one of the leading players in the midrange to high-end market and enjoys high retail prices and profit margins, with its flagship Gujing Year Puree series contributing 70%-75% of total sales. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Bozhou controls 28% of Gujing.","We think Anhui Gujing is in excellent financial health, with its debt-free and cash-rich balance sheet underscoring its robust financial health. As of the end of 2022, Gujing has net cash of CNY 15.4 billion, which accounts for 52% of total assets. A quick ratio of 1.6 times should mean the company is unlikely to run into financial difficulties even in an industry downturn. We believe Gujings financial health will strengthen further, and we expect the company to gradually increase its dividend payout ratio to 60% in 2027 from 51% in 2022.",000596.SZ,Consumer Defensive,112375447552.0,SHZ,2023338.0,CNY,261.5,True,0,270.886541861079,227.19569686696454,0
24/11/2023,Wide-Moat Coca-Cola Femsa Poised to Expand with Acquisitions and Diversified Distribution,Coca-Cola Femsa SAB de CV,KOF,4,,Dan Su,85.4,USD,23/11/2023,94.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,C,,No Text Available,"Coca-Cola Femsa can leverage strong retail relationships to drive volume growth in under-penetrated markets across Latin America, tapping soft-drink demand with classic recipes and new products tailored to local tastes. Steady volume share gain in Brazil bodes well for better brand recognition and scale benefits in this large market of over 200 million consumers.  Investments in an internet-based ordering system and cooler placements should help Coca-Cola Femsa better align product planning, manufacturing, and its go-to-market strategy with retailers and resellers in the region.","Lower discretionary spending levels and less-developed transportation infrastructure in Latin America remain hurdles to the bottlers efforts to increase consumption of Coke products. While it's early days compared with developed markets, health-awareness-driven headwinds to carbonated-soft-drink demand will likely gain traction in Latin America and pose a threat to Coca-Cola Femsas long-term growth prospects. Coca-Cola Femsa will continue to wrestle with macroeconomic and political instability in the region, potentially weighing on margins and returns.",31/10/2023,"We award a wide moat to Coca-Cola Femsa. We expect brand affinity from its status as wide-moat Coca-Cola's largest bottler by volume, combined with cost advantages from its massive manufacturing and distribution footprint, will reinforce its durable competitive position and maintain excess investment returns for more than 20 years.  Were constructive on Coke Femsas strategic focus on consolidating Latin American bottling capacity. Pulling back from its global ambition following an unsuccessful foray in the Philippines, the bottler has refocused on its backyard and articulated its intention to pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth, scanning for candidates with untapped growth potential and those complementary to its own footprint. The acquisition of Brazilian bottler CVI was a case in point. The transaction, concluded in early 2022, helped Coke Femsa expand volume share in Brazil to 52% from 48% and bolstered its manufacturing and distribution efficiency in southern Brazil and Uruguay. We expect similar deals in the coming years in the still-fragmented South American market. We also anticipate Coke Femsa will opt to expand its category reach, by adding spirits and snacks to its distributiona logical move, in our view. In this context, Campari and Perfetti Van Melle have already signed up, speaking to the appeal of Coke Femsas network. That said, we expect incremental revenue to trickle in as it takes time for the bottler to accommodate the change with modified distribution routes and schedules.  The firm is not without risks. Operating in nine countries with disparate socioeconomic and regulatory dynamics, Coke Femsa must constantly wrestle with shifting operating conditions (currencies, labor relations, and raw material supply) to achieve its growth objective. Even against this, we expect the bottler to tap its 30-plus years of experience in the region and association with Coca-Cola and parent Femsa to address any challenges (including restrictive regulations and consumer health concerns). Further, we expect no- and low-sugar versions of classic recipes and affordability initiatives to widen its addressable market and soften the volume impact.","We have awarded a wide economic moat rating to Coca-Cola Femsa, based on brand prowess and the entrenched retail relationships afforded by its status as a major bottler for wide-moat Coca-Cola and on the firms association with parent company Femsa, one of the largest retail conglomerates in Latin America. In addition, Coca-Cola Femsa also benefits from significant efficiencies by leveraging its massive scale in manufacturing, distribution, and procurement of advertising services. We expect the company to deliver returns on invested capital (with and without goodwill) above our estimated 9% weighted average cost of capital for more than 20 years. As the largest franchise bottler in the global Coke system (11.3% volume share, versus number-two Coca-Cola EuroPacific Partners at a 9.2% share on our estimate), Mexico-based Coca-Cola Femsa benefits from a durable competitive position underpinned by strong consumer affinity to the iconic Coke brands across Central and South America and by tight relationships with retailers keen to drive traffic and sales with the Coke assortment. The bottlers position is bolstered by Coke brands' unrivaled influence in Latin America (46% volume share in carbonated soft drinks in Latin America in 2022, versus 9% for PepsiCo, per Euromonitor) and the 10-year renewable agreements granting the bottler exclusive distribution rights in authorized territories across major countries including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Columbia to serve 266 million consumers (41% of the Latam population). As a result, Coca-Cola Femsa is well-equipped to tap growth opportunities in this region, where commercial beverage penetration is low (around 50% versus more than 90% in North America) and per capita beverage consumption is one fifth of the level in North America ($190 versus $1,100, per Coke's disclosures). In the past five years, the bottler has withstood a barrage of challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic across the region and severe recessions in Venezuela and Argentina to deliver top-line growth at 5% compounded annually on positive volume and pricing trends thanks in large part to resilient consumer demand driven by loyalty and emotional connection with the Coke brands. Based on Euromonitor data, we calculate that its revenue share in the Coke system in Latin America had expanded 420 basis points from 23.1% in 2017 to 26.7% in 2022. Volume has rebounded strongly on the back of stepped-up marketing and affordability programs following the coronavirus-induced contraction in 2020, with full-year volume in 2022 exceeding prepandemic levels by 11.5%. Over the next 10 years, we expect Coke Femsa to maintain a positive volume trajectory (4% annual growth) by leveraging Cokes innovation pipeline around low- and no-sugar cola products and in noncola categories such as alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and tea. Volume growth should also be aided by accelerated multipack offerings of single-serve bottles under the Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta trademarks that encourage consumer trial and adoption of a wider variety of Coke beverages. Given the aligned growth priority on volume between Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Femsa and lower income levels in Latin America compared with developed countries, price increases (averaging 1% between 2017 and 2021 before the 7% price increase in 2022) have not been the major contributor to top-line growth over the past five years. We dont think this reflects a lack of pricing power, but that the bottler is cognizant of the market environment. We dont expect the pricing strategy to change over the next 10 years, though we forecast slightly higher price growth assumptions going forward (around 2%) on the expectation of steadier demand and more favorable product assortment in South America. Thanks to Cokes brand appeal and an innovative product lineup in keeping with the evolving lifestyle and taste preferences of Latin American consumers, Coca-Cola Femsa has forged close relationships with retailers large and small alike, securing access to prime shelf space and privileges in in-store display and promotions that drive brand recognition and sales. To tap the growth prospects associated with such retail relations, Coke Femsa has over the years built an expansive manufacturing and distribution footprint (49 factories, 260 distribution centers) spanning 10 countries, giving itself significant advantages in ensuring reliable and timely product delivery, which is highly valuable to retailers in a region keen to avoid supply disruptions not uncommon because of spotty infrastructure. In addition, adapting to a highly fragmented grocery retail landscape in the region with a significant share of smaller, less sophisticated retailers (40% share by unorganized trade, per Euromonitor), Coke Femsa has invested in cooler placements in stores for better brand display and an enhanced beverage consumption experience, and invested in dedicated mobile apps and websites to facilitate the inventory planning, ordering, and delivery scheduling for small retailers and resellers. Such initiatives have further bolstered the retail relationships it maintains and should help open more doors when the bottler adds non-Coke products including beer, spirits, and snacks to its assortment in the coming years.On the intangibles side, in addition to the Coca-Cola relationship, we believe Coca-Cola Femsa also operates under the auspices of its parent Femsa (with a 47% economic stake), one of the largest retail conglomerates that operates over 25,000 convenience stores, drugstores, and gas stations across Central and South America. While direct selling through Femsas retail channels has been limited (at 3% of Coca-Cola Femsa revenue, per company filings), we believe Coca-Cola Femsa has benefited from its parent sharing rich market and consumer insights gleaned from tens of millions of purchase transactions taking place each year in its retail network. This is particularly useful to the bottler, considering how different market conditions and consumer preferences have been among the countries where it operates. In addition, we believe Coke Femsas entry into new markets, such as Columbia (51 million consumers), in the past 10 years would have been fraught with problems without its parent Femsa sharing best practices in areas such as government relations, labor laws, and logistics planning. Apart from the intangibles moat source, cost advantages stemming from scale efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution and from procurement savings in advertising services form the second pillar of Coca-Cola Femsas economic moat. With a 2022 revenue base of $11 billion, massive by Latin American consumer company standards, Coca-Cola Femsa is well positioned to maintain high utilization of manufacturing and logistics capacity and to implement time and fuel-efficient delivery routes, which is hard to match by smaller rivals. We believe its manufacturing scale efficiency is a key factor in its ability to maintain stable gross margins in the 45%-46% range over the past five years despite sharp fluctuations in dollar-denominated input costs. While we see limited scope for procurement savings in raw materials including sugar, sweeteners, PET, and aluminum as such purchases have to go through a handful of suppliers preapproved by Coca-Cola in accordance with the bottler agreement, we do expect a $1 billion-plus advertising budget (40% of total selling expense on our estimate) should give Coca-Cola Femsa plenty of bargaining power when shopping for ad agency services. When taken together, we see sufficient evidence to support both brand intangibles and cost advantage moat sources for Coca-Cola Femsa. While we acknowledge that Coca-Cola controls the brands and concentrates pricing, we believe the symbiotic relationship between Coke and its largest bottler Coke Femsa should incentivize the two parties to negotiate and settle on long-term arrangements that allow the bottler to continue generating excess investment returns over a 20-year time frame, thus our wide economic moat rating.","We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating to Coca-Cola Femsa. Although nonalcoholic beverage demand tends to be resilient through economic cycles, Coke-branded beverage products in Latin America remain vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds given relatively low income levels (per capita GDP at $10,000 in Mexico versus $70,000 in the U.S., per World Bank). In addition to the effect on demand, a weak local economy may also pose a challenge to Coke Femsa through local currency depreciation, which would result in significant commodity cost inflation (sugar, PET, and aluminum) that are all priced in U.S. dollar.Furthermore, with operations spanning nine countries with disparate socio-economic and regulatory environments, the bottler constantly faces changes in rules and policies governing key areas including land procurement, currency control, tax credits, labor relations, infrastructure buildouts, and import tariffs. The rapid degradation of Coke Femsas operations in Venezuela in the mid 2010s served as a good illustration of how much damage the combination of political instability, hyper-inflation, and irrational policies can inflict on an otherwise well-managed operation.Given its massive manufacturing scale, a stable supply of water and electricity is key to maintaining capacity utilization (a particular challenge in Mexico and Brazil). While not yet a major issue, water scarcity looms over the next 20 years and will potentially slow down its pace of capacity expansion.As Latin American consumers become increasingly health conscious, Coca-Cola Femsa also faces the challenge of reducing the health impact of its classic beverages without compromising on the distinct taste thats crucial to consumer brand loyalty. While this secular headwind is at an early inning relative to developed markets in North America and Western Europe, with the bottler already rolling out reformulated recipes to slow the exodus of soft-drink consumers, we dont expect the trend to reverse ahead.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating for Coca-Cola Femsa, based on our view that the company has a sound balance sheet, a fair track record of investments for long-term value creation, and an appropriate shareholder distribution practice with cash dividends. First, we view Coca-Cola Femsa as in good financial health. Its balance sheet is solid, with net debt/EBITDA at under 1.0 times in 2022, and we expect the metric to stay at or below 1 time over the next five years, barring any major acquisition. This, coupled with a solid cash position and steady cash flows to equity over the next five years (high-single-digit percent of sales), gives us confidence that the company is well positioned to weather macro volatilities and to invest for long-term growth. On the investment front, its worth noting that given the 89% voting rights that Femsa and Coca-Cola jointly control, these two major shareholders essentially call the shots on all major decisions. That said, we dont see any evidence that suggests the two companies have intentionally invested to benefit themselves to the detriment of minority shareholders, and we dont expect that will change going forward. Investments to support organic growth mainly involve building new manufacturing and distribution capacity in existing territories and entering new territories where Coca-Cola identifies untapped markets and Coke Femsa deems the entry economically viable. We believe the bottler has executed well on this front. However, the firm has a checkered past in acquisitions of bottling assets, with its botched expansion into the Philippines a notable standout on the negative side. The $688 million acquisition of a 51% stake in Cokes bottling assets in the Southeast Asian country in 2013 was meant to be the bottlers first step in its global expansion, but a lack of familiarity with local consumer preferences and the retail landscape, coupled with sugar taxes and restrictions in sweetener imports in the country, put the firm in a bind that it failed to extricate itself from despite five years of effort. It wasnt until 2018 that Coke Femsa folded its Filipino venture, which struck us as too long to come to that conclusion. That said, we acknowledge the delayed exit could be partially faulted on Coke, which was likely not keen to take back the assets given its goal of minimizing owned capacity. We have a more favorable view on Coke Femsas two sizable deals in Brazil: the 2016 acquisition of Vonpar for BRL 3.5 billion and the 2022 acquisition of CVI for BRL 633 million, which helped Coke Femsa garner a 52% volume share in the largest economy in Latin America. This cemented its dominant position in southern Brazil and provided a good launchpad for its expansion into Uruguay. As larger candidates have been scooped up, we expect future acquisitions will likely feature bottlers of smaller sizes and weaker financials. However, we believe Coke Femsa will remain patient and disciplined in scanning for suitable targets. Coca-Cola Femsa has consistently returned cash to shareholders through cash dividends. Over the next five years, we expect dividend payment to grow in line with earnings growth (mid-single digits), with the dividend payout ratio stabilizing around 70%, which we view as prudent. The company did not return cash to shareholders via buybacks in recent years and has not published any buyback goals. We stick to our view that buybacks create value for shareholders only when executed at market prices below the intrinsic value, and it's not necessary to commit to a fixed-target amount.","Coca-Cola Femsa, a subsidiary of Femsa, is the largest franchise bottler of wide-moat Coca-Cola in unit case volume terms. The company purchases beverage concentrates and syrup from Coca-Cola, which it then processes and packages for distribution through on-trade and off-trade channels, including retailers and food-service providers. Mexico and Brazil make up 80% of total sales for Coca-Cola Femsa, with the rest from other Central and South American countries, including Panama, Guatemala, Uruguay, and Argentina. Parent Femsa and Coca-Cola hold 47% and 28% of economic interests in Coca-Cola Femsa, through nonpublicly traded A and D shares, respectively, while controlling 56% and 33% of the respective voting rights. ","We believe Coca-Cola Femsa has a solid balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to weather macro volatilities and invest for long-term growth. The company had MXN 38 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of September 2023 and good access to debt financing at reasonable rates. Leverage is low, in our view, with net debt to EBITDA (over the past 12 months) below 1.0 time in September 2023. We believe its conservative leverage gives the firm sufficient flexibility should the bottler identify attractive bottling assets to acquire or new territories to enter, as the firm has done in the past. Barring material acquisitions, we expect net debt to EBITDA to stay at or below 1.0 time over the next five years. Following its unsuccessful attempt at expansion beyond Latin America with the acquisition and then disposable of stakes in Cokes bottling assets in the Philippines between 2014 and 2018, Coca-Cola Femsa has returned its focus to its own backyard, consolidating its position in South America by steadily buying up small and struggling bottlers in Brazil and neighboring countries. Factoring in the capital-intensive nature of the bottling operation, we view free cash flows to equity as strong, averaging 12% of sales between 2017 and 2021. The metric narrowed to 8% of sales in 2022, mainly due to a step-up in capital expenditures associated with capacity expansion in South America both for CSD products and for the distribution of spirits and snacks in the region. We don't expect free cash flow toequity as a percent of sales to reach historical levels during the 10-year forecast period given higher investments in capital expenditure and in working capital necessitated by expansion plans in South America. That said, we have modeled the metric in the 7%-8% range of sales on the back of steady margin expansion over the forecast horizon.",KOF,Consumer Defensive,17991507968.0,NYQ,85888.0,USD,85.4000015258789,True,1,78.55424508486941,93.34888627794446,1
24/11/2023,Brookfield Renewable Is Well Positioned To Take Advantage of Current M&A Environment,Brookfield Renewable Corp,BEPC,4,03/11/2023,Brett Castelli,35.73,CAD,23/11/2023,43.0,Medium,,Exemplary,C,03/11/2023,"We maintain our $31 (CAD 42) fair value estimate for Brookfield Renewable Partners following third-quarter results. Additionally, we maintain our $32 (CAD 43) fair value estimate for Brookfield Renewable Corp. We view shares as undervalued. Brookfield Renewable Partners reported funds from operations per unit up 4% year on year in the third quarter. Results were diminished by below-average generation within the company's South American hydro portfolio, which saw generation below the long-term average. We place little emphasis on quarterly generation variations within the hydro portfolio, as we expect these to even out over time. Results were also weighed down by adjustments to the regulated price earned by the company's Spanish wind and solar assets, which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of a wind asset. Brookfield Renewable has committed to invest $450 million in acquisitions during the quarter as it continues to see elevated opportunity levels given the recent market volatility. All previously announced acquisitions are progressing well, with the exception of Origin Energy. Brookfield Renewable recently sweetened its offer for the company, but Origin's largest shareholder, AustralianSuper, deemed it below its estimate of long-term value. A Nov. 23 investor meeting is scheduled to vote on the deal. Despite Brookfield Renewable tracking well ahead of its annual equity deployment targets, we expect the company to remain acquisitive. The current volatility in the renewables market should play to the firm's strengths around capital allocation (Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating). In addition to acquisitions, the company allocated capital to share repurchases in the quarter, buying back 1.5 million shares, its first such activity since 2018.",Brookfield Renewable is well positioned for the global renewables buildout given its diversification.  Brookfield Renewable's strong capital allocation record has generated returns generally above peers'. An investment-grade balance sheet ensures Brookfield Renewable of a competitive cost of capital with peers.,"The company is exposed to emerging-market foreign-exchange risk, which generally constitutes 25%-30% of its cash flow. The large amounts of capital looking to invest in renewable projects increases competition for projects, compressing returns. Brookfield Renewables complex corporate structure creates the potential for corporate governance risks.",04/08/2023,"Brookfield Renewable holds a well-diversified global portfolio of clean energy technologies assets. The company targets 12%-15% returns via a combination of organic growth and mergers and acquisitions. Brookfield utilizes a primarily contrarian approach to M&A. Brookfield Renewables portfolio has historically been heavily weighted toward hydro generation, but that has changed in recent years given outsize growth in wind and solar. Hydro has decreased from approximately 80%-85% of the company five years ago to approximately 50% today. We expect hydro to continue to decline as a percentage of cash flow over time, given relatively limited growth opportunities when compared with wind and solar. Solar has increased to 15%-20% of the portfolio as of 2022 and management has outlined robust growth plans expecting it to be the largest energy source in the long term. In addition to renewable energy assets, Brookfield Renewable expanded its investment scope in 2022 to include broader energy transition asset classes. These include novel areas such as carbon capture as well as traditional fossil fuel and nuclear power generation. Brookfield Renewables geographic focus has historically been on North America and Latin America, but has also expanded in recent years to Europe and Asia. We expect the company to take a largely agnostic view toward geographies, opting to invest where the most attractive risk-adjusted returns are. However, the company has communicated it expects roughly 75% of its portfolio to be in developed markets with the remaining 25% in developing markets over the long term, in order to manage foreign exchange risks.  Brookfield Renewable primarily invests in assets alongside Brookfield Asset Managements private equity funds. This approach brings the benefit of increased scale, allowing the company to pursue larger opportunities, but results in frequent acquisitions and disposals. Management seeks to add value through aggressive cost and revenue optimization. The company was historically primarily an acquirer of operating assets but has added development capabilities in recent years. ","We do not believe Brookfield Renewable has an economic moat. We attribute much of Brookfields ability to earn excess returns to its strong capital allocation record and not an underlying moat source. Brookfield Renewable employs a unique structure in which it invests in assets alongside institutional investors via Brookfield private equity funds. This results in much of Brookfield Renewables growth being tied to mergers and acquisitions as opposed to organic growth. Development of renewable energy assets can be characterized by fierce competition and thin returns above the cost of capital. Potential moat sources include intangible assets via long-term contracts and scale advantages but are reserved for a select few companies, in our view. The industry enjoyed robust returns in its early days as competition was sparse and subsidies were high. However, recent years have seen sharply increased competition and compressed returns. This is coupled with limited barriers to entry, particularly for onshore renewables such as wind and solar, where the average project size and complexity are much smaller than for traditional thermal plants. Brookfields renewable legacy is centered on its hard-to-replicate hydro assets (approximately 50% of 2022 cash flow). We believe hydropower plants have attractive moat characteristics given their long useful lives of about 100 years, relatively low operating costs, and dispatch capabilities in the case of pumped hydro. In addition, new hydro assets are extremely difficult to build given needed regulatory approvals and locational constraints, supporting an efficient scale moat source. We particularly view this as the case for Brookfields North American hydro portfolio, which comprises a majority of its hydro capacity and is concentrated in the Northeast United States. Hydros favorable characteristics are partially offset by greater year-to-year resource variability than wind or solar. We do not believe Brookfields wind segment, which was about 23% of 2022 cash flow, possesses an economic moat. The company has 5.4 gigawatts of assets globally, which we do not view as large enough scale to demonstrate a cost advantage. For comparison, narrow-moat Nextera has 20 gigawatts of wind capacity in the U.S. alone. Brookfields wind portfolio does benefit from intangible assets in the form of contracts with counterparties for approximately 90% of generation in 2022, declining to 80% by 2026. This level of contract coverage should ensure consistent returns for Brookfields wind portfolio in the near term but falls short of garnering a narrow moat rating, in our view.We do not believe Brookfields solar and energy transition segments warrant an economic moat. Brookfield is a relatively new entrant into the solar market, where we see fewer barriers to entry relative to wind given simple construction and smaller project sizes. Brookfields reliance on M&A coupled with our expectation for hydro, its moatiest segment, to decline as a percentage of cash flow over time results in our no-moat rating.","We assign Brookfield Renewable a Medium Uncertainty Rating. As an owner of power generation assets, Brookfields earnings power is largely insulated from near-term fluctuations in power prices by contracts (power purchase agreements). Renewable generation assets are subject to resource variability risk. This is especially true for hydroelectric facilities, which experience the largest variability compared with long-term averages relative to wind or solar. Brookfield Renewable faces foreign-exchange risks with its international operations. Approximately 40% of cash flow is generated in Canadian dollars and euros and managed via foreign-exchange contracts. However, an additional 30% is exposed to currencies in South America and Asia, where long-term hedging is difficult, given high costs. Brookfield Renewables relationship with Brookfield Asset Management creates additional potential risks, in our view. Many of these originate from Brookfield Renewables reliance on Brookfield Asset Management for various services. For example, Brookfield Renewables current structure relies on continued fundraising of private equity funds by Brookfield Asset Management. Additionally, Brookfield Asset Management is the offtaker for approximately 15% of Brookfield Renewables generation. As such, we view the financial position of Brookfield Renewable as affected by the performance of Brookfield Asset Management. Environmental, social, and governance risks for Brookfield Renewable are viewed to be relatively low. Renewables face social risks tied to local community support of renewable projects, but we do not view the risk as very material. Brookfield Renewables relationship with Brookfield Asset Management raises governance questions but is not expected to have a material impact on our fair value estimate.","We assess Brookfield Renewables capital allocation to be Exemplary based on its balance sheet strength, investment track record, and shareholder distribution policy.Brookfield possesses a strong balance sheet, as evidenced by its investment-grade corporate credit rating. The vast majority of its outstanding debt is project-level and nonrecourse to the parent. Available liquidity was $4.5 billion as of mid-2023. We assess Brookfield Renewables investment track record to be exceptional. Brookfield Renewables structure, in which it invests alongside Brookfield private equity funds, results in frequent acquisitions and disposals. This places an increased focus on prudent capital allocation, which we view as a core competency of the company. Brookfield Renewable utilizes a largely contrarian approach in which it seeks to buy assets at depressed prices and add value through cost and revenue optimization. We also view Brookfield's recent expansion into energy transition investments favorably given the large amount of capital chasing renewable energy assets.We find Brookfield Renewables approach to equity distributions to be appropriate, despite its elevated payout ratio. Brookfield Renewables payout ratio was averaged approximately 103% of cash available for distribution over the past four years, in part due to weaker hydro resources than expected. We expect the companys payout ratio to decline over time as it increases cash flow per unit faster than distribution growth. The company expects to continue increasing its distribution at 5% per year, the low end of its 5%-9% range, in an effort to reduce its payout ratio. The company employs an opportunistic approach to share repurchases, but this has historically been a limited use of cash.","Brookfield Renewable is a globally diversified, multitechnology owner and operator of clean energy assets. The companys portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, and totals over 20 gigawatts of installed capacity. Brookfield Renewable invests in assets directly, as well as with institutional partners, joint venture partners, and through other arrangements. The company offers two separate listings for investors: Brookfield Renewable Partners LP and Brookfield Renewable Corporation. ","We view Brookfield Renewables financial strength to be sound. The company possesses an investment-grade corporate credit rating, which it views as a competitive advantage relative to peers. Debt outstanding was just under $13 billion as of year-end 2022, with the vast majority nonrecourse to the parent. This is in line with the broader renewables industry, which employs project-level debt to finance a majority of capital expenditures. Brookfield Renewable expects annual equity deployment of $1.3 billion over the next five years. The company plans to finance this investment via a combination of asset sales, debt issuance, and preferred issuance. Brookfield Renewable has historically taken a more restrained approach to equity issuance relative to peers, a positive in our view.",BEPC.TO,Utilities,6747729408.0,TOR,141930.0,CAD,35.81999969482422,True,1,35.645476136886906,36.136829190137796,0

As we digest results, we expect to raise our $1.11 fair value estimate by a high-single-digit percentage, driven predominantly by better-than-expected margin performance, but we continue to view shares as overpriced, particularly after a 21%-22% surge in aftermarket trading. During the quarter, the firm posted its best adjusted EBITDA result since going publicwith a $7 million lossand narrowed its cash burn rate to $19 million from $42 million in the prior quarter. We continue to view the risk of material value destruction as high, with The RealReal engaging two well-known law firms to lead the refinancing of its $175 million in 2025 convertible notes. Our estimates still suggest that equity dilution is likely in 2024, given the firm's already high degree of leverage (debt comprises nearly 80% of enterprise value). With our forecasts calling for another year of declining sales in 2024, we struggle to see the firm achieving its goal of positive adjusted EBITDA in that year, though we do expect losses to continue to narrow. Ultimately, with gross platform sales falling 7.5%, orders per active buyer dropping 17%, and active buyer growth falling to just 1%, we continue to see more reasons for worry than optimism, even with the third quarter's relative outperformance.","Partnerships with Stella McCartney, Burberry, and Gucci should bolster trust in The RealReal's authentication services, addressing a key pain-point in luxury e-commerce. Ballooning acceptance of used apparel purchases and an emphasis on the circular economy provide meaningful secular tailwinds. The RealReal should continue to capture its fair share of growth, as an antiquated offline boutique and pawn shop market is ill positioned to mimic the online resellers platform, authentication, and sourcing investments.","Growth in mobile commerce and younger luxury consumers may favor cheaper self-service marketplaces like eBay, Poshmark, or Mercari. As the first pure play omnichannel luxury reseller, The RealReal is forced to pathfind in its efforts to achieve enduring profitability, the success of which is not guaranteed. Bankruptcy concerns loom in the medium term, with the firm continuing to burn free cash flow and carrying less cash than long-term debt obligations on its balance sheet.",08/11/2023,"The luxury apparel resale space has been chronically underserved, with an inefficient network of brick-and-mortar boutiques capturing the bulk of sales over the last decade. The market that arose from that model was heavily fragmented, bound by retail catchment area, and featured high frictional costs, high commissions, and slow turnovera far cry from other asset classes like cars, homes, and collectibles, which have long enjoyed more effective used marketplaces. The RealReal exists to serve this end market more efficiently, with white-glove inventory sourcing, faithful authentication protocols, and an online platform leading to step-change improvements in platform depth, turnover, and vibrancy. We view the firm's strategy as relatively sound, but recognize that the it will need to get lean quickly to assuage market concerns and service its 2025 and 2028 convertible debt issuances.  The RealReal's principal competitors have historically been offline boutiques and pawn shops, whose geographical boundaries, limited scale, and paltry online presence render them hard-pressed to profitably provide the high-touch auxiliary services that The RealReal specializes in. With trust representing the largest impediment to e-commerce adoption in the channel, and with marketplaces network effects coalescing around breadth of selection, price, and inventory turnover, we surmise that The RealReal's position will prove all but insurmountable for brick-and-mortar incumbents, with boutiques poised to fade into obsolescence, like the corner video store of yesteryear.  More concerningly, we've seen an uptick in luxury resale interest by stronger online competitors like narrow-moat eBay, Poshmark, and even luxury brands themselves, which we foresee creating greater ripples in the competitive environment for The RealReal. While we understand the necessity of the firm's pivot toward more profitable growth over the past few quarters, we've grown increasingly cautious regarding its future prospects, with cuts to marketing and its direct sales business driving progress toward profitability and cash flow breakeven, but opening up the door to encroachment by better-capitalized competitors.","The clothing resale space is dynamic, quickly growing, and suddenly very crowded, with operators competing for exclusive rights to one of a panoply of micro-niches. The $17 billion online domestic market (in 2022, per a ThredUp and GlobalData report) is sliced up by some combination of inventory assortment, service level, geography, and fulfillment channel, with frequent overlap across platforms significantly muddying our line of sight as to who emerges from the maelstrom with the rights to a viable business model and (potentially) excess returns. One thing has become increasingly clear to us, howeverwhile specialized marketplaces have arisen around advantaged niches (wide-moat Etsy in home-made crafts, Reverb in musical instrument resale, or narrow-moat eBay in non-new, collectible goods), some form of consolidation will be required to achieve ongoing profitability, with rampant multi-homing and often irrational price competition likely to persist only as long as investor appetite to fund unprofitable growth remains steady. In our view, durable competitive advantages in the space are likely to arise from some combination of exclusive access to supply, privileged transaction or customer data, a durable marketplace network effect, or difficult to dislodge analog moats like auxiliary services, attractively located store networks, or order fulfillment. Quantitatively, moats in this space would be evidenced by returns on invested capital exceeding a firms cost of capital, considered in tandem with relative take rates, market share performance, and customer acquisition cost. In our view, The RealReal (""TRR"" from here on out) has amassed none of these, and while we applaud the firm's recent progress toward profitability, we maintain that a no-moat rating, largely attributable to material near-to-medium risks of economic value destruction.We believe that marketplace network effects are one of the most powerful moat sources in our coverage, with each incremental buyer and seller increasing the value of the network, attracting further platform volume, and generating fixed-cost leverage for the operator (which can be passed on in the form of better prices for services) in a self-reinforcing feedback loop. For sellers, each incremental buyer increases the likelihood that their inventory can turn over more quickly, reducing frictional costs like storage and inventory obsolescence, while avoiding costly markdowns that accrue naturally as inventory ages. For buyers, each incremental seller augments the breadth of inventory on the platform, which is particularly powerful in segments of the market that feature unique inventories. A vibrant marketplace generates strong sell-through, offers competitive pricing, and solves the trust pain point, with operators intermediating critical third-party services like payments, shipping, and authentication, while stepping in to resolve disputes. The marketplace network effect, for all its virtues, is thus by its very nature one of the rarest moat sources in our coverage, naturally equilibrating in a winner-take-all, or at least winner-take-most, state.With that prelude, were reluctant to award marketplace network effect moats until the signs point to the emergence of a clear winnerconsider Grubhubs unlikely displacement in the food delivery business as alternative providers tapped massive greenfield opportunities (narrow-moat DoorDash with independent restaurants) or cross-sold into related adjacent services (narrow-moat Uber with Uber Eats). Further, as we consider the relatively paltry scale of the resale market and its stratospheric growthour forecasts suggest that the global market roughly triples by 2032we contend that it would require more than a little bit of hubris to anoint the long-term winner(s) at this stage of development. Nonetheless, wed be remiss not to take a stab at reading the tea leaves, stacking up operators along the lines of those variables that most clearly suggest (to us) the presence of an economic moat. In our view, the most competitively advantaged companies are likely to generate returns on invested capital in excess of their cost of capital, comparatively strong take rates, proxying for mutual exchange of value, growing or at least stable market share, and competitive customer acquisition costs. We consider those factors for TRR below, but recognize that the firm's competitive position looks increasingly tenuous, with limited funding and a loss-generating model curtailing the firm's ability to invest in its platform during a critical period of industry growth. Considering returns on invested capital, we note that for most e-commerce marketplace operators, the question is effectively existential. Platforms are naturally scalable, with negligible costs for servicing incremental customers, particularly for peer-to-peer operators that dont take control of inventory (and thus dont generate first-party sales). As a result, ROICs tend to be sky-high, often approaching 75%-100% even after capitalizing a portion of research and development costs and marketing expenses. Thus, while the burden of proof is quite a bit higher, ROICs exceeding cost of capital should constitute a minimum threshold for moatworthiness in the space, as we see it. While the equation looks slightly different for TRR, considering recent investments in brick-and-mortar stores, we cite average annual adjusted ROICs of negative 31% between 2018 and 2022, and economic value destruction in six of the next 10 years, as suggestive of a quantiative lack of an economic moat.Pivoting to take rates, we view the per-transaction share of sales that sellers are willing to remit to marketplace operators as a meaningful proxy for value created by the platform, to the extent that those fees dont drive higher seller churn. On this front, TRR stacks up quite well, attributable to its white-glove service, a skew toward in-home sourcing, and authentication processes. TRR generated a net take rate of 36% (suggesting that the firm earns $36 for each $100 of after-return consignment sales on its platform) in 2022, well ahead of privately held Poshmark (18%-18.5%), narrow-moat eBay (18%-19% in the apparel category, inclusive of ads and payments), and the privately held Vestiaire Collective (15%). Critically, TRR hasnt had to change its fees in response to competitive pressure, likely attributable in part to explosive industry growth, which could be interpreted as evidence that the firm occupies a meaningfully differentiated competitive position. This squares with our qualitative assessment of the space, with TRR solving long-term problems in a structurally inefficient personal luxury resale market. As recently as a decade ago, luxury purveyors had few ways to monetize a closet, cumulatively sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of untapped inventory, with pawn shops and boutiques charging massive commissions and generating weak inventory turnover, largely attributable to their captivity to physical sales within their catchment areas. Further, the luxury space is subject to massive counterfeit risk, with ethereal sales prices and gross margins increasing payoffs for successful perpetrators and simultaneously endowing TRRs authentication program with meaningful clout. While scale is required to defray the investments in auxiliary services that TRR has madein-home appraisal and pick-up, cleaning, repair, curation, pricing, shipping, and reverse logisticsthese factors are clearly valued by the market, a view reflected by a commanding take rate spread that strikes us as enduring.Turning to market share, we must be careful not to conflate growth with enduring competitive advantages, but recognize that there exists a certain circularity in marketplace network effect moat sources that strengthen with scaleso neither should we completely disregard the link. As cited above, we expect the resale industry to grow at a 20% cumulative annual growth rate through 2027, with our estimates suggesting an online luxury market size of $9 billion in the U.S. in 2023expanding to $18 billion in 2027 and $25 billion by 2032. We believe that the firm's need to eschew near-term investments opens up the door to more robust competition in the near-to-mid-term (an unfortunate necessity) in a winner-take-most or winner-take-all market, and our expectation for the firm to lose share in the U.S. online luxury resale market over the next decade remain consistent with a no-moat designation.Wrapping up our moat framework discussion, we consider buyer acquisition costs, which (theoretically) diminish over time as breadth of inventory and magnitude of buyer base, in tandem with deepening brand recognition, drive incremental buyers and sellers to the platform organically. While the qualitative underpinning of this pillar is sound, tracking down truly comparable data can be tougher, but we estimate an average of 4 times customer lifetime value over customer acquisition cost between 2023 and 2032, a compelling return on marketing investments and suggestive of a sticky platform (many software firms target 3 times CLTV/CAC, albeit typically in business to business applications). While none of these sources attest to an economic moat on a stand-alone basis, we view TRRs take rate and attractive acquisition costs together as potentially consistent with an economic moat, contingent on quantitative returns catching up over time, but remain skeptical based on the firm's paltry quantitative performance and our forecasts for declining market share. As we see it, the route to durable profitability remains unproven for The RealReal, and we continue to harbor fear that the model isnt tremendously scalable, with its greatest differentiator (high-touch, curated services) ensuring a hefty degree of variable costsauthentication, curation, sourcingwhile sitting in a nascent market with an ill-defined size at equilibrium. Further, we maintain a handful of questions, particularly considering whether the trade-off between self-service and white-glove consignment is truly binary, and regarding the long-term competitive equilibrium in the space, especially should full-price retail sales at luxury brands become pinched by a growing resale market. Investments like Kerings stake in the Vestiaire collective, or Richemonts acquisition of Net-A-Porter suggest awareness by the large fashion houses, whose pricing decisions and competitive response to the resale space will have sweeping implications. ","After considering The RealReal's exposure to broader market risk factors and relatively high gross leverage, in tandem with our quantitative Uncertainty Rating tool, we believe that it merits a Very High Uncertainty Rating.While more affluent luxury clientele are generally resilient during periods of economic turmoil, it looks increasingly likely to us that the RealReal performs more like a resale company than a luxury fashion house during a downturn. Even a modest pullback in sales momentum could delay the firm's route to cash flow breakeven, likely requiring the firm to refinance either or both of its 2025 and 2028 convertible notes series at costly market rates, while a relatively asset-light, cash-burning business model likely precludes access to the conventional subordinated debt market. Exacerbating cash flow uncertainty is intense competition in the resale market itself, with robust growth rates attracting a surfeit of interest from peer-to-peer platforms, rental service providers, consignment outfits like the Vestiaire Collective, and e-tail marketplaces like no-moat Farfetch. Consolidation looks inevitable, and operators that feature extensive inventory, customer, or geographic overlap may experience a race to the bottom on take rates and margin. While we believe The RealReal's model is relatively insulated (with consignment preventing multihoming), but note that blurring lines between self-service and white-glove consignment could pinch The RealReal's addressable market and gross merchandise volume growth over time.Last, considering environmental, social, and governance risks, we believe the most poignant is product governance, with no more than isolated counterfeit sales posing a meaningful threat to platform trust and commensurately to gross merchandise volume and active buyer growth. Authentication services remain mission-critical in the sector, and a lapse in that aspect of the model could catalyze a sharp drop in our fair value estimate.","As we consider The RealReal's performance against the three pillars of our forward-looking capital allocation methodologybalance sheet health, investment efficacy, and shareholder distribution policywe believe that the firm warrants a Poor capital allocation rating. That rating balances a weak balance sheet, poor investment roadmap, and appropriate shareholder returns.Considering each pillar in turn, we view the firm's balance sheet health as weak, despite only moderate cyclicality and no meaningful near-term debt maturities. The firm maintains negative equity, two looming convertible debt principal payments in 2025 ($172.5 million) and 2028 ($287.5 million), and just $171 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Further, near-term capital expenditures don't appear particularly discretionary, skewing toward IT investments and brick-and-mortar store openings, and a relatively high fixed-cost base minimizes flexibility in the event of soft sales figures, corroborating this view. On balance, we expect that The RealReal will likely need to issue meaningfully dilutive equity in 2024, particularly with debt markets remaining frosty. Importantly, capital would be raised at prevailing market prices rather than intrinsic valuation, heightening the importance of market perception of the firm's forward prospects.Turning to investment strategy, we believe that management's roadmap merits a poor rating. While the firm's four categories of investmentsupply sourcing, platform improvements, authentication, and process automationappear strategically cogent, we identify meaningful risk of value destruction through execution, and expect current market constraints to drive underinvestment, with deleterious flow-through impacts for the firm's long-term competitive positioning. Considering the winner-takes-all, or at least winner-takes-most, nature of marketplace network effects, the firm's decision to tighten the belt in 2023, while an existential necessity, increases the risk of competitive displacement by a better capitalized competitor. Consequently, despite our forecast for attractive returns on incremental capital, we remained chastened by heightened risks of economic value destruction in the mid-term. One such example is the firm's decision to close four brick and mortar stores and two consignment offices, which we expect to curtail near-term gross merchandise volume growth.Finally, we consider shareholder returns as appropriate, with the firm eschewing cash dividends and share repurchases during its high growth phase.","The RealReal is the largest luxury resale platform in the U.S., generating $1.8 billion in 2022 gross merchandise volume and addressing a niche (personal luxury resale) that had previously been serviced by inefficient upscale boutiques and local pawn shops. The firm generates revenue via consignment and first-party sales on its online marketplace, and through direct sales across its brick-and-mortar footprint. With a hands-on approach that actively sources inventory and authenticates every item on its platform, The RealReal is able to justify much higher take rates than peers, working out to roughly 35% of net merchandise value, which excludes returns, cancellations, and first-party sales.","We believe that The RealReal's financial health is poor. While we don't believe that immediate bankruptcy concerns loom, with $171 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter of 2023 looking sufficient to fund near-term investments, the firm carries negative equity and continues to burn cash too quickly for comfort ($19 million during its most recent quarter). External financing will almost certainly be necessary, and funding markets remain frosty, suggesting meaningful dilution for equityholders. To this effect, our most pointed concern pertains to the firm's ability to service a $172.5 million principal payment in 2025, with a further $287.5 million payment looming three years thereafter. If necessary, The RealReal could be able to fund that redemption through a combination of equity and convertible debt issuance, and we contemplate meaningful dilution of shareholder capital in 2024 with partial equity redemption now incorporated into our base-case scenario.In our view, between few hard assets and the firm's looming repayment of its 2025 and 2028 series convertible notes, The RealReal will find it challenging to assume conventional debt, reducing management's flexibility to pursue otherwise attractive investment opportunities and raising the stakes for marching toward cash flow breakeven. Otherwise, the RealReal's waterfall of capital priorities strikes us as reasonable: internal investments, international expansion, and shareholder returns.",REAL,Consumer Cyclical,248065024.0,NMS,3105712.0,USD,2.244999885559082,True,0,2.113294118994118,2.271296296593827,0
24/11/2023,ASMPT Provides Diversified Leverage to Semiconductor and Electronics Growth,ASMPT Ltd,00522,4,25/10/2023,Dan Baker,77.1,HKD,24/11/2023,90.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,,25/10/2023,"ASMPTs third quarter was hit by a number of largely one-off factors that negatively affected profitability. The industry also remains toward the bottom of a downcycle and there are few signs yet of a near-term recovery. Third-quarter revenue fell 24% year on year to HKD 3,474 million, with gross profit margin of 34.2% compared with 40.9% in the third quarter of 2022. Net profit of HKD 12.8 million was down 98% year on year. Restructuring costs of HKD 40.4 million, mainly relating to redundancies, were incurred in the quarter. The semiconductor solutions segment also saw gross margin fall to 31.9% (from over 40%) in every quarter for the past two years, due to unfavorable product mix and provision for aging inventories. Management is guiding to a return to gross profit margins of around 40% for the semiconductor solutions segment in the fourth quarter, despite forecasting broadly flat revenue from the segment, so we are comfortable that the gross margin issues are largely one-off. Despite the industry volatility, we have seen solid underlying revenue and EPS growth over the past 12 years from ASMPT and we would expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future, albeit along with the industry's extreme volatility. ASMPT remains leveraged to the global semiconductor and electronics market and we expect both to grow in the long term. The company spent some time discussing recent demand driven by high performance computing and generative artificial intelligence, or AI, with the companys advanced packaging solutions expected to play an increasing role in both. We also see no signs of ASMPTs products losing their technological competitiveness so we would expect the company to fully participate in a market rebound when it comes. We retain our fair value estimate at HKD 90 with about a 22% downgrade in our 2023 net profit forecast offset by tweaks to outer year forecasts.","Well positioned to capitalize on the forecast medium- to long-term growth in the semiconductor market driven by Big Data, artificial intelligence, proliferation of electronics in autos and image sensors. Given ASMPT is the largest equipment company targeting its markets it can spend the R&D required to stay ahead of its competitors in this fast-moving segment.  In the short term the pressure on Chinese companies to localize their production during trade tensions could help ASMPT, as there are few local mainland competitors for its higher-end products.","There are few switching costs for most of ASMPTs equipment so its customers can switch suppliers if ASMPTs technology does not remain competitive. ASMPT has historically relied on selective acquisitions to help it grow its product portfolio and expand into new markets. A wrong turn on a large acquisition or two could be negative for the company. Chinas determination to be self-sufficient in technology could lead it to invest heavily in this space. This could pose long-term risks for ASMPT, depending on whether or not ASMPT is viewed as a true Chinese company.",25/10/2023,"ASMPT provides investors with exposure to long-term high-growth themes such as Big Data, 5G mobile networks and handsets, proliferation of semiconductors in autos and industrial Internet of Things as well as artificial intelligence, or AI, and high performance computing, or HPC, through the leading global equipment supplier in assembly and packaging and surface mounted technology. The high-tech nature of the equipment supply industry provides barriers to new entrants and allows most incumbents to earn above cost of capital returns over the long term, with ASMPT being no exception. We expect the company to continue to make strategic acquisitions in related areas where it can plug technology holes and add value through investment.  ASMPT has broad end-market exposure including 5G network infrastructure and terminals; image sensors in autonomous vehicles, smart homes and cities and for facial recognition; and displays for smartphones, wearables, virtual reality and automotive. Indeed, the biggest single application by market for the companys equipment is autos at 23%, industrials at 18% and consumer at around 13%. Around 30% of the companys revenue comes from China, with Europe generating a similar percentage. The geographical and end-market diversity help partially offset the inherent cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. On a semiconductor technology level there is also a school of thought that value is transferring from the front end (scaling process nodes) to the back end (advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration), which should support the likes of ASMPT. This is being driven by the cost of further front-end scaling with few companies being able to afford to develop the smaller nodes now that the original Moores Law seems to be broken. Generative AI is driving demand for HPC and ASMPT provides advanced semiconductor packaging equipment to help address this demand.","We assign ASMPT a narrow economic moat based on intangible assets and cost advantage. Key intangible assets include its brand and technical expertise through consistently high research and development spend over many years. ASMPT is larger than its key competitors in the back-end equipment and surface mounted technology businesses and we believe this provides it with the ability to outspend its competitors in absolute terms and stay ahead of the curve, adding a cost advantage moat source to its narrow moat. While the industry is very cyclical, the companys average return on invested capital over the past nine years of over 18% supports the narrow economic moat rating. ASMPT has spent an average of 7.5% of its revenue on research and development over the past 10 years. While this is lower than its key competitors in the assembly and packaging equipment market, Kulicke & Soffa Industries (12.2%) and BE Semiconductor Industries (9.9%), ASMPT is a larger business. ASMPTs overall R&D spend over this period in absolute terms is 70% greater than Kulicke & Soffa Industries and over 3.5 times the spend of BE Semiconductor Industries. The company has a patent portfolio of over 1,400 patents. Its competitors also have patents and evaluating their specific worth is beyond the scope of our capabilities. However, we believe the accumulated know-how from consistent R&D spend over many years gives all industry participants an advantage over potential new entrants--with ASMPT having an advantage over the other manufacturers given its size and market share. ASMPT has been the number one provider in the assembly and packaging equipment (or back-end) market since 2002, with a current market share of around 29% (company quoting VSLI Research). This market share has been gradually increasing among the top five manufacturers. This is ASMPTs largest segment, generating around 60% of its earnings and generating the highest average operating margin of around 19%. There are three main subsegments to this division: 1) integrated circuit packaging including older products such as die and wire bonders and newer advanced packaging products such as flip-chip bonders and laser dicers; 2) CMOS image sensors; and 3) optoelectronics (LED lighting). In the surface mounted technology equipment market ASMPT has had the number one position since 2016. Its market share of around 22% in 2022 grew from 11%-12% in 2011 when ASMPT purchased Siemens SMT business as the number three manufacturer in the market. ASMPT effectively took over the loss-making business from Siemens for free but did invest EUR 40 million into it to help it recover. It also purchased the DEK screen printer business from Dover Corporation in 2013. Since then, it has consistently gained market share and generated an operating profit of $175 million in 2021. Key competitors in this market include subsidiaries of Japanese conglomerates, Fuji and Panasonic. ASMPTs focus on the semiconductor manufacturing industry compared with its much larger, but less focused, rivals is credited with helping the market share gain. There may be some mild advantages from its reputation in the assembly and packaging business but there are few other obvious synergies from competing in both the SMT and assembly and packaging equipment markets. ASMPT also competes in the leadframe market where its joint venture, AAMI, is the number three player with about 9% market share. We do not assign a moat to this business, given its weaker market position and consistently lower margins. We do not believe ASMPT benefits from switching costs. The companys products physically last around five to eight years but will normally need to go through several upgrades in both hardware and software over this period to keep them up to date. More importantly, when semiconductor manufacturers need to replace the machines there are few switching costs to move to a different manufacturer. Brand and reputation for reliability will be part of the decision but if a new product is not at the right technology level and at the right price, customers can switch. On the latest cutting-edge technology, ASMPT will often work with a large semiconductor manufacturer to develop a machine, as it did with its latest automatic flip chip bonding system. This helps underwrite the R&D required and the companys brand, technical expertise and reputation help it win and execute on these opportunities. We cover five other companies that compete in the semiconductor equipment segment. Applied Materials, KLA Corp, Lam Research and ASML have wide moats, while ASM International has no moat. All four companies with moats have intangible assets moat sources around their equipment design, service contracts and customer collaboration during process development. All four also have cost advantage moats coming from scale advantages that fuel research and development spending at levels that only the large manufacturers can match. We believe ASMPT also benefits from scale-based cost advantage in the markets in which it competes. KLA Corp has products in every major chip-manufacturing facility in the world. This allows it to have a comprehensive database of defects encountered by customers and their respective solutions help chipmakers in troubleshooting endeavors. The more customers that take advantage of this access by anonymously submitting their own data to the collection, the greater the network effect that benefits all parties involved, adding network effect as a source of KLAs wide moat. We do not believe ASMPT benefits from such a network effect moat source. The one semiconductor equipment manufacturer under our coverage without a moat is ASMPTs parent company, ASM International. ASM International focuses on the front end of the semiconductor market. While is it the leader in a small segment of atomic layer deposition, we believe larger competitors such as Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and Applied Materials have begun to improve their offerings for the segment. Ultimately, competitors have considerably greater scale and resources than ASM International, in addition to more diversified product portfolios that would allow the former to endure cyclical downturns in a more profitable manner than the relatively specialized ASM International. Given that they are competing in different markets and have very different competitive positions, we believe the moat rating for ASM International has no bearing on the moat rating for ASMPT. Indeed, ASMPT indicated there were no significant synergies in having the front-end semiconductor machine manufacturer as an owner.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for ASMPT is High. While the company is well diversified, it continues to operate in a highly cyclical industry. In addition, with low switching costs for its equipment, ASMPTs products must remain competitive to win repeat orders. The companys historical track record and accumulated knowledge base should help in this regard, but the high technology space can sometimes be unpredictable and new technologies can spring up to replace technologies in which incumbents are strong. The company has made select acquisitions of companies with cutting-edge technology to help it stay at the technology forefront. Given only two semiconductor manufacturers currently have plans to go beyond 3nm nodes we could see some consolidation in this industry, which could increase volatility of returns in this space. While overall, we see the increasing expenses incurred in developing smaller nodes as a positive for ASMPTs advanced packaging business as value is transferred to back-end packaging, this could come at the expense of increased volatility in its business with the high-end silicon fabs.ASMPT has some moderate currency exposure through its SMT Solutions group. This group enters into U.S. dollars and euro hedging contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risks. This is as a significant portion of the production of SMT equipment and its suppliers are located in Europe, while a substantial part of the groups revenue for SMT equipment is denominated in U.S. dollars. ","We assess the capital allocation of ASMPT as Exemplary.Apart from a solid board structure and management team, the company has a very strong investment track record and has successfully built the companys position in the semiconductor machine industry. In one highlight, the company effectively took over the loss-making Siemens electronics assembly systems business, or SEAS business, for free in 2010 and has built it up to take over the mantle as the number one surface mount technology machine manufacturer since 2016. It makes regular bolt-on acquisitions, which seem to be adding to the companys technology portfolio, but are harder to evaluate from a financial perspective. For example it made three acquisitions in 2018: a EUR 52 million acquisition of AMICRA Microtechnologies, a supplier of ultra-high precision die-attach equipment specializing in submicron placement accuracy; a EUR 35 million acquisition of 78% of Critical Manufacturing; and a USD 100 million acquisition of TEL NEXX from Tokyo Electron, a supplier of electromechanical deposition and physical vapor deposition equipment for advanced packaging of semiconductor devices. Management also continues to invest in potentially disruptive technologies. In 2019, the group invested in a 3D laser printing company based in Israel whose technology may potentially disrupt the SMT printing industry. In 2018, the group invested in a Silicon Valley startup whose technology allows high speed x-ray inspection of advanced semiconductor packages. This could help make 100% real time inspection possible for advanced packaging. As well as acquisitions, the company has invested an average of 8.3% of its sales in research and development over the past 10 years to maintain and strengthen its intangible assets based moat. The long-term track record of building shareholder value is exemplified by the company listing with a market capitalization of HKD 75 million in 1989, which had grown to around HKD 29 billion by the end of September 2023, implying a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. The company also has a strong track record of shareholder returns, with an average dividend payout ratio of nearly 60% over the past 11 years and a total shareholder return (dividends plus buybacks) of around 80% of free cash flow over the same period.The company has maintained a strong balance sheet with net cash or small net debt balances over the past 10 years. We see this as prudent given the high revenue cyclicality of this business. From a shareholder returns perspective the company has paid a regular dividend with an average payout ratio of around 60% over the past 10 years. Given the cyclicality of earnings the absolute dividend has risen and fallen with the dividend payout ratio also varied, often inversely related to earnings to try to lower the impact of variable earnings on the dividend. The dividend payments and acquisitions have never compromised the balance sheet.","ASMPT designs, manufactures and sells precision equipment used to assemble semiconductors and other electronic equipment. Listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 1989, ASMPT is headquartered in Hong Kong and has operations in Asia, Europe and the U.S. It is the largest supplier globally in both the assembly and packaging equipment market and the surface mounted technology market.","At the end of December 2022, ASMPT had net cash, having ended eight of the past 11 years in a net cash position. Three company acquisitions in 2018 and an industry downturn in the first half of 2019 saw the company dip into net debt territory in 2019, but a solid 2020 and the sale of 56% of its materials business into a joint venture in 2020 saw a return to net cash. A strong balance sheet is useful in such a cyclical industry and the company will always be looking out for suitable acquisitions to keep its technology at the forefront. We assume an ongoing dividend payout ratio of 50% in line with company guidance. We note that the company has paid out around 80% of its free cash flow as either dividends or buybacks over the past 11 years. At the first-half 2022 result the company announced a buyback of up to HKD 420 million, due partially to the low prevailing share price relative to historical levels.

24/11/2023,CureVac Continues to Make Pipeline Progress on mRNA Candidates; $15.40 FVE,CureVac NV,CVAC,4,20/11/2023,Rachel Elfman,5.45,USD,23/11/2023,15.4,Very High,,Standard,C,20/11/2023,"CureVac reported its third-quarter results, and the company is continuing to make progress across its early-stage mRNA pipeline. CureVac reported quarterly revenue of EUR 16.5 million, which is up from EUR 11.2 million in the prior-year period. We maintain CureVac's fair value estimate of $15.40 per share, no moat rating, and Extreme uncertainty rating. We view the stock as undervalued for long-term investors with a very high degree of risk tolerance. Shares are trading at a 64% discount to our fair value estimate on a risk-adjusted basis. During the quarter, CureVac completed enrollment for its phase 2 COVID-19 study with mono and bivalent vaccine candidates, and we await a data readout in early 2024. CureVac's seasonal flu phase 2 study also made progress with the first participant dosed, and this triggered a milestone payment by wide-moat GSK of EUR 15 million. We assign both candidates a 35% probability of approval in our base case and anticipate they could reach the market as early as 2025. CureVac reported cash and cash equivalents of EUR 464 million at quarter-end, which is down from EUR 495 million at the end of 2022. The decrease was driven by ongoing research and development activities and capital expenditures. As an early-stage biotech company, CureVac continues to heavily invest in its pipeline candidates, but we think the company is in a stable financial position at least for the next couple of years thanks to its ability to raise capital by issuing shares and receiving milestone payments as its pipeline progresses. We see significant uncertainty related to regulatory approvals for CureVac's largely early stage pipeline and lack of approved products, so the company warrants a no moat and Extreme uncertainty rating. We continue to believe there is uncertainty around CureVac's defenses against other novel mRNA vaccine makers due to Moderna and BioNTech's first-mover status in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine market.","Partnerships allow CureVac to receive milestones and economic benefits from drug candidate progression while offsetting some of the clinical development costs.  If CureVac's mRNA technology proves successful, it could compete in a wide range of therapeutic areas ranging from other prophylactic vaccines (like influenza and malaria) to oncology and protein therapies. While CureVac's 2nd-gen COVID-19 vaccine is in early development stages, we assign a higher than typical probability weighting due to the favorable safety profile in the 1st-gen vaccine and its broad technology approach.","If approved, CureVac's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will face competition from first-movers BioNTech and Moderna. COVID-19 vaccine sales have been massive for other companies with approved vaccines during the pandemic, but the evolution of a potentially less threatening variant and transition to an endemic could hinder CureVac's COVID-19 vaccine sales. The extreme level of uncertainty related to CureVacs potential outcomes highlights the risks associated with its early-stage pipeline. ",28/03/2023,"CureVac was founded in 2000, and its focus is on developing vaccines and therapies using messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA. mRNA offers several advantages, including cell-free, rapid, large-scale manufacturing and the ability to substitute new genetic sequences to create novel vaccines. Vaccines are typically composed of weakened viruses or proteins (antigens) that they express. In mRNA vaccines, the genetic code for an antigen is administered to patients who then manufacture the antigen themselves, which triggers an immune response. CureVac's portfolio includes clinical and preclinical candidates across multiple diseases in prophylactic vaccines, oncology, and molecular therapies. CureVacs first attempt to develop a COVID-19 vaccine did not have sufficient efficacy data and was discontinued in October 2021. The company is collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline to develop a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine using a broad technology approach with unmodified and modified mRNA constructs. CureVac and Glaxo are evaluating both types of mRNA to determine which will have stronger efficacy against COVID-19. Further, it is evaluating advanced vaccine formats to create combination vaccines with an initial focus on combining COVID-19 and influenza. Management expects there will be a suitable second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate by the end of 2022 to then start late-stage trials.  The companys other early-stage pipeline candidates include mRNA prophylactic vaccines for several diseases, such as influenza, rabies, and malaria. CureVac also has enhanced its oncology vaccine capabilities through the 2022 acquisition of Frame Cancer Therapeutics, which is focused on identifying neoantigens across different cancer types. In addition, CureVac established a partnership with Belgium-based myNEO to develop mRNA-based cancer vaccines using myNEOs tumor antigen discovery platform. CureVac has collaborations with several organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CRISPR Therapeutics to develop some of its pipeline candidates. While CureVac does not currently have approved products, it provides long-term investors with pure-play exposure to mRNA.","We assign CureVac a no-moat rating. We think the company has the funding and technological capabilities to potentially bring several of its pipeline mRNA programs to market. However, we see significant uncertainty related to regulatory approvals for CureVacs early-stage portfolio and a range of potential outcomes. We also see substantial uncertainty around CureVacs defenses against other novel mRNA vaccine makers due to Moderna and BioNTechs first-mover status in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine market. The narrow moat definition states that excess normalized returns must more likely than not be positive 10 years from now. There also must not be any substantial threat of major value destruction for a narrow moat company. CureVacs extreme Uncertainty Rating highlights the substantial threat of major value destruction for the company, so a no-moat rating is appropriate. CureVac was founded in 2000, and its focus is on developing vaccines and therapies using messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA. Researchers discovered mRNA in the early 1960s, and since then it has been studied as the basis for novel vaccines. mRNA offers several advantages, including cell-free, rapid, large-scale manufacturing and the ability to substitute new genetic sequences to create novel vaccines. Vaccines are typically composed of weakened viruses or proteins (antigens) that they express. In mRNA vaccines, the genetic code for an antigen is administered to patients who then manufacture the antigen themselves, which triggers an immune response. In addition, mRNA therapy doesn't affect DNA or result in permanent genetic changes, so it affords more flexibility with dose changes and local tissue production compared with gene therapies.There are many challenges with mRNA that companies must overcome to achieve regulatory approval. mRNA is very fragile, and it needs to be stored at cold temperatures to prevent deterioration. Once administered, mRNA is quickly recognized as foreign genetic material, and its targeted by our immune system for destruction. This immune response can also lead to side effects that can limit dosing. CureVac began development of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in January 2020. The vaccine candidate selected for clinical development, Caving, was a non-chemically modified mRNA encoding the spike protein of the SIRS-Cv-2 virus and formulated within Lipid Nonpareils (Lineups). CureVac established a vaccine manufacturing partnership with Buyer to produce its COVID-19 vaccine so it could be readily available for mass distribution if successful in clinical trials. However, CureVac reported late-stage phase ba/3 results in June 2021 with overall vaccine efficacy of 48% against COVID-19 of any severity. Participants in the age group of 18 to 60 had an efficacy of 53% while participants above 60 years did not have a statistically significant determination of efficacy. The efficacy results were quite disappointing, especially compared with Moderna and BioNTechs very strong efficacies of 94.1% and 95%, respectively. CureVac decided to discontinue its first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate in October 2021 and focus its efforts on its second-generation COVID-19 vaccine, which it partnered with GlaxoSmithKline to develop. CureVacs results from its first-generation COVID-19 study found a favorable safety profile of CVnCoV in all age groups. The key issue was low efficacy, especially among participants above 60 years. Management attributes the lower efficacy results to the 15 different COVID-19 variants that were part of its clinical trial data readout. However, we are skeptical that the low efficacy results from CureVacs first-generation trial can be largely attributed to the variants since Moderna and BioNTechs approved vaccines still have high efficacy against multiple variants. Despite the disappointing results, the favorable safety profile should help expedite CureVac and Glaxos development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Unlike Moderna and BioNTechs COVID-19 vaccines, CureVacs first-generation candidate had the advantage of being stored at standard refrigerator temperatures. Moderna and BioNTechs first-generation COVID-19 vaccines require very cold freezers, which makes it more difficult to transport and store. Additionally, CureVacs first-generation vaccine required a lower dose, which would have allowed for more expedited and less costly mass production. We will closely watch the development of CureVac and Glaxos second-generation COVID-19 vaccine to see if it will also allow for storage at standard refrigerator temperatures and have low doses. CureVacs second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, is taking a broader approach using both unmodified mRNA and modified mRNA constructs. We think CureVac will have a higher likelihood of approval for the second-generation COVID-19 vaccine thanks to its partnership and support from Glaxo, combined with its knowledge and experience from the first-generation COVID-19 trial. CureVac and Glaxos unmodified and modified mRNA constructs are intended to target variants. Further, it is evaluating advanced vaccine formats to create combination vaccines with an initial focus on combining COVID-19 and influenza. CureVac is also trying to create immune responses at lower doses, which should help enable the development of multivalent and combination vaccines.Even though CureVac and Glaxos COVID-19 vaccine is in the early stages of development, we assign a probability of approval of 35%. This probability is higher than our typical weighting for early-stage pipeline candidates at other companies due to the favorable safety profile established in CureVacs first-generation COVID-19 vaccine. The higher-than-typical probability weighting is also attributed to its broad technology approach using unmodified and modified mRNA constructs. The companies are evaluating both types of mRNA to determine which will have stronger efficacy data against COVID-19. Management expects there will likely be a suitable candidate by the end of 2022 to then start late-stage trials. CureVacs ability to successfully launch differentiated mRNA therapies in addition to COVID-19, ranging from prophylactic vaccines (including rabies, rotavirus, and malaria) to oncology treatments, and therapies for ocular and lung diseases will be key to the firm's ability to potentially establish a moat in the future. Multiple competitors are making advancements in mRNA technologies, which could interfere with CureVacs potential to see the kind of monopoly pricing power enjoyed by other innovative vaccines, such as GlaxoSmithKline's Shingrix and Pfizer's Prevnar, which were launched in recent years. We would reconsider our no-moat assessment if CureVac receives approval for several of its pipeline candidates and gains market share to establish itself as a leader in the mRNA field.We are closely watching the development of CureVacs second-generation COVID-19 vaccine and how its pipeline will progress beyond COVID-19 for signs of competitive advantages. The surge of investments in vaccine development during the pandemic and the existence of several mRNA vaccine players that have competing technologies, including Moderna and BioNTechs already-approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, have made this space more competitive. The competition in mRNA, CureVacs early-stage pipeline, and the wide range of outcomes depending on the results of CureVacs clinical trials lead us to an extreme level of uncertainty. The substantial threats of major value destruction make a no-moat rating appropriate. ","We assign CureVac a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Extreme. We see significant uncertainty related to regulatory approvals for CureVacs early-stage pipeline candidates and a range of potential outcomes. We also see substantial uncertainty around CureVacs defenses against other novel mRNA vaccine makers due to Moderna and BioNTechs first-mover status in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine market. Product governance is a key environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk for CureVac, as failure to adhere to extensive regulations can lead to expensive recalls, increased regulatory scrutiny, and lawsuits from affected customers. Access to basic services is another ESG risk CureVac will face if its drugs receive approval, as its sales will depend on reimbursements from third-party payers, such as Medicaid or Medicare, private insurers, and national healthcare systems. Attempts by governments to contain healthcare costs could result in pricing pressure and lead to reduced profit margins. ","We assign CureVac a Standard capital allocation rating. Our analysis evaluates what we determine to be the three key facets of management decision-making from the perspective of shareholders: balance sheet strength, investment efficacy, and distributions. Our Standard rating results from a sound balance sheet, fair investment strategy, and an assessment of shareholder distributions as appropriate. CureVac's revenue cyclicality possesses a medium rating and its operating leverage has a low rating. We believe CureVac has a sound balance sheet due to management's demonstrated ability to maintain low levels of debt and run a fairly lean operation despite burning cash as it works to advance its pipeline candidates. As of year-end 2021, CureVac held over EUR 800 million in cash and equivalents.We view CureVac's investment decisions as fair. As an early-stage biotechnology company, it invests heavily in R&D as it focuses on developing its pipeline. The validation of CureVac's mRNA technology will be crucial and likely help the company receive approvals for other products in the future.Finally, we assess overall shareholder distributions as appropriate. The company does not currently pay a dividend, and we view this as appropriate since CureVac is investing in its pipeline to help build its value for long-term shareholders.CureVac is led by Franz-Werner Haas, who joined the company in June 2012. In August 2020, he was appointed CEO. Prior to his function as CEO, he was acting CEO as well as COO.

24/11/2023,Imperial Brands Reports In Line Fiscal 2023 Performance,Imperial Brands PLC,IMBBY,5,15/11/2023,Philip Gorham,23.75,USD,23/11/2023,36.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,15/11/2023,"There were few surprises in Imperial Brands' full-year fiscal 2023 results, as the company released a trading update in October that indicated that full-year performance would be in line with management's guidance and our forecasts. We are reiterating our GBX 2,900 fair value estimate and wide moat rating, while raising our ADR valuation to $36 from $34 to account for the stronger U.S. dollar, and we continue to believe the current market valuation provides an investment opportunity for long-term value investors. Full-year revenue of GBP 9.5 billion, representing organic growth of 0.7% and 1.4% excluding the disposed Russian assets, was a whisker ahead of our forecast thanks to very strong price/mix of 10%. Imperial's footprint includes some positions in rapidly declining markets, and its volume decline of 7% (excluding Russia) is above that of large cap wide-moat peers Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco. Revenue from next generation products, or NGP, grew by 27%, but at only 3% of consolidated sales, Imperial's NGP portfolio is smaller than those of its rivals, and we do not expect recent market launches to move the needle on growth yet. As expected, Imperial reported strong operating profit growth of 27% and achieved an EBIT margin of 35.9%, implying 540 basis points of expansion. We expect Imperial to maintain these margins next year, although operating deleverage is likely to force profitability down in the long term, and we forecast a 32% steady state margin. Imperial's full-year cash conversion rate was 92%, and the company is being managed to maximize cash flow. Our investment case is that while Imperial will not compound returns on capital as quickly as some of its competitors, total return should be fairly attractive due to the capacity for the generous return of capital to shareholders and because the equity is being priced at a level that undervalues the cash flows of the business. These results support that thesis.","The appointment of Simon Langelier, chairman of cannabis oil extract manufacturer PharamCielo, to the board of directors could open the door for Imperial to exploit more liberal legislation in the U.S. Imperial generates some of the highest margins in the industry on its cigarette portfolio. If plain packaging legislation spreads, Imperial, through its value portfolio, may be the manufacturer best positioned to benefit.","With Philip Morris and British American Tobacco focused on diversifying revenue away from cigarettes, the probability of Imperial being acquired at a valuation premium has almost evaporated, in our view. Brand loyalty to Imperial's value brands is weaker than that to British American and particularly to Philip Morris International, which owns Marlboro, the only truly global cigarette brand. We estimate price elasticity stays roughly unchanged in the event of steady excise tax hikes, but one-time large tax increases can disrupt volume and elasticity temporarily.",15/11/2023,"Stefan Bomhard unveiled a five-year strategic plan in 2021 that will concentrate Imperial's investments geographically and on emerging categories that are likely to become the largest profit pools in the future. The plan essentially recognizes Imperial's place in the marketplaceit is a fast follower, rather than a leader, in most markets. This makes Imperial a different investment proposition than its Big Tobacco peers, particularly Philip Morris International, which is investing in growth and moving away from the secular decline of the cigarette industry. Imperial, on the other hand, is likely to be the company more exposed to cigarettes, and although it should trade at a discount to its peer group, Imperial should remain a highly profitable and cash-generative business. Under the new strategy, investment is focused on categories and geographies where Imperial has existing strengths, and where consumer demand is likely to be strong. In the core cigarette business, for example, Imperial prioritizes five tobacco markets (U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, and Australia) in which it holds significant share and which in aggregate represent more than 70% of Imperial's tobacco operating profit. Other markets, as well as the firm's smaller brands, are being managed to maximize cash flow. In next-generation products, Imperial has exited vaping markets in which it has not gained traction, in order to target its investments on more profitable opportunities. In heated tobacco, it is shifting its geographic focus from Japan, where it has very limited share and distribution structure, to Europe, where it has pockets of large shares. The evidence so far is very promising. In fiscal 2022 and 2023, Imperial won aggregate share in its target markets, in a reversal of recent trends, grew organic revenue modestly as price/mix more than offset volume declines, and it did so without a major margin reset. A critical tenant of the investment thesis is returns to shareholders, and the company recently initiated a GBP 1 billion 12-month buyback program, which we think is repeatable in most environments, and has headroom to grow the dividend steadily.","Imperial Brands wide economic moat is built around intangible assets in the tobacco business. Tight government regulations have made barriers to entry almost insurmountable and have kept market shares stable in the core combustible business. Consumers are fairly brand-loyal, particularly in premium price segments, creating another intangible asset that is no longer as prevalent in other consumer categories. Finally, economies of scale give the large-cap manufacturers an advantage in tobacco leaf procurement and distribution. Nevertheless, we regard the firm as being slightly lower-quality than its larger competitors Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco, owing to its portfolio skew to developed markets, where volume declines are more pronounced, and to discount categories. We estimate that following Imperials U.S. acquisitions, 20% of volume is in premium segments, roughly in line with Japan Tobacco, but more than half is in discount segments. Intangible AssetsTobacco contains nicotine, an addictive substance that suppresses the cessation rate. According to data from the Tobacco Atlas, more than 60% of all smokers intended to quit, and 42% had attempted to quit in 2019. Yet in most markets, the smoking rate is in only a very modest decline, implying that a majority of smokers attempting to quit fail to do so. Academic research (Lewis et al, 2015) has shown that while cessation rates are not correlated with consumer brand loyalty, premium price segments are associated at a statistically significant level with lower cessation rates. Imperial manages a barbell portfolio, with exposure both to discount and superpremium segments (the latter through brands such as Davidoff and Gauloises).The addictive nature of the product forms a powerful competitive advantage when combined with very tight government regulation that over the years has served to dampen market share volatility and competition on price. Tobacco advertising is severely restricted in most markets, with bans on most forms of mass marketing. This not only makes it very difficult for hypothetical new entrants to gain the attention of smokers, but it also dampens competition between incumbent manufacturers. Volume shares at the manufacturer level have been very stable for decades, primarily, we believe, because the lack of marketing communication has discouraged brand switching. Marketing spend intensity varies across consumer product categories, but manufacturers in more competitive categories roughly spend on average a high-single-digit percentage of sales on marketing. Big tobacco manufacturers have historically spent around 1.5% of sales on advertising (although we expect next-generation products to require greater spending), with the difference accruing to the EBIT margin. Some other regulations may also have had the unintended consequence of limiting competition on price and creating a barrier to entry. Point-of-sale display bans limit manufacturers ability to communicate pricing, thus creating a disincentive to engage in price promotional strategies, which have historically contracted the industry profit pool. Perhaps the most clear-cut example of regulation creating insurmountable barriers to entry has been the impact of the FDA in the U.S., where Imperial is the fifth-largest manufacturer (including China National Tobacco Company) in factory-made cigarettes with a 3.4% share of the global market in 2022, according to Euromonitor. The marketing of new tobacco products is subject to FDA approval, which is only granted following consideration of a request to market a new product or for requests made before March 2011, under the substantial equivalence test, which limits marketing approval only to products that are proven to possess similar characteristics and risk profiles to predicate products.Despite consumer segmentation in other consumer product categories amid eroding brand loyalty, brand equity remains relevant in tobacco. This is in no small part due to the absence of challenger brands because of high regulatory barriers to entry, and because of the tight restrictions on marketing. Brand loyalty tends to be higher in premium price segments, and more than half of Imperials portfolio is in the commoditized discount segments, where brand loyalty is lowest and consumers are price-sensitive.Cost AdvantageUnlike its larger competitors Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco, and British American Tobacco, we do not believe Imperial Brands has a cost advantage. Cigarette manufacturing is a scalable business model because of the homogeneity of the product, and there is an inverse correlation between volume and average operating cost per unit. As Imperial is smaller, its average cost is higher than that of PMI. In 2022, we estimate that PMIs operating cost per pack of cigarettes (excluding the RRP business) was $0.46 on total tobacco volume of 731 billion sticks. At a cable rate of 1.25, we estimate comparable costs per pack were $0.84 for Imperial Brands (in the 12 months to Sept. 30, 2023), on under one third the volume of PMI. Imperial's average cost is also above that of Japan Tobacco (at $0.42 per pack) despite JT's portfolio being concentrated in the midpriced segment.Wide Versus NarrowThough it may seem counterintuitive in a declining industry, we have conviction that our wide moat rating is appropriate because we believe Imperial is very likely to continue generating excess returns on invested capital for the next 20 years. The durability of current levels of profitability and returns on capital depend on the positive impact of price/mix being at least in line with the annual volume decline. At some point in the future, we expect there to be a tipping point at which the consumer is no longer willing to continue accepting price increases above the broader rate of inflation, leading to an increase in price elasticity. The example of Australia gives some insight into how such a kink in the demand curve might occur globally. Since 2011, a series of draconian anticigarette measures in Australia have led to the introduction of plain packs and tax increases that caused the doubling of the retail price of cigarettes in just six years, which in turn led to the smoking rate falling from 16% to 13% over the same period, and to significant trading down between price segments. A pack of 20 cigarettes (equivalent; a standard pack contains 25 sticks in Australia) now costs approximately $26, according to a survey by Tobacco in Australia, well above the roughly $17 average retail price in the U.K., $8.41 in the U.S., and roughly $5.50 on average globally, according to the World Health Organization. Assuming the Australia experience is applicable to price elasticity in other markets, it appears likely that there remains a great deal of headroom for price increases globally. At 4% real pricing (based on 6% nominal price/mix and 2% global inflation), this crude calculation suggests that it will be 2046 before global pricing reaches levels at which price elasticity increased in Australia. This is comfortably longer than 20 years, the benchmark period that we expect wide-moat companies to continue generating economic rent.The spread of Imperials return on invested capital over its weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, is narrower than that of PMI because of the less efficient logistics assets. Imperial does not break down its balance sheet between its tobacco and logistics operations, but based on the run rates of depreciation and amortization, and assuming similar useful lives across segments, we estimate that the ROICs of the tobacco business are 10 percentage points higher than the consolidated ROIC, which implies the tobacco business generates ROIC including goodwill of close to 30%.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Imperial Brands is Medium. The performance of the industry during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that tobacco remains a highly defensive industry. However, fat-tail risk remains, and we think Imperial has more inherent risk than some of its competitors due to its portfolio skew to low-end price points and fast-follower status in NGPs.Although tobacco businesses are generally stable, government intervention is an omnipresent threat. Imperial's U.S. presence gives it exposure to FDA risk, including recent moves by the federal government to ban menthol in cigarettes in the U.S. Imperial generated 19% of its revenue and 28% of its EBIT in the U.S. in 2021, and owns the second largest menthol brand, Kool.In general, we believe regulation does little to affect the economic moat or the cash flows of tobacco manufacturers, and in some cases, regulation actually limits competition, lowers cost, and strengthens pricing power. However, the New Zealand and U.K. governments have recently announced plans to phase out smoking over a generation, which, if implemented more broadly, would have a significant impact on the timeframe in which Imperial can sell cigarettes.The emergence of cigarette alternatives does present the tobacco manufacturers with heightened risk. We believe the greatest risk is that the industry evolves into a fragmented series of sub-categories, limiting the previous benefits of scale and making it difficult to replicate margins of the lucrative cigarette business.The social impact of tobacco products is rated as a severe risk by Morningstar Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Rating of Imperial. We assume a mid-single-digit volume decline rate in the cigarette industry, but we flex this assumption in our scenario analysis to reflect the risk that the decline rate could accelerate. Although the externalities of smoking have largely been internalized, the risk remains of increased taxation and/or operating costs.","Our Morningstar capital allocation rating for Imperial Brands is Standard. However, this is a forward-looking rating and we acknowledge there have been some significant capital alloctation missteps in Imperial's recent history.As alternatives to cigarettes gained traction over the last few years, the multinational manufacturers have mitigated risk by diversifying their product portfolios. Imperial Brands adopted a very limited strategy, making a large bet on vaping by acquiring Blu during the break-up of Lorillard in 2014, while staying on the sidelines of heated tobacco. We always regarded that as a mistake because we expected heated tobacco to be the most likely new generation category to win consumer adoption. Nevertheless, Imperial's error was not the acquisition of Blu; its error was its attempt to scale this commoditized category globally while ignoring the merits of heated tobacco. The $7.1 billion, or 7 times EBITDA, paid for the Lorillard assets afforded some optionality on Blu. Subsequent investments behind Blu have been significant, however, while Imperial remained a spectator as heated tobacco grew to 20% of the tobacco market in Japan, with Philip Morris International the primary beneficiary. Meanwhile, the vaping category contracted materially in 2020, particularly in the U.S. following a regulatory clampdown on nicotine liquid flavors, and Imperial's net revenue from next generation products (primarily vaping) halved in fiscal 2020.Having invested in emerging categories that were not delivering financial returns, and having lost ground to first movers in heated tobacco, Imperial has adjusted its strategy to that of a fast follower, implying lower levels of investment, and has withdrawn from NGP categories in several noncore markets. It manages its cigarette business for cash. The early signs of this strategy are positive. Since fiscal 2022, Imperial's growth algorithm has normalized to what we expect will be similar to its medium-term profile, with price/mix more than offsetting the cigarette volume decline, and operating profit grew modestly.Capital allocation has also improved. Having rebased the dividend in 2020, we see headroom to now grow the dividend faster than earnings for a few years. In addition, the firm commenced a GBP 1 billion 12-month share repurchase programme, and if the current financial performance can be maintained, we think Imperial can comfortably keep the buyback program going beyond this year as well as raise the dividend at a mid-single-digit clip.Imperial's historical acquisitions have brought mixed results. The 2007 acquisition of Altadis appeared rich, at 14 times EBITDA, a valuation at the high end of historical tobacco transactions. Although the logistics business Logista, that came to Imperial with Altadis, was retained following the recent strategic review, we would not be surprised if it is jettisoned eventually, as it is a drag on ROIC. Reemtsma, bought in 2002 for 12.7 times EBITDA, was also acquired at an above-historical valuation for the industry, but Tobaccor at 1.5 times sales was a value-enhancing deal.","Imperial Brands is the world's fourth-largest international tobacco company (excluding China National Tobacco) with total fiscal 2023 volume of 198 billion cigarettes sold in more than 160 countries. The firm holds a leading global position in the fine-cut tobacco and hand-rolling paper categories, and it has a logistics platform in Western Europe, Altadis. Through acquisition, Imperial is the third-largest manufacturer in the U.S. and owns the Winston and blu brands.","With net debt/adjusted EBITDA at 2 times at the end of fiscal 2023, Imperial's balance sheet is stronger than tobacco competitors British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International, and roughly in line with most of its peers in the broader consumer defensive sector. The company has deleveraged from its 2015 acquisitions of U.S. assets from Reynolds American and Lorillard, and now intends to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.Imperial's presence in developed markets makes it a cash-generating machine, even more so since the U.S. acquisitions. The firm has been operating in recent years on a strongly negative cash conversion cycle, and cash conversion has been up there with the best-in-class performers across the global consumer staples space. We expect cash conversion (defined as operating cash flow divided by operating income) to run close to 100% over our five-year explicit forecast period. Management abandoned its medium-term guidance of 10% dividend growth in 2019, then went one step further in fiscal 2020 by cutting the second-half dividend by one third. With the adjusted payout ratio now at a comfortable 70% of net income, we think there is potential for the dividend to grow faster than earnings at a mid-single-digit rate. Imperial generates almost GBP 3 billion in free cash flow, and the dividend at its current level represents GBP 1.3 billion of that, which leaves plenty of room for share repurchases.

24/11/2023,Streaming Revenue Should Experience a Boost From Subscription Price Increases,Warner Music Group Corp,WMG,3,17/11/2023,Ali Mogharabi,33.4,USD,23/11/2023,36.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,17/11/2023,"While Warner Musics fiscal fourth-quarter results came in shy of our estimates, they beat consensus on the top and bottom lines as the improving demand for streaming music accelerated year-over-year growth. In the future, we think the firm will continue to benefit from the digital service providers higher prices. We also think that an adjusted revenue share model that Warner Music and some of its peers including Universal Music have launched with digital service provider Deezer and the continuing increase in demand for their content from consumers will drive growth. Regarding the bottom line, we expect further margin expansion driven by revenue growth, additional content monetization options, and benefits from restructuring. While we slightly reduced our revenue growth assumption for the next five years, we remain confident about the firms higher margin during that period. We are maintaining our $36 fair value estimate, and in our view, the stock remains fairly valued. Total revenue increased 6% year over year to $1.6 billion, with growth in both recorded music (4%) and music publishing (17%). Overall streaming revenue increased nearly 13%, driven by recorded music (up nearly 10%) and publishing (up 28%), both of which included benefits from copyright case settlements last year. The growth in the recorded music segments streaming revenue was mainly due to higher advertising revenue and the renewal of an agreement with TikTok early in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes more merchandise and events monetization opportunities for Warner Music. Last years Copyright Royalty Board decision regarding royalty rates by digital service providers helped increase the publishing streaming revenue.","Music streaming services like Spotify still have a long runway for subscriber growth, bringing more revenue into the music ecosystem for labels and artists alike. Warner will continue to gain share in the recorded music segment because of its focus on hip-hop and other youth-orientated genres. Warner will be able to gain leverage on its A&R investments as streaming of its catalog increases. ",Warner is overly dependent on streaming services that are diversifying their revenue streams into areas like podcasts. The streaming platforms will demand lower royalty rates in the future as their power grows.  Superstar artists can go directly to consumers and cut out the label on both recorded and publishing sides. Increased A&R competition between the labels will squeeze margins as labels pay more for new artists that are still likely to fail.,17/11/2023,"Warner Music Group is the third largest of the three major global record labels, with Vivendis Universal Music in first and Sony Music in second. Like its peers, Warner increasingly depends on streaming. Streaming services delivered 65% of total recording segment revenue in fiscal 2023, up from 30% in fiscal 2016. This percentage actually understates the overall impact of streaming, as Warner Music does not break out the streaming portion of publishing revenue separately. We project that overall streaming revenue for the recorded music industry will grow 9% annually from 2024 until 2028, driven by a number of factors, including our forecast that the number of paid streaming music subscribers will double to over 800 million. The increase will be powered by the continued adoption of mobile data plans, smartphones, and slightly increased penetration against the growing base of LTE/5G subscribers. Other drivers include price increases for streaming services, growing ad revenue as advertisers continue to shift their ad spending toward digital, and revenue growth at ad-supported services in emerging markets based on both the number of impressions but also pricing per impression as listener density increases. While Warner will benefit from the growth of streaming, we think that revenue from both digital downloads and physical media will continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace for physical. We think the growing adoption of streaming will continue to hit digital downloads harder than physical sales, where a core, though shrinking, base of loyal listeners remains. We believe that streaming will continue to replace the purchase of digital singles for most consumers, as the newest songs can be listened to on the major streaming services at the same time or even before theyre available for download. Despite strong projected growth in overall recorded music, we expect that A&R, or artists and repertoire, will only decline slightly as a percentage of revenue. A&R cost will to continue to grow in absolute terms as Warner will continue to invest in finding and developing new artists even as it sees more competition from its larger peers. ","We assign Warner Music a narrow moat rating derived from intangible assets. The firm is the third largest and only pure play of the three major global record labels. Modern music generally contains two copyrights: The first covers the sound recording itself (known as the master), and the second covers the underlying composition, which includes the lyrics and the musical composition. At Warner, the recorded music segment deals with the sound recording, and the publishing arm monetizes the composition and lyrics copyrights. The music industry has been massively affected by the increasingly ubiquitous reach of the internet over the past 25 years. Recorded music was one of the first industries to be hit by the growth in internet penetration and the almost concurrent rise of digital piracy. As a result, the industry shrank from revenue of $23.4 billion in 2001 to $14.8 billion in 2010, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, as the slow growth in digital download sales was nowhere close to enough to offset the rapid drop in physical media sales. The industry continued to decline over the next four years, bottoming at $14 billion of revenue in 2014.Thanks to consumers of all ages adopting streaming via both general media sites like YouTube and music-specific platforms like Spotify, the music recording industry has enjoyed five years of growth since 2014, with global revenue crossing the $26.2 billion mark in 2022, a level last seen in 2004, according to the IFPI. While the internet has also democratized the ability to directly record, distribute, and market music for artists, most of the money in the recorded music ecosystem still flows through record labels. The growth of streaming platforms like Spotify benefits the major labels like Warner Music for both its recorded music and publishing segments. In the U.S., Spotify and its peers pay royalties for both the recording (master) and the composition (digital performance when not selected and mechanical when user selected) unlike terrestrial radio, which only pays a performance royalty to the composition copyright-holder. This means the recording artist, songwriter, composer, and of course, the holders of the master (record label) and composition (publisher) all share in the royalty revenue from one song. While the actual royalty calculations for streaming revenue are complicated, the major labels generally have global payout rates with the largest music-specific platforms of 60% of 70% of revenue. The split is done on a market share basis between labels and then by individual songs to determine the royalty split at the master/composition level. Given this variable nature of streaming-related revenue, major labels like Warner are well positioned to benefit from increased streaming penetration and revenue from increased ad and subscription pricing. The deals between the labels and streaming platforms are relatively short at three years on average and the last signed deals between Warner and most platforms didnt see significant changes to royalty rates. The growth of nonmusic listening, like podcasts, could decrease the importance of music and thus payout ratio, but we believe that most users will listen to both podcast and music, much like time has always been split between music, news, and talk radio historically. Additionally, if Spotify could increase stickiness via podcasts, the firm would also likely be able to increase subscription costs, which offset some or most of the market share/mindshare losses on Spotify.On the recorded music side, labels discover, develop, and market artists and their music, which generally includes marketing, distributing, licensing, and selling the recordings created by the signed artists. Many recording artists fail to gain traction in a competitive marketplace with or without the help of a major label. This high level of failure and the required upfront investment by labels means that artists generally get a low percentage of royalties, 10%-15%, with more-established artists garnering high rates in their later contracts. Record contracts with artists can take on many different forms, but the two of the most common are the standard record deal and the 360 deal. The standard record deal was most common before the rise of digital music and was structured based on a number of albums, generally five, with only the first one guaranteed for new artists. The label provides advances on royalties and a production and promotion budget. With the rise of digital downloads and streaming, 360 deals are now signed more often. In a 360 deal, the label can receive a percentage of multiple revenue sources, including digital, physical media, artist rights like touring, sponsorships, ticketing, and merchandising, and licensing of music. The majors view these new sources like artist rights and licensing as growth drivers to offset the ongoing decline in physical media. At Warner, for example, artist rights increased by nearly 150% to $744 million in fiscal 2023 from $301 million in fiscal 2015, while physical media dropped to $507 million from $767 million over the same period.The three majors are better capitalized than independent labels and thus can invest more resources into the scouting and development of A&R. Part of this advantage is the financial ability to take more risks on new talent. But other resources, like development teams and coaches, production facilities, other talent with cross-promotion potential, and marketing teams are stronger at the labels than elsewhere. Amplification of an artist and her works is an important piece of standing out in the massive flood of content that is put on the market daily. In the current always-on world, the ability to have a large number people and resources devoted to a wide range of artists helps the major labels attract new talent. The majors also benefit from a diversified portfolio of artists versus minor labels, which not only have much smaller rosters but also tend to focus on a genre or subgenre of music. In contrast, the three majors have talent from across the world and can relatively easily pivot into a new genre when it becomes popular or even beforehand.While independent labels have beaten the majors to finding and developing high-profile artists over the last 30 years, many of the most famous labels have either closed shop or been subsumed by the majors, like Sub Pop (Nirvana) by Warner or Def Jam (Run-DMC) by Universal. Additionally, the long track record of the majors in helping to develop and maintain massive superstars is highly appealing to many artists at the beginning of their careers. This intangible asset also helps the majors sign artists away from healthy independent labels even if the artist is on the cusp of stardom or already there. The internet, along with cheap and widely available digital tools, has made it much easier for artists to directly record/produce, distribute, and market music to consumers. However, this benefit has produced a deluge of songs, making it more difficult for any single artist to stand out. While minor labels could help these artists, the majors provide amplification along with larger budgets, access to other talent, and development tools. Even some of the independent artists who made it out of the morass via a massive viral hit have signed with major labels, including Lil Nas X of Old Country Road fame, who signed with Columbia Records (Sony), and Danny Ocean, the singer-songwriter behind Me Rehuso, who joined Atlantic Record (Warner).The publishing arm focuses on the underlying compositions instead of the artists. For example, Warner Chappell, one of the largest music publishers, does not necessarily hold the rights to every composition recorded and released by Warner Music. However, the publishing arm owns the rights to numerous songs and entire catalogs written and composed by artists on other labels. Warner Chappell generates revenue via royalties paid for five usage categories: performance of live or broadcast versions of a song; digital for streaming or downloads; mechanical for physical media; synchronization for use in filmed media, video games, or merchandising; and other for sheet music and other publishing. Given the smaller investment in scouting and development, and lower overall risk, music publishers generally take a much smaller cut of the royalties than their recorded music siblings, spanning from as high as 50% for newer songwriters to 25% for major established ones to 5% for simple copyright registration and administration.Music copyrights have generally been upheld and even strengthened by regulatory and judiciary bodies in most of the largest music markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Europe. In the U.S., the Copyright Royalty Board in 2018 significantly raised the royalty rates paid to publishers through 2022. The same body decided that the royalty rates will be raised again gradually from 2023 through 2027. The European Union passed a directive in 2019 that safeguards the right of copyright-holders and artists to be fairly compensated for the use of their recording and compositions when uploaded to user-generated content sites like YouTube. Given the relative unpopularity of large technology firms like Google and Apple, we expect that copyright law with respect to music will continue to rule in favor rightsholders and artists.","Warner Music Group operates in a highly competitive marketplace against two firms with slightly more financial and development resources. Warner is the only stand-alone player among them and could be at a disadvantage in recruiting new talent. The record label model depends on the ability of Warner and its employees to discover, develop, market, and promote new and existing talent. If Warner is unable to find new talent or hold on to its existing artists, returns will suffer. Warner depends on streaming revenue, Spotify and Apple in particular, which combined account for more than 30% of revenue. If there is a dispute with either service, Warners revenue would be severely affected. Additionally, any negative change to the royalty rates paid by the streaming service would also hit revenue. These royalty rates are often set at the country level, though, diversifying the risk of a negative impact.Warners revenue growth depends on the continued adoption of streaming. Any reduction in the adoption rate or switch to piracy by consumers would hurt the firm.Potential ESG risks for the company center around copyrights and licensing. Warners business involves the ownership and monetization of royalty rights. There has and will likely continue to be public and regulatory interest in seemingly low royalty payouts from labels to artists. While we dont expect any legal changes in the relationship between artists and labels, there is a risk that artists could rally enough public pressure to force labels to increase the royalty payouts.","We assign Warner Music Group an Exemplary capital allocation rating. Our rating is driven primarily by the likelihood that Warner adds value through its investments but also takes into account the shape of its balance sheet and its shareholder distribution policies.We view Warners balance sheet as sound, with $3.3 billion of net debt as of the end of fiscal 2023. This places the net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3 times, a reasonable level in our view for a business that isnt capital intensive. The firm only remerged a publicly traded firm in June 2020 with less than 25% shares being floated. As a result, the firm has not repurchased any shares since the IPO. Warner music does pay a modest divided with a yield of around 2%. In contrast, the firm is looking to make acquisitions and investments. Since the controlling shareholder, Access, took over in 2011, Warner has made over 15 strategic acquisitions of various sizes, with the $800 million acquisition of Parlophone Label Group as the largest. Other purchases have helped WMG expand its reach into local markets across the globe and expand into digital media, such as via Uproxx. Warner also buys back catalogs and publishing rights on a regular basis. The firms acquisitions have helped to improve returns over the last decade.","Warner Music Group is the third largest of the three major global record labels, with Vivendis Universal Music in first and Sony Music in second. Warners larger segment, recorded music, consists of iconic labels like Atlantic Records, Warner Records, and Parlophone Records and popular artists such as Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Dua Lipa, and Blake Shelton. Warner Chappell, the firms publishing arm, is the home to over 65,000 composers and songwriters with over 1 million copyrights represented. Warner is controlled by Access Industries, which owns an 84% economic interest and 99% of voting rights.","We believe Warner Music Groups financial health is solid. The company ended fiscal 2023 with $641 million in cash and $4 billion in long-term debt. Warner generated $368 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2022 and $300 million in fiscal 2023, which we expect to return to growth over the next five years. We project cash flow allocation over the near term to be balanced among smaller acquisitions, dividends, and debt repayment.",WMG,Communication Services,17848301568.0,NMS,2620427.0,USD,33.400001525878906,True,1,31.83013574936588,34.782074351371605,1
24/11/2023,Airtacs Positive Long-Term Outlook Remains Intact,Airtac International Group,1590,2,26/10/2023,Chokwai Lee,1085.0,TWD,24/11/2023,900.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,,26/10/2023,"Narrow-moat AirTACs cumulative nine-month net profit of TWD 5.27 billion was up 13% year on year and in line with our expectation. We slightly raise our fair value estimate to TWD 900 from TWD 870 after considering a better sales growth outlook in 2024-25. However, we think the shares remain overvalued currently, with a positive demand outlook largely priced in. In our view, the market could be disappointed with the slower-than-expected sales growth for its linear guide products. Our valuation for AirTAC implies a 2024 P/E ratio of about 21 times, versus its five-year historical trading range of around 14 times to 40 times. There are a few highlights. First, while AirTAC should be able to achieve its double-digit year-on-year revenue growth guidance for 2023, its operating margin target was slightly lowered to around 30% from greater than 30%, partly dragged by higher labor costs. Second, revenue from linear guide products will be below the CNY 500 million target for 2023, but management expects stronger growth in 2024 given accelerating sales in recent months with the expansion into distributor channels. There will be more orders from the direct customers as well. Third, AirTAC believes operating margin should continue to rise in coming quarters on the back of improving efficiency and a higher utilization rate for the linear guide production. Management thinks the firm can still enjoy double-digit revenue growth for the next 10 years, to be underpinned by the introduction of electric cylinders and two new automation components in the coming years. Overall, this is in line with our revenue CAGR forecast of 14.8% for 2022-27. For 2024, AirTAC expects stronger demand growth from the electronics industry as demand has been weak for the past few years. Meanwhile, demand from the energy and lighting segment should continue to see robust growth, supported by strong growth in the solar and LED industries.","5G-related demand (for smartphones and base stations) and pent-up capital expenditure in China will increase demand for pneumatic products, and AirTAC should be a main beneficiary, given its leading position in the industry. New products such as electric actuators and linear guides will help AirTAC to maintain its earnings growth. AirTACs pneumatic components business should experience rapid demand growth on the back of the aging population, shortage of labor force, and rising labor costs in China.",Chinas slowing economic growth and trade tensions with the U.S. will negatively affect demand for AirTACs pneumatic components. Diversification into new products may lower AirTACs operating margin due to the gestation period and higher costs involved. AirTACs plan to grow its global market share will be a challenging task as the firm only has a stronghold in the China market.,26/10/2023,"AirTAC is the second-largest pneumatic components maker in China, with more than 20% market share in 2022. We think the firms leadership position is underpinned by its reputable brand, record, comprehensive sales network, and strong operating efficiency. Chinas pneumatic equipment sector is concentrated, with the top three players accounting for more than 65% of the market. Despite being the second-largest player in China, AirTAC is still a relatively new company compared with its peers such as Japans SMC (established in 1959 with 35% market share in China) and Germanys Festo (founded in 1925 with 12% market share). As a result, AirTACs strategy is to compete with lower selling prices while providing products with quality comparable to its foreign peers. The strategy has been successful, and the firm has increased its market share in China to more than 20% from 11% in 2011. Nonetheless, AirTAC still generates comparable gross margins to peers, thanks to its high operating efficiency and continuous efforts in lowering its production costs. AirTAC also proactively invests in product upgrades and technological know-how to keep up with customer demands and expands its products into high-end automation equipment from its current low-end to midrange focus. We think AirTAC will continue to benefit from the high demand for industrial automation in China given the rising labor costs and aging workforce. To maintain its future growth, the firm will focus on expanding its sales channels to continue to expand its China market share; growing its overseas markets to diversify its revenue streams as more than 90% of sales was generated from China currently; and increasing its product portfolio to narrow its gap with the bigger players. AirTAC aims to be among the top three global players in the pneumatic equipment sector. To achieve this, we think AirTAC will need to invest significant time and resources as leading peers have entrenched positions in the global market. The firm is venturing into peripheral markets such as electric cylinders and linear guides, but we think it is too early to expect these can improve the firms competitive position.","We believe AirTAC has a narrow economic moat, with cost advantage, switching costs, and intangible assets being the sources of competitive advantage. We think the firm will earn more than its cost of capital at least for the next decade, supported by its reputable brand, record, extensive distribution channels, and strong operating efficiency.Chinas pneumatic equipment sector is concentrated with the top three players accounting for more than 65% of the market. We believe the top players will be able to take advantage of their leading positions and earn returns higher than their weighted average costs of capital.Switching Costs to Increase Customer LoyaltyAs a leading manufacturer of pneumatic equipment that provides clients with total pneumatic solutions, we believe AirTAC benefits from switching cost advantage. The breakdown of pneumatic components will lead to productivity loss, inability to deliver services to customers and economic loss. For example, unplanned downtime is the single largest contributor to lost production time for most manufacturers. According to a study conducted by the International Society of Automation, downtime costs the global manufacturing industry approximately USD 647 billion every year. Hence, customers would prefer vendors with familiar products in order to minimize risk, rather than making risky decisions of switching vendors and dealing with new products.Besides products, the firm also provides a complete set of services to create maximum value, including studying clients existing production resources and establish improvement plan to help them save costs such as production line upgrade, implementation of automation items, maintenance and repair. Both AirTAC and the customers will eventually increase their respective knowledge about each others products and business operations over times. The entrenched relationships are win-win for both, as the suppliers can develop a stronger understanding of their customers manufacturing operations and provide better product solutions; while the customers would have developed the operational know-how to use the product(s) effectively and solve minor product issues. This mutual learning curve that develops over time creates significant switching cost for the customers as they would have to start over if they choose to switch vendors.In after-sale services, the company offers joint warranty. A buyer of AirTACs products from any distributor in China is entitled to receive technical services from any branch office in China. The firm also guarantees that a customer will receive service within 24 hours after making a request. As such, customers are ensured quality services and build trust with AirTAC in the long run.Intangible Assets to Maintain CompetitivenessAs the demand for factory automation continues to increase, track record and reputation will play a major role in the decision-making of potential customers looking to procure factory automation-related components. We think AirTACs intangible assets (well-established track record since 1988 and strong reputation as the second-largest pneumatic equipment maker in China) will help the firm to continue to win new orders from customers, especially as factory automation becomes increasingly complex and requires more communication between both parties.The company will not be able to survive in the long term if it just focusses in low pricing strategy. As such, AirTAC has been focusing in research and development activities to improve its competitive advantage and maintain its leadership position. The firm has been proactively investing in product upgrades and technological know-how. In 2022, AirTACs research and development investment was about 2.8% of revenue. This allows the firm to keep up with customer demands and expands its products into high-end automation equipment from its current low-end to midrange focus.Over the years, AirTAC has built an extensive distribution network throughout the urban and rural areas of China, with more than 130 direct sales offices and more than 500 distributors. In our view, the firms ability to maximize its reach to all customers is an important factor that support its leading position in the industry. The firm also has more than 100 distributors in Europe, the U.S. and Asia that allow it to promote the AirTAC brand in global markets.De-emphasizing but Maintaining Cost Advantage as a Moat SourceDespite being the second largest pneumatic equipment maker in China, AirTAC is still a relatively new company compared with its peers such as Japans SMC (established in 1959) and Germanys Festo (founded in 1925). As a result, AirTACs strategy is to compete with lower selling prices while providing products with quality comparable to its foreign peers. The strategy has been successful, and the firm has grown its market share in China from 11% in 2011 to more than 20% in 2022.We believe AirTACs strong operational efficiency allows it to offer lower selling prices than foreign peers, while still generates comparable gross margins to SMC, a commendable achievement in our view given that SMC is the largest pneumatic components manufacturer in the world (about 39% market share) and China (about 35% market share). In fact, the firms average gross margin during 2012-22 was impressive at 50.5% versus SMCs 48.8% during fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2021 (ended March 2022). In addition to improving economies of scale, we think the firms continuous efforts in lowering its production costs also play an important role. AirTAC is vertical integrated from design, research and development, to mass production. As such, the firm can reduce the time needed for product development and production processed, which allows it to meet customers needs in timely manner. In particular, more than 80% of parts needed are manufactured in-house by AirTAC, which helps to save additional production costs. The firm will evaluate the costs and benefits of manufacturing parts in-house or purchasing them from third parties. If vertical integration is feasible, the company will produce the accessories internally to enhance its competitiveness.AirTACs research and development department and production teams constantly work together to improve the manufacturing process (such as cutting wastage of raw materials and reducing labor hours) to raise efficiency and lower costs. The firm has also been increasing automation for its production system to ensure consistent product quality and reduce labor cost.However, we think being vertically integrated is not an insurmountable barrier to entry although this provides a modest cost advantage that will restrict, but probably not eliminate, new entrants. We believe that as AirTAC move up the value chain to high-end automation equipment from its current low-end to midrange focus, its clients will be less price sensitive but instead focus on product reliability and record. In addition, we think competitors can also copy the firms strategy to be vertically integrated, albeit it will take times to achieve the level of operating efficiency similar to AirTAC.","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High to AirTAC, based on AirTACs fundamental exposure to the economy and economic cycles, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system. More than 90% of AirTACs sales are generated from China in 2022 and the firm will be affected by the countrys macroeconomic conditions, in our view.We believe one of the main earnings risks for the firm will be irrational price competition among peers. However, given that Chinas pneumatic equipment sector is concentrated (the top three players accounting for more than 65% of the market), we think intense price competition is unlikely as it will do more harm than good for the major players.Similarly, if the global economic growth is weak, this will hit AirTACs sales as capital expenditure for the firms clients will slow down. That said, we think long-term demand for the firms product will remain robust on the back of the ageing population, shortages of labor, and rising costs of workers in China.A fluctuation in raw material costs (such as aluminum, copper, and steel) and labor expenses will dampen AirTACs earnings as these typically account for around 70% of cost of sales. The firm seldom passes through the increased costs to customers as it prefers to expand its market share and absorb the costs through improvements in operating efficiency.We think AirTAC's key environmental, social, and governance risks (captured in our Uncertainty Rating) include product governance and human capital. Of these two, we believe product governance has a higher chance of occurring, given that product defects can result in operational disruptions for the companys customers, leading to reputation and compensation issues.","We view AirTACs capital allocation actions as Exemplary, given the companys record in growing its business and efficiency in capital allocation. Wang Shih-Chung, together with other partners, founded the company in 1989 focusing on production of valve products. The firm ventured into pneumatic components in 1992 and has become the second-largest pneumatic equipment manufacturer in China, with revenue of TWD 26.1 billion in 2022. The firm was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 2010 and management and related parties hold about 31% of the total shares outstanding.In order to expand its business in China, AirTACs strategy is to compete with lower selling prices while providing products with quality comparable to its foreign peers. The strategy has been successful, and the firm has grown its China market share to about 26% in 2022, just behind SMCs 35%. This is a testament to managements capability as the pneumatic industry is highly competitive with the global market dominated by SMC from Japan, Parker Hannifin from the U.S., and Festo from Germany. The company continues to focus on improving its operating efficiency, and the firms average gross margin during 2012-22 was impressive at 50.5%. On the other hand, the firm is disciplined in its capital expenditure, with recent expansion focus on venturing into peripheral markets such as electric actuators and linear guides to diversify its revenue streams.We think AirTAC has a comfortable balance sheet. Its net gearing ratio was about 0.12 times at the end of 2022. We believe AirTACs balance sheet strength will remain healthy, given its positive operating cash flow.As for shareholder distributions, AirTACs historical payout ratios (including stock dividends) were around 35%-62% during 2011-22. We think this is about right in rewarding shareholders as the firm still needs to retain some capital to execute its strategy.","Established in Taiwan in 1989, AirTAC International Group specializes in producing actuators, control components, air preparation products, and accessories, which are widely used in industrial automation, including industries such as automotive, machinery manufacturing, electronics, lighting and textile, medical equipment and food and packaging.

24/11/2023,"Without Film or TV Studios or a Streaming Service, Fox Relies Almost Entirely on News and Sports",Fox Corp,FOXA,4,02/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,30.36,USD,23/11/2023,43.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,02/11/2023,"Fox continued to increase revenue in its fiscal first quarter, despite tough comparisons from the political election season in the same period last year and a continuing trend of declining cable subscriptions. Pricing strength and the success of Tubi, the firms free streaming service, offset the headwinds. We are maintaining our $43 fair value estimate. Total revenue was up less than 1% year over year, with 2% growth in affiliate revenue more than offsetting a 2% decline in advertising revenue. We suspect the success the firm is having with Tubi, its ad-supported streaming service, helped blunt the lack of political ads in the quarter. Management said the womens World Cup and timing of college football broadcasts also boosted ad revenue. We believe the firms heavy reliance on news and sports, which lend themselves to live viewing, will continue to support pricing for Fox ad revenue, though declining paid-TV subscriptions should continue to limit the ad revenue upside from television broadcasts. Similar dynamics affected affiliate fees in the quarter, though strong pricing on subscription renewals more than offset subscriber declines. More importantly, the firm remains in a strong negotiating position with distributors. Management said it had one third of its renewals coming due this fiscal year, and it has come to agreement on virtually all of them without going off the air during negotiations. With its ownership of Fox News, which continues to lead among cable news network viewership, and several sports properties, notably the NFL and college football, we believe the firm will remain well positioned to expand affiliate revenue through pricing power. Margins were under pressure during the quarter, with the adjusted EBITDA margin contracting to 27% from 34% last year. Higher sports programming rights and production costs were responsible for the pressure, and we anticipate these higher costs will be ongoing issues.","Fox News remains the king of the cable news hill and the firm can leverage its strong ratings and audience loyalty to grow affiliate fees. Fox owns one of four major national broadcast networks that are the only television outlets capable of reaching almost all 130 million households in the U.S. Between Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox network, Fox can offer content that appeals to almost any viewer, making the firms channel bundle must-have content for almost all pay television distributors.","Critics of Fox News and of specific hosts have led multiple boycotts of advertisers. Some of these boycotts have been very successful in causing larger corporations to cancel their advertising on the channel and specific shows. Some of these advertisers have not returned. Fox is the only one of the four major broadcasters without a significant affiliated production studio. The firm will be squeezed by outside studios that will pass through increased production costs. Fox overpaid when it renewed its NFL rights in 2021, which may depress margins through 2033, when the deal expires.",09/10/2023,"After selling its film, television studios, and various other entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, Fox now consists exclusively of the Fox network, 28 local TV stations, Fox News Group, Fox Sports, Tubi, and investments in related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The slimmer firm represents a large bet on the viability of live sports and news, as we project that the cable networks, including Fox News and FS1, will generate the vast majority of operating income. We believe these bets are well placed, but Fox is now undiversified relative to other media firms. Fox News has been the top cable news network for over 20 years, exhibiting similar strength through both Republican and Democratic U.S. presidential administrations. Despite the loss of founding CEO Roger Ailes in 2017, the network has continued to rank number one in cable network across all age groups in both prime-time and daytime. As the dominant television source for viewers seeking a Republican viewpoint, we expect the network to retain its spot at the top of the cable news pyramid, allowing Fox to increase the affiliate fees while maintaining carriage at both traditional and online pay-TV distributors. Foxs attempt to beat ESPN, FS1, has not yet reached and may never meet that lofty target, but the network has established itself as a competitor in the cable sports wars. FS1 owns the rights to several sports, including MLB, college sports, and soccer. While we expect Fox to continue acquiring rights, we believe the channel faces an uphill struggle against a much larger competitor in ESPN and newer rivals like Amazon, especially as the media landscape evolves toward streaming. While the Fox broadcast network still owns major sports rights, including the NFL, Fox is now the only one of the four major broadcasters without an affiliated full-scale production studio. We believe Fox can source new shows from other studios, including independents such as Lionsgate. However, we are more skeptical than management that Fox will be able to obtain ownership rights to every new show, given the high demand for new shows from traditional and streaming outlets.  ","We assign Fox a narrow moat rating based on the intangibles moat source. One of our guiding premises in media is that the value of content continues to increase even as the distribution markets mutate. Despite changes in distribution, pay television penetration remains above 50% of roughly 130 million U.S. households. Even without a pay television subscription, many cord-cutters still consume video content and manyNielsen estimates around 18 million householdsuse antennas to capture signals, providing content creators with an additional avenue to generate revenue from these viewers. Given the ongoing demand for content, we believe content creation is not a zero-sum game, as high-quality content will always find an outlet.The sale of Twenty First Century Foxs entertainment assets to Disney has created a unique media firm in Fox. The firm is now heavily focused on live events, notably news and sports, through Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, and Big Ten Network. Fox's competitive advantage lies in its national broadcast network and cable networks. We view Fox News as the crown jewel among the corporations assets. The news channel has leveraged its hold over Republican-leaning viewers to become the number one ranked cable network among all age groups for both the prime time and all-day time slots for the last seven years. Fox News benefited from the contentious atmosphere surrounding the Trump presidential administration and the widening political gap between the two parties. However, the channel has finished as the top cable news network for more than 20 years, spanning both Democratic and Republican U.S. presidential administrations. Management used these ratings to drive significant growth in the channels affiliate fees, which expanded from $0.58 per customer per month in 2009 to $1.72 in 2020 per SNL Kagan. We expect that the firm will continue to leverage strong ratings and audience loyalty to grow affiliate fees for Fox News faster than the average pay-TV channel. The company owns one of four major national broadcast networks and affiliated TV stations in 17 markets. While network ratings have declined over the past decade, broadcast networks are the only television outlet capable of reaching almost all households in the U.S. Network ratings still outpace cable ratings and provide advertisers with one of the only remaining methods for quickly reaching a large number of consumers in one place. This makes the broadcast networks key partners for sports leagues, as the channels provide access to the largest potential audience and can best monetize the rights. Fox has a strong portfolio of sports rights including NFL (Sunday afternoon), MLB, FIFA World Cup, college football, college basketball, and Nascar. The term for these rights varies from three to 10 years. While leagues are always looking for new partners, current holders do tend to hold on to the rights if interested in continuing the relationship. This is due in part to the invested infrastructure, the known quantity and quality of the relationship, branding, and the incumbents ability to monetize the rights without heavily investing in marketing. Among the firms other cable assets, we think that the Fox Sports networks, FS1 and FS2, have the largest opportunity to generate economic profits. We believe that the Murdoch family wanted to hold the channels to enhance its position when negotiating with both traditional and internet-based pay television distributors. The channels remain well behind ESPN in terms of total audience, but have made inroads as the firm has spent money on sports rights including MLB, college football, college basketball, and soccer. Similar to ESPN and ABC for Disney, we expect the FOX broadcast network and FS1 to continue to share talent and sports rights with the biggest games on Fox and other contests on FS1 and FS2. Fox does not own a major production studio, and management does not plan to build one. Instead, the broadcast network will be buying much of its general entertainment content from third-party studios. We expect that Fox will try to continue to work with more independent studios like Lionsgate or Sony Pictures and will look to finance some of its productions in order to retain syndication and streaming rightsmuch like Netflix did early on in its pivot toward original content. However, we think that the firm will find it difficult to compete in the increasingly tight market for talent within television production as it no longer owns platforms for edgier content, similar to the way its predecessor used FX and FXX (now part of Disney). While the Murdochs did turn Fox into a bet on the value of live sports and news, the strategy is also a bet on the continued viability of the pay television bundle. Due to its lack of a studio and the sale of its content library to Disney, the firm has little to no ability to compete in the subscription streaming marketplace. However, Fox does own Tubi, a free ad-supported streaming television, or FAST, service that is available in North and Central America, Australia, and New Zealand. While FAST platforms like Tubi have grown rapidly over the last five years, the space is getting more crowded and other media firms, such as Paramount with Pluto, own deeper content libraries that can be used to populate the service. Additionally, FAST platforms are facing competition for ad revenue from subscription services like Netflix and Disney+ that have lower priced ad-supported tiers. Between Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox network, Fox can offer content that appeals to almost any viewer, making the firms channel bundle must have content for most pay television distributors. We note that the firms channels are a key part of the bundle on every major online pay-television platform, including YouTube TV, Hulu, and Sling, a spot we expect that the networks will retain for the foreseeable future.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Fox is High. The new business models proliferating throughout the media sector could diminish Fox's revenue growth or profitability. Viewership of its programs could fall below expectations, and advertisers could pull back on their spending, both of which could drag on advertising sales growth. Without control of a production studio, Fox may struggle to respond to these trends. The Fox broadcast network is highly leveraged to sports content to draw viewers and maintain leverage with distributors. The cost of sports rights has continued to skyrocket, putting pressure on margins. Fox News is performing very well today, but advertisers could flee from the network due to boycotts or controversial commentary from on-air talent. The older viewer base could cap the ability of the network to grow ad revenue and hinder its ability in the future to replace advertisers if more buyers abandon Fox News or its hosts.Rupert Murdoch recently announced he was retiring from the board of Fox, but he still controls a large percentage of the voting power despite a much smaller economic interest in the company. Rupert's son, Lachlan Murdoch, will now serve as sole chairman and CEO. We believe that Rupert Murdoch will structure his estate to ensure his family remains in charge upon his passing. Still, whenever Rupert no longer has a voice in the firm's direction, it will remain to be seen whether Lachlan and potentially other beneficiaries will be able to steer the firm as well as the patriarch has.","We assign Fox a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, driven primarily by the likelihood that Fox adds value through investments but also accounting for the shape of its balance sheet and its shareholder distributions.While the firm increased its debt load during the pandemic, we view the balance sheet as sound. The firm ended June 2023 with about $3 billion in net debt,a very manageable amount for a firm that has generated about $1.5 billion or more free cash flow each year since 2019. We think that the firm would be willing to increase leverage to make large-scale acquisitions and that it has the ability to do so. The wisdom of any such move would depend on the details. The firm returned over $4 billion to shareholders each year since fiscal 2020. Fox bought back $2 billion shares in fiscal 2023 while a declining share count reduced the dividend payout to $299 million despite modestly increasing per-share amounts. While we viewed the shares as undervalued during much of this period, we think that Fox should be allocating more of its cash flow to investing in sports rights and rebuilding its content creation engines. Fox operates in a highly competitive landscape in which many of its peers have already transitioned to a direct-to-consumer focus or added a DTC offering like Disney+, Peacock (NBCUniversal), or Paramount+. While the firm does have Fox Nation, a DTC version of its popular news channel, the lack of studios or a content library (both of which were sold to Disney) constraints Foxs ability to create a compelling general-audience DTC service. Instead, Fox represents a large-scale bet on the value of sports and news. While this bet may pay off, the firm should be heavily investing in sports rights and its news operations in order to give the bet the best chance of succeeding. Fox currently has retained its critical Sunday afternoon NFL rights through 2033 but it lost its Thursday night games to Amazon for the 2022 season. The cable sports channels have lost the UEFA Champions and Europa League rights to CBS despite having rights to the next two World Cups. Fox was also outbid by NBC for the English Premier League rights in 2021. In 2021, ESPN added the NHL and renewed its NFL rights with ESPN+ gaining games from both leagues. The lack of a DTC platform and increased competition for rights may cause Fox to overbid for sports rights and thus affect margins. We also remain concerned about one-off and haphazard investments. At the predecessor company, management made a series of ill-fated acquisitions like Myspace, IGN, and Photobucket that were tangentially related to the core business. While some of the recent acquisitions like Tubi make sense, others like Credible Labs, a personal finance site, leave us scratching our heads.","Fox represents the assets not sold to Disney by predecessor firm, Twenty First Century Fox, in 2019. The remaining assets include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations of which 17 are affiliated with the Fox Network, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market. ","After increasing its debt load during fiscal 2021 and 2022, Fox reduced debt in 2023 and ended the fiscal year with less than $3 billion in net debt, a very manageable amount for a firm that has generated about $1.5 billion or more free cash flow each year since 2019. We expect that Fox will continue to pay a semiannual dividend, as it should have the ability to generate strong free cash flow. However, Fox could choose to reinvest cash flow into creating its own television production studio, like CBS did after its split from Viacom in 2006. We note that the investment into CBS Studios helped CBS to diversify away from its initial dependence on advertising revenue. The firm could also hoard the cash to help pay for the increased cost of sports rights, as it competes with much larger firms for these rights.",FOXA,Communication Services,14128436224.0,NMS,5336951.0,USD,30.36000061035156,True,1,31.314019775391763,29.9392864086,0
24/11/2023,"Hannovers Cost Leadership Is Gradually Eroding, and It Is Compensating Through Pure Underwriting",Hannover Rueck SE,HVRRY,3,09/11/2023,Henry Heathfield,117.91,USD,23/11/2023,115.0,Medium,,Standard,,09/11/2023,"Hannover Re has reported a strong set of earnings for the first 9 months as net income has risen to EUR 1.4 billion, leaving Hannover Re slightly ahead of our EUR 1.6 billion full-year forecast. Risk-adjusted price rises that the business has achieved in property and casualty renewals over the year, along with lighter major losses of EUR 1.2 billion versus the EUR 1.3 billion budget, have helped. However, so has a double-digit rise in investment income, leaving the business on track to achieve its guidance for full-year operating profit of EUR 1.6 billion. Group investment income looks to be below our full-year forecast. In life and health reinsurance it has mainly been the financial solutions business, as well as some longevity, that has driven a better result. A life and health reinsurance operating profit of EUR 730 million leaves the business well on track versus our EUR 808 million full-year forecast. The group's return on equity so far this year is 15%, just shy of 20% annualized. Both are above the 11% cost of equity we apply. We maintain our EUR 220 per-share fair value estimate and no moat rating. Shares are fairly valued.","Hannover has a history of leadership in an expense-based cost advantage. While that leadership has depleted over recent years, the company has gained what it has lost in its claims-based underwriting. Hannover does have a history of underwriting specialist reinsurance lines. While the importance of specialty looks like it may have slightly fallen by the wayside, we anticipate it will always be core to the business.","Hannovers expense-based cost leadership is theoretically replicable, as peers could also move to a low-cost location. Hannover has been one of the worst performers in terms of its claims and pricing-based underwriting, by quite a convincing margin. While we like Hannovers preference for organic growth, the companys track record for acquisitions is patchy. This led to ongoing long-term life and health reinsurance problems.",01/11/2023,"Hannover is probably one of the most efficiently run reinsurers in our European reinsurance coverage. The business is based in a low-cost location and the number of employees that support the business is more efficient than at large peers. We believe that the combination of its low-cost location, lean and flat structure, organic growth over acquisitions, and homogenous technology make it the most expense-efficient European reinsurer we cover. Versus larger peers, we think Hannover is a more agile, nimbler organization, and its focus on brokers as its primary channel would support this claim. Through these brokers, Hannover supports insurance companies, mutuals, and governments as clients. While Hannover has developed a cost leadership, the business has lagged behind its peers in terms of risk selection, mitigation, and pricing. In terms of the prices it receives versus the claims that it pays, Hannover is the worst European reinsurance underwriter. Quality of data is important in insurance and reinsuranceand when combined with powerful proprietary technology can form a strong competitive advantage. Adverse or favorable claims can be very impactful. While Hannover has developed a large number of pricing tools internally, we think the company hasnt historically quite got this part of the business right. That may have changed over the last five years, but against a backdrop of hardening markets, it is difficult to elucidate definitively. The data would indicate that while Hannover initially benefited from the hardening of the market the underwriting standards of peers are catching up and Hannover is middling at best. In recent years, the same can be said for Hannovers expense rate. Hannover does earn excess returns, just, if we adjust for the higher average level of investment returns. However, our expectation is that its cost leadership is shrinking, and it probably wont be there in 10 years time. Expense-based competitive advantages seem hard to defend in insurance because unlike in the cost of goods sold, they are not truly nonreplicable.","We award Hannover No Economic Moat.Like its owner, Talanx, Hannover Re operates from a low-cost location, in Hannover Germany. The amount of money Hannover spends on rent is likely substantially lower than it otherwise would be if the business was located in a more attractive, higher-profile city, such as Munich. In the same vein, we think Hannover spends comparably less on its personal expenses, as a direct consequence of this lower-cost location.If we look at personnel expenses alone, Hannover spends around 2% of the insurance premium it earns on personnel, and this stacks up well compared with the around 7% spent on personnel by its peer in Munich. We think this is one of the main drivers of the companys lower expense ratio. This lower expense ratio has also afforded the business the ability to grow at a faster pace than peers, likely putting those cost savings into pricing.Hannover management has referred to the business as the Ryanair of reinsurance and this has enabled the company to develop its property and casualty market share from around 5% around 10 years ago to a little over 10% today. Along with its low-cost location, the company places a strong emphasis on homogenous information technology throughout the organization, and the business' track record of organic growth and light acquisitions means that the company spends little on restructurings and integrations. This focus on organic growth is a feature we like and means personnel are left to focus on their day-to-day roles, delivering on the core activities of the firm, with limited distractions. This, Hannover advises, leads to low staff turnover and longer broker and client relationships.While we think Hannover is a business that is less oriented toward natural disaster reinsurance, and Hannovers balance sheet and combined ratio stability would support this, and that the company has strong positions in marine & aviation and credit & surety, we think the company has been more prevalent in writing treaty business as well as structured reinsurance. Over the last five years, Hannover has grown structured reinsurance by around 30% per year.Structured reinsurance is designed with executives to deliver bespoke reinsurance solutions. We think the fundamentals of this business line are to provide ceding companies with solutions for solvency relief and other capital efficiency. These look like sticky products where consistent service would be a benefit.We think structured reinsurance solutions have historically carried higher loss ratios than the rest of its property and casualty reinsurance portfolio, with maximum tolerable combined ratios of between 95% and 100%. This is versus a historical 95% and below for many other parts of the companys property and casualty reinsurance. However, while the writing of structured reinsurance has historically led to the degradation of Hannovers property and casualty combined ratio by up to almost 1 percentage point, our belief is that over the last five years, Hannover has gotten better and better at writing this business. Hannover wrote three alternative risk transfer transactions in 2017 that totaled close to EUR 1 billion in gross premiums written. And ever since this time as peers have been impacted by ever-rising costs of natural catastrophes and the soft market in which their covers were being written, Hannover has comparably improved its claims rate. While over the long term Hannover may be one of the worst performing of our European reinsurers in terms of underwriting, over the medium term, the business has been much better performing. These structured reinsurance transactions carry higher commissions, and against a backdrop of an ever-improving admin expense ratio, that has led to a rise in the expense ratio part of Hannovers underwriting. That has meant that Hannovers headroom between its costs and the costs of peers has been somewhat depleted. However, with its low-cost location, lean structure, and centralized underwriting, the company still benefits from around a 1.5 percentage point expense advantage.Over the next 10 years, we do expect Hannover to be among the leaders in terms of the quality of its underwriting as proxied by its combined ratio, and we also expect that moving toward underwriting leadership is more likely to come from a better balance between lower expenses as well as better pricing over payments for claims. Hannover has continued to improve the amount of money it spends on claims versus the amount it charges clients in pricing, and we think this could be the result of increased retrocession effectiveness. However, as the business remains not a leader in terms of its pricing and claims, it is difficult for us to award it a moat.","We assign Hannover a Medium Uncertainty Rating.While a 1-in-250-year United States hurricane would cost the business around EUR 2 billion, that would only cost the business 50 basis points in terms of average return on equity. We think one of the larger risks to our fair value estimate for Hannover is that when the firm reaches a 20% property and casualty market share and decides to slow down its pace of growth and focus on improving its standards of underwriting, at this time the business might not be able to get the desired lines of business or price. In this scenario, there are no improvements to the companys property and casualty standards of underwriting, and Hannover delivers a long-term 99.8% combined ratio.We think the other large risk posed to the earnings of this firm lies in its reinsurance of life and health. With the acquisition of the Scottish Re and ING Re portfolios, Hannover ended up with long-term and ongoing problems in its United States mortality reinsurance. Trends in life and health reinsurance business can be hard to predict, price, and manage effectively and timely. Changing trends in mortality as a result of externalities such as increased heart disease and unintentional deaths such as suicides and opioid overdose crop up by no fault of the firm. While in our base case, we believe Hannover will return to a long-term standard of underwriting that the business has achieved over the 10 years leading into the rise of coronavirus, in our bear case we forecast the best years are well and truly behind them. Adverse underwriting standards coming out of post-level-term and yearly-renewable-term, pandemics, and rising deaths from drug overdose and heart disease are the norm rather than the exception in this scenario. In this scenario, Hannovers life and health reinsurance division delivers a long-term 107.2% combined ratio. In our downside scenario, we think Hannover is worth EUR 140 per share.","OWe award Hannover a Standard capital allocation rating.Hannover has a Sound balance sheet.As of year-end 2022, Hannover held EUR 17.5 billion in eligible own funds. This covered a solvency capital requirement of EUR 6.9 billion and meant the business had 252% solvency. Hannover targets a minimum 180% solvency, and below 200% measures will be adopted in order to strengthen the balance sheet and/or reduce risk. A 100% minimum solvency is stipulated by the supervisory authority.Over the last five-plus years we believe Hannovers proportional exposure to natural catastrophes has declined. Hannovers largest natural disaster exposure is to a United States hurricane where a 1-in-100-year event could cost the business EUR 1.4 billion. Hannovers risk mitigation includes a $450 million K retrocession, a EUR 285 million whole account excess of loss cover, and $45 million of catastrophe swaps. These cover varying lines.Hannover has made Fair investments.We believe there have been two main themes to Hannovers investments over the last 10 years. Those have been investments in life and health reinsurance, followed by alterations to its specialist insurance lines in the second period.In the early part of 2010, Hannover set up a letter of credit facility with the specific idea of building on its United States ING acquisition that increased the companys exposure to mortality reinsurance. The company went on to sell its U.S. Clarendon business for EUR 200 million toward the end of the year, further bolstering its capital levels available for deployment in this initiative. The following year, Hannover purchased the U.S. mortality business from Scottish Re that covered the three underwriting years leading up to 2003. Another year later the business diversified its life and health reinsurance portfolio by purchasing a block of longevity risks from Legal and General. This Legal and General block covered the pensions of 11,500 employees of the United Kingdom business, Pilkington, that were in payment. Hannovers purchase only covered the biometric risk and did not cover investment or inflation risk. This led to a marked rise in longevity premium over the next few years as Hannover concluded another longevity transaction with Legal and General in 2013. Hannover primarily reinsurers blue-collar workers' longevity risk and uses longevity swaps to hedge its longevity risk. These life and health reinsurance investments were rounded out with a longevity risk transaction in France with AXA and the assumption of the longevity risk of the U.K.-based Pension Insurance Corporation.In July 2017, Hannover acquired Argenta Syndicate 2121, a Lloyds of London syndicate. This syndicate provides a variety of property reinsurance to small and medium-sized businesses, and large businesses predominantly in retail and manufacturing, as well as to homeowners. While the syndicate is predominantly United States focused, it doesnt provide cover to Fortune 100 companies. In casualty insurance, the syndicate covers financial institutions and professional indemnity. In marine and energy, the syndicate covers the commercial interests of upstream and midstream businesses as well as renewable risks. Marine and energy also provides (re)insurance cover for specialist items and goods in transit by air, rail, and sea and includes coverage of their storage as a normal part of their transit. Specie protects individuals' and organizations' high-value assets such as fine art, collectibles, jewelry, and precious metals. Clients for specie include major museums and private collectors. Marine covers ship repair liability, terminal operator liability, and general marine liability. The syndicate also provides cover for utility infrastructure risks with a particular focus on U.S. situs risks. Argentas specialty book also covers cyber, engineering and construction, political, and terrorist risks.In May 2018, Hannover agreed to merge its specialty insurance business with HDI Global into HDI Global Specialty. Hannover retained a slightly less than 50% holding on the joint business and subsequently sold its stake to HDI Global in December 2021. This leaves Hannover focused on the reinsurance business.Hannover has made Fair distributions.Hannover targets a dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 40% annually with a minimum dividend of the prior year. Normal dividends are topped up with special dividends instead of buybacks for excess capital distributions. This has translated to a payout ratio of around 50% historically and has provided sensible flexibility for distributions. Hannover has around a 3% yield.","Hannover Re is a reinsurance company headquartered in Hannover, Germany. Its roots go back to the 1920s when, in conjunction with the Gerling Group, Haftplichtverband founded Eisen- und Stahl to provide reinsurance services. In the 1960s ownership of the business was turned over to Haftplichtverband and Aktiengesellschaft fur Transport und- Ruckversichering was founded. This was the basis of Hannover Re. The business expanded into life and health reinsurance in the 1990s, and over the next 30 years expanded beyond its core domestic market of Germany to write business internationally. Hannover sold its commercial specialty insurance business to Talanx on Jan. 1, 2019. Hannover was listed in the '90s on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.","Hannover has sound financial health.Hannover holds EUR 5.5 billion of debt on its balance sheet, a rise of EUR 1.1 billion since the prior year with EUR 750 million of subordinated debt with around a 6% interest rate issued last year. This is the most expensive debt on Hannovers balance sheet. A separate EUR 750 million note matures in 2028, and that is the nearest term maturity. While equity has decreased and that has led to elevated leverage, we do not expect Hannover to change the profile or magnitude of the debt it has issued. Our expectation is that as interest rates start to fall and the value of fixed-income security assets rise, Hannovers debt-to-equity will gradually fall back to a long-term rate of 35% over the next five years.",HVRRY,Financial Services,28975364096.0,PNK,885.0,USD,117.91000366210938,True,0,36.46498040591882,41.211893152304945,0
24/11/2023,Lamb Westons Low-Cost Production and Solid Execution Capitalize on Continued Growth of Fries,Lamb Weston Holdings Inc,LW,4,20/11/2023,Kristoffer Inton,98.89,USD,23/11/2023,117.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,20/11/2023,"Weve raised our fair value estimate for Lamb Weston to $117 per share from $74, after updating our forecasts for higher volume growth (about 200 basis points more per year to 4.5%) and revisiting our cost of equity assumption (down to 7% from 9.5%, which is more in line with most food producers). Shares traded near our fair value estimate as recently as May, and we think the market now undervalues its long-term growth potential while overvaluing cost and crop volatility. Our fair value estimate implies 21.5 times adjusted price/earnings and 12.5 times enterprise value/adjusted EBITDA off our fiscal 2024 estimates. For fiscal 2024, we forecast organic sales growth of about 7.5%, as the tail end of inflation-driven price increases offsets the resulting volume declines. After that, we forecast organic revenue growth of about 6.5% per year, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and inflation-level price increases. We expect volume growth from higher menu attachment rates, new products, and growing international consumption per capita. We forecast the adjusted EBITDA margin to recover to 23% at midcycle from high-capacity utilization, overhead expense leverage, and the end of sharp inflation-related price increases. We do not expect margins to expand beyond that, given the commoditized nature of its products and the strong buyer power of some of its customers. We maintain Lamb Westons narrow economic moat rating based on cost advantage and entrenched customer relationships. It primarily sources its raw potatoes from the Columbia Basin and Idaho regions at 10% to 20% lower costs per pound. Its position is protected by the difficulty in securing water rights for new agriculture and longstanding farmer relationships. In addition, we think Lamb Weston enjoys entrenched customer relationships, particularly with national quick service restaurants that are willing to pay for consistency and quality, a reputation Lamb Weston has earned with decades of performance.","Lamb Westons products generate high margins for restaurants, increasing their loyalty and willingness to pay for consistency and quality. Given the popularity of potato products, restaurants are willing to experiment with new innovations, creating future demand and greenfield potential. Lamb Westons geographical cost advantages protect it from potential price wars while the quality of its products add demonstrable incremental value to customers menus.","Lamb Westons overwhelming exposure to potatoes creates significant risk from short-term volatility, especially in the form of subpar growing seasons or crop disease. While potatoes are popular now, Lamb Westons sales prospects could be tarnished if consumer tastes change, and its innovation fails to keep pace. Lamb Westons doesnt grow its own potatoes, weakening its ability to maintain consistency from season to season.",20/11/2023,"Lamb Weston offers investors pure-play exposure to the frozen potato market as North Americas largest producer (with more than 40% share), followed by McCain (30%), Simplot (20%), and Cavendish (7%-8%) though it trails McCain globally. The company primarily sells French fries to other businesses like quick service restaurants. Despite its niche focus, we view frozen potatoes as boasting robust demand growth and balanced supply. Historically, theres generally been enough demand for all producers to operate at high-capacity utilization rates, reducing the need to compete on price. Moreover, Lamb Weston primarily sources its raw potatoes from the Columbia Basin and Idaho regions, the two regions with the highest crop yields, leading to 10% to 20% lower costs per pound. Its position is protected by the difficulty in securing water rights for new agriculture. And while it doesnt grow most of its own, multiyear contracts as well as long-standing relationships with farmers are likely to keep its supply position protected. Global frozen potato demand grew at a robust 5% per year before the pandemic, and we see tailwinds that should support a return to high growth. First, while 42% of global menus feature French fries, only 23% of U.S. restaurants offer the item, offering expansion opportunities. Second, the item is popular across all ages, which should drive incremental sales if added to menus. Third, fries are a profitable addition to restaurants with one of the highest contribution margins at 81%. Lastly, new product innovations for both fries (coated, different shapes, etc.) as well as other products (e.g., Dominos Loaded Tots and potatoes for Starbucks breakfast items) should help expand the addressable market. While just 15% of fiscal 2023 sales, we think Lamb Westons retail business is a logical ancillary to its primary business-to-business strategy. Retail frozen potatoes is led by Kraft-Heinzs Ore-Ida brand, though Lamb Weston takes the top share of nearly 33% when including its private-label business, making it an important partner for grocers. Through product innovation and brand licenses, the company has grown its share while also expanding margins.","We assign Lamb Weston a narrow economic moat rating based on cost advantage and intangible assets via entrenched customer relationships.Quantitatively in support of our contention, returns on invested capital including goodwill averaged about 20% from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019. Furthermore, even as the pandemic drove restaurant traffic down sharply, returns fell below 11% but remained well above our 7% estimate for the firms cost of capital. As pandemic restrictions have ended, Lamb Westons ROICs recovered to 17%, a level that we forecast it will maintain over the next five years.Lamb Westons cost advantage stems from its potato supply sources. About 60% of its potatoes come from the Columbia Basin, which stretches across Washington, Oregon, and Western Idaho. The Columbia Basin is prolific for growing potatoes given its unique soil, steady irrigation from the Columbia River, and long sunny days matched with cool evenings. The rest of North American potato production sits at a similar latitude but east of the Columbia Basin. In general, as production goes east, conditions become less ideal as they dont enjoy Columbias soil, irrigation, and weather advantages. Another 20% comes from Idaho, which has similar growing advantages. Given the ideal conditions, high yields lead to 10% to 20% lower costs per pound. The remaining 20% of Lamb Westons North American supply comes from Alberta and the Upper Midwest, which dont generate the same cost advantages but still provide additional supply and some diversification.Lamb Weston does not grow most of its own potatoes, but we think its cost advantage is durable for at least the next 10 years for a few reasons. First, the company has multiyear contracts (ranging from a few years upward to 10) with its farmers, many of which are set to automatically renew. Second, retention rates are very high as the company has rarely lost farmers to competitors. Third, potatoes are limited to 150 to 200 miles of shipping to maintain their quality. Lamb Westons existing processing footprint is overindexed to the Northwest United States, making it a natural buyer to that regions potatoes. Lastly, we think the threat of new production in the Columbia Basin and Idaho regions is limited. Although there is land available, obtaining water rights from local regulators and municipalities for new agricultural production is very difficult, weakening the potential for new supply in the region.In addition, we think Lamb Weston has an intangible asset in the form of entrenched customer relationships, particularly with national quick service restaurants. French fries are an important menu item for most restaurants, with an 81% average contribution margin that is among the highest for side dishes and appetizers. Thus, customers are willing to pay for consistency and quality to keep eaters happy, a reputation Lamb Weston has earned with multidecade relationships with some of its largest customers like McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendys. Although most of these larger customers will contract with two or three suppliers through short- to medium-term contracts, they still require demonstrated product quality and proven logistics capabilities that only a few suppliers have. Admittedly, the buying power of these customers leads to an inability for Lamb Weston to raise prices much more than inflation. However, when combined with its cost advantage, a lack of pricing power doesnt prevent it from earning excess economic returns.For most food producers with moats, brand intangible assets are a common moat source. However, we think Lamb Westons primary focus on selling to other businesses (e.g., QSRs) limits its ability to create a brand. Furthermore, it only holds the third and fourth bestselling North American brands in the retail channel well behind Kraft-Heinzs Ore-Ida and McCain, according to Euromonitor. However, together with its private-label lineup, the company has the greatest share in frozen potato products at about one third of the market. And while we do not think Lamb Weston carries a strong brand, we think its likely considered an important supplier to retailers, guaranteeing its space in the freezer aisle, and providing another outlet for its products.We refrain from assigning Lamb Weston a wide moat due to the uncertainty around the food landscape. A lack of switching costs and an overexposure to a single food product category creates enough uncertainty around the competitive advantage beyond 10 years.","We assign Lamb Weston a Medium Uncertainty Rating.The biggest risk Lamb Weston faces as a food producer is commodity risk. Lamb Weston is almost entirely exposed to potatoes, so volatility in the potato crop can have a significant effect on operations. This risk is further magnified due to Lamb Westons overexposure to the Columbia Basin, and to a lesser extent, Idaho. Thus, any region-specific risks could adversely affect Lamb Weston more than its peers. Additionally, pricing is generally agreed upon before the growing season (usually in February but as early as November of the prior year) and is decided on a per-acre business. Thus, underperforming yields can have a dramatic effect on its realized input costs. For example, as recently as fiscal 2022, a poor potato crop hurt adjusted EBITDA by more than $30 million (a 250-basis-point margin hit).Lamb Weston also faces risks around its reliance on the quick service restaurant channel. Weak foot traffic, higher menu prices, or a recession could adversely affect its customers sales, thus weighing on demand for its own products.Lamb Weston also faces risk around its products, including quality and innovation. Especially among large QSRs, consistency of product is key to maintaining strong relationships. For its retail business, innovation is key to keeping consumer interest high and maintaining importance to grocers.Lamb Weston faces environmental, social, and governance risks related to the quality and safety of its products; carbon emissions particularly from food production; and labor relations. Lamb Weston also faces some risk around the healthfulness of its products. The most likely way this risk would manifest is weakening demand. However, given the long-term and multi-generational popularity of French fries, we think this risk isnt as material as it is for other food producers. We view the remaining ESG risks as not highly probable or material to affect our fair value estimate.","We rate managements capital allocation actions as Standard, considering Lamb Westons sound balance sheet, fair view on investment ability, and mixed view on shareholder distributions. Returns on invested capital, including goodwill, have remained above our estimate of its cost of capital even during pandemic restrictions that strangled demand. With a return to normal conditions, returns have recovered, and we forecast them to remain steady over the next five years, at more than double our estimated cost of capital.We assess Lamb Westons balance sheet as sound, stemming from both low unleveraged business risk and low balance sheet risk, with our forecast for average net debt/adjusted EBITDA at just under 2 times over the next three years. Primarily producing the ever-popular French fry for restaurants, the company faces low revenue cyclicality and has low operating leverage, leading to our assessment of low unleveraged business risk. Moreover, we estimate low balance sheet risk for the company. Leverage crept higher during pandemic restrictions that weighed on restaurant visits with net debt/adjusted EBITDA reaching more than 3 times in fiscal 2022. But a return to normal conditions has already brought leverage back down. Further, with less than 15% of debt maturing over the next three years and overall net debt remaining very low, we see limited risk of refinancing in the current higher interest rate environment.Additionally, we rate the companys investments as fair, allowing it to maintain its cost edge and customer relationships but dont expect to see it grow its competitive advantages. The company has not historically been very acquisitive, with the October 2022 acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in its LW EMEA joint venture for $700 million representing its largest deal. We think the deal made strategic sense to expand its international opportunities but unlikely to improve its underlying moat sources. We view the companys execution as positive, as the company has historically done a good job of finding growth opportunities, cutting costs, and growing margins. However, its pureplay focus on frozen potatoes limits the ability of its strategy to greatly improve its existing competitive position, leading to our fair rating.Lastly, we think Lamb Westons shareholder distributions have been mixed. Since its spinout from Conagra in 2016, the company has consistently paid a dividend, with the payout ratio averaging 36% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 before falling to 15% in fiscal 2023. We forecast a payout ratio of 21% over the next five years, below its stated target payout range of 25% to 35% unless it dramatically increases the dividend. The company has not been particularly active with share repurchases, with fiscal 2022 representing the only year it bought back more than $100 million. We forecast the company could have the ability to return $1.8 billion back to shareholders over the next five years in a higher dividend or share repurchases. If it did so, wed consider upgrading our view on shareholder distributions.","Lamb Weston is North Americas largest and the worlds second-largest producer of branded and private-label frozen potato products, both by volume and value. The companys portfolio is anchored by French fries, but it also sells sweet potato fries, tater tots, diced potatoes, mashed potatoes, hash browns, and chips. Nearly 70% of revenue comes from its home market of North America, with none of the other 100 countries the company sells into representing a significant share. McDonalds is Lamb Westons single largest customer at 13% of fiscal 2023 sales, with no other company representing more than 10%. Lamb Weston became an independent company in 2016 when it was spun off from Conagra.","At the end of its fiscal first-quarter 2024 (May yea-end), Lamb Westons balance sheet was in decent shape, with net debt/adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times, which falls below the companys target of up to 3.5 times. This marks a dramatic improvement from the 3.2 times at the end of fiscal 2022, which suffered from a poor potato crop.Additionally, less than 15% of debt matures in during the next three fiscal years, minimizing the risk of refinancing in the current higher interest rate environment. Barring any major deals and presuming it prioritizes debt retirement over share repurchases, we think net leverage could fall to below 2 times as soon as the end of fiscal 2025.Lamb Westons capital allocation strategy prioritizes reinvestment into the business, return of capital to shareholders, and maintaining a solid balance sheet. At about 10% of sales over the next five years, Lamb Westons capital spending is higher than most food producers given the capital intensity of its business. However, we think the company will be in a good position to make appropriate reinvestments, grow the dividend about 9% per year on average, and still have the capacity to repurchase shares or make acquisitions of up to $2.2 billion without raising debt through fiscal 2028. We note our dividend forecast implies a midcycle payout ratio of about 20%, below the companys 25% to 35% target payout ratio. We think Lamb Weston could reach this range if it desired, though it would imply a significant acceleration in dividend growth.",LW,Consumer Defensive,14626033664.0,NYQ,1638515.0,USD,98.88999938964844,True,1,94.44540180879412,103.52274124710864,1
24/11/2023," Intermodal Weakness and Margin Pressure Persist for Canadian Pacific, but Merger Outlook Positive",Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd,CP,3,,Matthew Young,98.0,CAD,23/11/2023,95.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,,No Text Available,"The Kansas City Southern merger, which creates new, seamless intermodal lanes, should yield meaningful opportunities for incremental volume growth. CEO Keith Creel, who worked with legendary operator Hunter Harrison, has pushed to instill precision railroading principles into CP's culture. Compared with trucking, shipping by rail is less expensive for long distances, is 4-5 times more fuel-efficient per ton-mile shipped, and generally has ample capacity.","Muted organic volume growth, wage inflation, and the KCS merger will make OR improvement challenging in 2023, despite hiring progress and better network fluidity. Terminal congestion has eased and CP won solid new business in 2022, but normalizing rates in the competing truckload sector, muted retailer restocking, and the recent Canadian port strike will pressure intermodal volumes in 2023. The STB oversees railroads pricing in the U.S., thus there will always be underlying risk of reregulation in terms of a policy shift to a more heavy-handed approach.",03/11/2023,"Following the appointment of railroading legend Hunter Harrison as CEO in 2012, Canadian Pacific embarked on a profitability turnaround that proved successful. Initially upon taking the helm, Harrison closed numerous intermodal terminals and hump yards to rightsize the network. He also sold nonessential rail lines, turned over leadership, and rightsized the workforce and overall asset base.  Harrison and his successoroperations expert Keith Creel (who worked alongside Harrison for 20 years)have taken CP from ranking as one of the worst Class I margin performers to among the best. We like that CEO Creel has further infused CP's culture with precision scheduled railroading principles, which stand behind the rail's progress. In 2018, CP's profitability caught up with PSR pioneer and historical margin leader Canadian National and surpassed CN in 2019 with a 60% operating ratio, or OR. CP's freight mix is rich in bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, potash and metallurgical coal. Coal has historically made up a larger proportion of CP's portfolio than it does for peer CN due to CP's agreement with Teck Resources to haul cost-advantaged export coal. Intermodal is also a key business for CP, making up around 40% of carloads and more than 20% of revenue (primarily in Canada). Although CP's intermodal growth lagged that of CN at times over the past decade, PSR-related service enhancements have driven incremental opportunities and its growth profile improved materially. As with the other Class I rails, we expect CP's strong competitive footing to support average core pricing at or above cost inflation over the long run, rising around 3%. Intermodal pricing will likely come in slightly lower due to exposure to truck competition. Following a multiyear regulatory review and STB approval in March 2023, CP Merged with Kansas City Southern on April 14 2023. The deal essentially creates a new single-line railway connecting Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, and we expect the firm to secure meaninful revenue synergies in the years ahead. ","In our view, each of the North American Class I railroads we cover, including Canadian Pacific Kansas City, enjoys a wide economic moat rooted in cost advantages and efficient scale. Core pricing and margin resilience in past freight recessions and in the face of substantial coal volume losses over the past decade-plus are a testament to the rails robust competitive positioning. With near certainty, we expect the rails to continue to leverage their two core moat sources into economic profit for the next 10 years and more likely than not 20 years from now. Cost advantage is a key driver of CP's wide economic moat. While barges, ocean liners, aircraft, and trucks also haul freight, railroads are by far the low-cost option where no waterway connects the origin and destination, especially for freight with low value-per-unit weight (bulk commodities). Along those lines, railroads enjoy roughly quadruple the fuel efficiency of trucking (per ton-mile of freight), and through greater railcar capacity and train length, rails make more effective use of locomotive assets and manpower despite the need for train yard personnel. Rails can also carry significantly more freight at once. Even for freight that can be shipped by truck, we estimate railroads enjoy a 10%-30% discount on a similar lane (on average). Even for intermodal container freight, which is largely made up of consumer-related products, rail has historically been cheaper than its key competitor truckload shipping on average over the cycle thanks to the rails aforementioned fuel efficiency and more economical use of labor. Furthermore, route density plays a role in rails cost advantage relative to a would-be new railroad entrant in a given corridor. We dont expect any new mainlines to be built in the future, but the incumbent Class I providers would enjoy vastly lower unit and marginal costs than an upstart given immense network/lane densitythe existing seven North American Class I railroads have thousands of customers across myriad end markets and geographies that drive significant freight volumes across their networks.In addition to cost advantage, CP and its peers benefit from efficient scale. Would-be rational competitors have little incentive to enter because massive up-front infrastructure costs and the potential for creating excess capacity amid limited demand would preclude economic profit and destroy value. The network of track and assets that the North American Class I railroads have in place is essentially impossible to replicate. CP's network spans Canada from east to west, and following the April 2023 KCS merger, it now operates seamless single-linehaul services from Canada and the upper Midwest down through Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and into Mexico. Railroads occasionally build new spurs and restore abandoned lines, but we anticipate no new mainlines will be built, given massive entry barriers.Efficient scale followed industry consolidation escalated by the 1980 Staggers Act, which permitted extensive rail line sales, abandonment, and combination while allowing for private contracts and rate setting based on market demand. In 1980, more than 40 Class I rails operated across North America, and today there are only seven; by definition, a Class I rail generates at least $475 million of revenue. Consequently, on all but the busiest lanes, a single railroad often serves an end-of-the-line shipper, only two railroads operate in most regions, and the rails have been able to reinvest while becoming quite profitable. In fact, we suspect that absent government intervention, the rational number of competitors on the continent would be two, via additional consolidation. This is because in most regions customers already have only two capable providers that service the market effectively and efficiently.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Canadian Pacific Kansas City is Medium. CP is exposed to the North American economy, and intermodal demand is influenced by goods consumption and retailer restocking. Currently, downside risk to demand is elevated due to soft industrial production and muted retailer restocking. Also, CP's merger with Kansas City Southern carries integration risk and the threat of overpayment should expected EBITDA synergies fall short (estimated at more than USD 1 billion within three years of consolidation). In terms of ESG risks, because CP carries freight for chemical and energy end-market shippers, it is subject to the liabilities associated with hazardous material spills, as Nortfolk Southern recently experienced. Furthermore, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board oversees railroads pricing, thus there will always be underlying risk of reregulation for CP's U.S. operations. That said, although there have been various discussions of unfavorable reform over the years (including the STB's focus on implementing some form of forced switching), material reregulation isnt a foregone conclusion. The STBs long-standing market-based approach has provided a balanced regulatory framework yielding a relatively small number of annual rate cases and reasonable outcomes that are often settled.CP's concessions (rather than owned assets) in Mexico subject the firm to risks of exchange rates (more so than its peers), inflation, and expropriation. Political and regulatory risk will remain a factor for Kansas City Southern de Mexico. That said, it has operated in Mexico via concession efficiently and largely without government intervention for more than a decade.Intensifying environmental regulations put CP's utility coal shipments at risk of disappearing over the long run. However, if coal must be hauled, rail is the fuel-efficient lower-emission option compared with trucking. We note that diesel price shocks are largely mitigated via fuel surcharges.","We award Canadian Pacific Kansas City a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our assessment that the company's balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing is reasonable, and supports its healthy competitive positioning. We think shareholder distributions are appropriate.Following a successful proxy fight by hedge fund Pershing Square Capital, Canadian Pacific appointed precision railroading pioneer Hunter Harrison as president and CEO in June 2012. This move launched CP's impressive turnaround. Installing former Canadian National CEO Harrison to lead was a primary objective in Pershing Square's push for new leadership. Harrison was a key driver of CN's industry leading margin profile, and his work at CP followed suit as he sparked dramatic operational improvementCP's adjusted operating ratio (expenses/revenue) averaged 79% between 2008 and 2012, but progressed to around 61% when Harrison departed in 2017. In early 2013, CP brought on board former CN COO Keith Creel as its own COO, and upon Harrison's departure to CSX in early 2017, Creel took the reins as CEO. This was a prudent choice, in our view. Who better to continue Harrison's operating plan than the COO he groomed for the role at another railroad? Creel is a veteran railroader who began as an operating management trainee at BNSF in 1992. Creel's performance at CP has proved solid, as the rail's operating ratio (lower is better) caught up with CN in 2018 and improved to an industry-leading 57.1% by 2020. The firm appointed Nadeem Velani as CFO in October 2016, following the surprisingly short tenure of two prior CFOs. Velani was in Harrison's inner circle for years and is thus well versed in PSR, which has been at the core of CP's margin progress over the past decade.CP paid a meaningful premium to acquire Kansas City Southern, which adds risk to our capital allocation assessment and DCF-derived fair value estimate if synergies don't pan out as expected. That said, CP is an incredibly well-run railroad with a highly talented leadership team and an excellent track record in terms of efficiency improvement over the past decade, thus we consider deal risk to be relatively modest. We also agree that the merger makes sense from a strategic perspective and believe the combined railroads will forge meaningful opportunities on the revenue front, thanks to adding new seamless single-line services. ","Canadian Pacific Kansas City is a Class-1 railroad operating on track that spans across most of Canada and into parts of the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. Following the April 2023 Kansas City Southern merger, CP operates new single-line-haul services from Canada and the Upper Midwest down through Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and into Mexico. It also hauls cross border and intra Mexico freight via operating concessions on 3,300 miles of rail in Mexico. CP hauls shipments of grain, intermodal containers, energy products (like crude and frac sand), chemicals, plastics, coal, fertilizer and potash, automotive products, and a diverse mix of other merchandise.","At year-end 2022, and following the December 2021 acquisition of Kansas City Southern into a voting trust, CP had roughly CAD 20 billion of total debt on the balance sheet. Assuming regulatory approval, once CP consolidates KSU, the combined company will probably have around $24 billion of total debt. Management expects pro forma combined leverage to approach 4 times EBITDA. That said, once KCS is integrated and synergies take hold, the firm expects leverage to normalize back down to about 2.5 times within two years. Given both rails' solid track record of execution and free cash generation, we are comfortable assuming the debt load moderates over the medium term. Due to the KCS transaction and related heavy debt load, management suspended its share repurchases, which we consider prudent. Management expects to maintain CP's dividend and avoid share repurchases until debt is reduced to 2.5 times EBITDA.

24/11/2023,Seven Focuses on Costs as TV Revenue Continues to Fall,Seven West Media Ltd,SWM,5,09/11/2023,Brian Han,0.25,AUD,24/11/2023,0.55,High,,Poor,,09/11/2023,"Advertising conditions in TV remain subdued, with September-quarter 2023 total market revenue down 8% year on year. Broadcast video on demand, or BVOD, revenue was up around 13%. But it was not enough to offset the 12% fall in metropolitan free-to-air advertising market, with regional likely not much better. Faced with this top-line headwind, TV operators are zeroing in on expenses. Nine Entertainment's fiscal 2023 TV EBITDA margin was 24.6%, higher than Seven West Media's TV EBITDA margin of 20.1%. Their total TV revenue was about the same, at AUD 1.1 billion. It means Seven was effectively carrying around AUD 60 million in excess TV costs. Guess how much Seven's latest cost-out program is? AUD 60 million. It is as if Seven management needed a hard target to justify another cost reduction, and chose Nine's TV cost base as the goal to strive for. Theoretically, Seven's TV margin should be even higher than Nine's, given its BVOD margin is 78% (versus Nine's 60%) and it generates AUD 40 million in earnings a year from program sales which is an almost 100% margin. In practice, Seven has historically been a high-cost TV operator with an almost unhealthy obsession for total people ratings supremacy. As such, if the AUD 60 million cost-out initiative compromises its TV revenue or revenue share in any way, it is likely to be curtailed. This is why our long-term TV EBITDA margin forecast for Seven remains at 18.5%. Even then, we see no-moat-rated Seven shares as undervalued, trading at a 50% discount to our AUD 0.55 per share fair value estimate. We project five-year EBITDA CAGR of minus 2% but the market appears to be taking a much more fatalistic view on Seven's long-term maintainable earnings. No-moat-rated Nine shares are also undervalued, trading at a 30% discount to our AUD 2.80 per share fair value estimate. We believe investors are underappreciating Nine's asset diversity and quality beyond TV which is less than 50% of group earnings before corporate costs.","Seven West Media commands a strong position in the Australian free-to-air television industry, with leading ratings and revenue shares. The unique antisiphoning regime in Australia ensures that Seven Network will continue to have a stronghold on marquee live sports programming, such as the Australian Football League, cricket, and other sports events of national importance.","The free-to-air television industry is a structurally challenged one, with proliferating entertainment choices for consumers. Consequently, viewers are declining and advertisers will increasingly follow eyeballs elsewhere. The company's margin could decline more than expected as costs for marquee content continue to escalate.",09/11/2023,"Seven West Media, which generates the majority of its earnings through Seven Network's free-to-air TV and broadcast video on demand units, offers exposure to the AUD 3.6 billion total Australian linear and digital television advertising market. Free-to-air TV is a media segment that is gradually declining. This has been caused by growing digital media alternatives, rapidly changing entertainment consumption habits, and increasing high-speed broadband adoption.  Within this mature industry, Seven Network commands the number-one or two position, with a 38%-40% rating and revenue share of the commercial metropolitan free-to-air television market. Its library of extensive sports and general entertainment programming has aided in the rise of these share metrics in recent years. In our view, Seven Network can maintain revenue shares at the 38% level on a long-term, midcycle basis.  The key investment consideration comes down to Seven Network's EBIT margin outlook. This is important in the face of increasing competition for viewers (from proliferating new digital entertainment options) and for content (from digital upstarts and incumbent television broadcasters).  On the other hand, the broadcast on demand, or BVOD, digital unit is benefitting from viewers' increasing consumption of TV via digital means. Seven is well-placed to ride this structural wave, given its vast streaming rights to marquee content. The group's exposure to the structurally challenged print media industry is another key issue facing investors in Seven West Media. Earnings from the newspaper division have slumped from almost AUD 140 million in fiscal 2011 to AUD 30 million in fiscal 2022. However, combined profits from the print media business now account for less than 10% of the group's total.","We do not believe Seven West Media has an economic moat. Seven Network (including studios and digital), representing almost 90% of the group's earnings, operates in the structurally challenged free-to-air TV industry. While it is one of only three players licensed to do so in the Australian metropolitan markets, the intangible power of this license has declined to such an extent that its value has been written down considerably and it no longer acts as a barrier for competition. Proliferation of alternative digital delivery channels (smartphones, broadband, personal devices) and new forms of entertainment (video streaming, short-form content, social media) are fragmenting television audiences, cutting down switching costs. While the networks trump their declining viewers as still the biggest mass audience for advertisers in a splintering world, that argument will continue to lose force, in a world where younger people shun linear programming dictated by telecasters. Certainly, advertisers are aware of the declining effectiveness of free-to-air advertising, with Australian television steadily losing advertising share to digital media. Newspapers account for less than 10% of the group's earnings base. As with most print media assets in developed countries, these assets are coming under severe structural pressures, with profits slumping from almost AUD 140 million in fiscal 2011 to AUD 33 million in fiscal 2022. With the proliferation of user-friendly digital media and ubiquity of means to access the internet, readers are increasingly migrating away from newspapers, and advertising dollars are following suit.Finally, Seven's digital assets, including broadcast video on demand, or BVOD, compete against a plethora of behemoth and niche digital properties for the attention of web-surfing consumers. Unlike the popular social media and search/display giants, the business lacks scale and enjoys no network effect.","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High to Seven West Media.Balance sheet repair in recent years has eliminated our prior concern regarding the group's financial position. Its current net debt/EBITDA is just 0.9 times.Beyond the impact of the coronavirus, digitization and changing ways of distributing media content are giving rise to proliferating choices, splintering the consumption patterns of viewers. Consequently, free-to-air television's traditional strength of aggregating mass audience is waning, forcing advertisers to follow eyeballs elsewhere. While the networks tout their declining viewers as still the biggest mass audience available in a fragmenting world, such an argument is unlikely to hold longer term. Worse still, costs of marquee content are escalating. This is due to increasing competition, not just from fellow competitors in the free-to-air industry keen to minimize the pace of viewer migration, but also from new media distribution channels hell-bent on signing up new subscribers. The television advertising industry is a cyclical one, where revenue could swing wildly depending on economic conditions. As a largely fixed-cost business, the earnings leverage from this cyclical top line can be significant, both on the upside and the downside.In terms of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, Seven's disclosure in general is substandard and raises concerns about transparency and accountability to minority shareholders. It has some initiatives to manage risks related to material ESG issues but the policies are not clear. Nevertheless, the company has not been implicated in any significant ESG-related controversies, and we view the probability of significant and prolonged breaches in key ESG areas as less than 25%.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Seven West Media is Poor.The balance sheet is solid. The financial position has been restored since the dark days of 2020 when the COVID-19 impact was at its most severe. Currently, net debt/EBITDA is 0.9 times.On the investment side, we rate Seven as fair. The company is 41% owned by executive chairman Kerry Stokes via Seven Group Holdings. While Stokes is an astute executive and one of the most respected business people in Australia, Seven West Media's capital-allocation track record has been mixed.On shareholder distributions, we rate Seven as appropriate. There are unlikely to be any dividend distributions to shareholders in the foreseeable future. We see this as prudent given the recently repaired balance sheet, compounded by the uncertain earnings outlook due to the current precarious economic environment. However, the group activated an on-market buyback program in August 2022 for up to 10% of issued capital.","Seven West Media operates Seven Network, a free-to-air television network spread across five capital cities, as well as many regional markets via Prime. It also owns most of the newspapers circulating in Western Australia (including the monopoly Perth, West Australian Newspapers).

24/11/2023,Corporate Travel's Recovery Holdings Up Despite Economic Uncertainties,Corporate Travel Management Ltd,CTD,4,,Brian Han,18.92,AUD,24/11/2023,22.5,High,,Standard,,,No Text Available,"Corporate Travel permanently lowered its cost base during COVID-19, increasing its upside leverage as travel activities recover.  In an increasingly complex post-pandemic travel environment, value of a travel agent for corporate travel clients may increase given the heightened rules, restrictions and regulations across different locations and countries. As a minnow in the highly fragmented USD 1.5 trillion global market, there is significant growth upside for Corporate Travel to lift its market share position from its fourth position in 2021.","Travel conditions are likely to remain volatile due to lingering COVID-19 impact and a slowing economy. Corporate travel activities could be permanently lower in a post COVID-19 world as businesses opt for greater video conferencing over face-to-face interactions. Corporate travel is a highly cyclical business and is susceptible to many externalities, while competition is always fierce and Corporate Travels acquisition-driven growth strategy comes with execution and integration risks.",20/11/2023,"A firm uses external travel management services when its own travel activities become too complex and time-consuming to organize, co-ordinate and track, not to mention the compliance and governance issues that must be managed. COVID-19 has also thrown up a myriad of regulatory and safety measures across different regions that can also affect a corporate travel itinerary. A corporate travel management group can handle all these activities. In the current postpandemic environment, it can also incorporate regulatory health and safety information into its technology platform with the aim of increasing traveler and business confidence. All this allows a corporate client to focus on its core business, while benefiting from travel cost savings via a travel management companys scale, geographical spread and technological capability. Corporate Travel Management is one such company. Its key objective is to grow its share in the mammoth USD 1.5 trillion global corporate travel management market. The groups pro forma, pre-COVID-19 total transaction volumes, or TTV, of AUD 12 billion represents a minuscule share of the total market. Since the groups founding in 1994, acquisitions have been managements primary way to grow market share. They quickly provide scale that leads to better deals with travel suppliers and improve credibility to pitch for more tenders, creating a virtuous circle to lift market share. The group is now the fifth-largest player in the global corporate travel management space. Management has augmented its acquisitions by executing a three-pillar strategy that focuses on service, technology, and return on investment for its clients. Staff are incentivized on the quality of the service they provide to the corporate clients, rather than sales like most of its competitors, resulting in high customer retention (around 97% historically). In 2015 and 2016, Corporate Travel Management built its own booking system called Lightning which is customized to each region the group operates in. Armed with these attributes, the group aims to improve corporates return on investment from using Corporate Travels integrated travel management offerings.","We do not view Corporate Travel Management as having an economic moat. It is an intermediary between travel providers (for example, airlines, hotels, car rentals) and business travelers (for example, large enterprises, small and medium firms, governments), using a technology platform consisting of direct supply arrangements with specific travel providers, a global distribution system and a suite of customer booking tools. In all these areas, we believe there are factors to constrain Corporate Travel Management from generating excess returns.On the travel provider side, they own and control the supply of inventory that Corporate Travel Management on-sells. These travel providers are themselves consolidating. As such, they are becoming larger and more powerful, with advancing technology and the internet further enhancing their ability to develop a direct relationship with the end travelers (for example, better virtual service, more seamless integration with traveler schedule/booking/governance systems, greater provision of destination-specific information such as health or regulatory requirements).On the business traveler side, larger employers are well-resourced to organize their own travel activities, and/or can drive a hard bargain with travel management companies on the fees they charge for their intermediary services. Granted, Corporate Travel Management mainly targets small and medium-size businesses who lack the resources to organize their own travels. However, all other players are also vying for this market, with competitive implications longer term.On the technology platform side, the providers of global distribution systems, or GDS, (for example, Sabre and Amadeus IT, both narrow moat-rated) are tightly integrated into the travel management ecosystem, and are a critical source of wide-scale inventory supply for travel intermediaries such as Corporate Travel. The fees that these global distribution system providers pay travel management companies to use their systems are unlikely to grow materially. This is because, in the long run, these GDS operators with direct contact with the whole spectrum of suppliers could be in a better competitive position. They are the ones aggregating supply and building genuine scale. Given the likely reliance of Corporate Travel on these GDS operators, its competitive position may suffer.Some travel management companies develop their own booking systems at the front end, as a differentiator to lure corporate customers. For example, Corporate Travel Management built its own booking system called Lightning in 2015 and 2016, customized to each region. But such a practice is becoming common among larger players, so that proprietary booking systems are unlikely to be a maintainable source of competitive advantage for a travel management company longer term.The likely pressures from all these sides are a key reason why the corporate travel agency industry has been consolidating. Greater size and scale improve the players bargaining position, lead to better deals with travel suppliers and improve credibility to pitch for more tenders and create a virtuous circle to further lift market share.Despite the consolidation, the top five players in the market (Amex GBT/Egencia, BCD, CWT, Corporate Travel Management, Flight Centre) have a combined share of just under 10% of the USD 1.5 trillion global corporate travel spending market (as estimated by the Global Business Travel Association in 2019 before COVID-19). Consequently, as the fourth-largest operator in the space with a significant acquisition appetite, Corporate Travel Management could continue to generate good profitability. This is especially given its capital-light business model, where over 70% of operating costs are people-related and capital expenditures are mainly technology-related.However, we are not confident that such profitability can be maintained beyond the next decade. This is due to the industry structure concerns discussed above and doubts whether Corporate Travel has any competitive differentiations relative to peers that can be maintained over the next decade. Future acquisitions could also become more expensive, as scale-building becomes the main game for all operators, and Corporate Travel Management has made it clear that equity capital will be primary funding source for large acquisitions. The longer-term uncertainty on profitability is further heightened by the COVID-19-induced working-from-home phenomenon, one that could permanently lower business travel activities, putting further pressure on corporate travel agency business model.The groups historical 97% retention rate demonstrates there is a degree of switching costs that discourage clients from leaving Corporate Travel. The group attempts to maintain that switching costs by executing a three-pillar strategy that focuses on service, technology and return on investment for its clients. Staff are incentivized on the quality of the service they provide to the corporate clients, rather than sales like most of its competitors. In 2015 and 2016, Corporate Travel Management built its own booking system at the front end called Lightning which is customized to each region the group operates in. Armed with these attributes, the group has a demonstrable track record of improving its clients return on investment from using Corporate Travels integrated travel management offerings. However, we believe all other competitors in this space are investing to do the same, and any differentiation that Corporate Travel currently enjoy will dissipate longer term. Furthermore, all major players in the corporate travel management space enjoy similar 95%-plus retention rates. This suggests that corporate customers generally stay with their existing travel management service providers until issues arise or a competing firm offers a more attractive arrangement (that is, lower price, better service, wider inventory).","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High to Corporate Travel Management.Travel activities in general are susceptible to external conditions such as geopolitical disruption, war or terrorism, economic downturns, natural disasters or other adverse health-related developments. The industry is also highly competitive and fragmented, with all players constantly raising the bar in terms of technological improvements and analytics-based sales and retention techniques. They also often deal with big corporate customers with huge bargaining power. Finally, the strong uptake of remote working aided by technologies such a video conferencing may dampen long term corporate travel demand relative to pre-COVID-19 projections. In terms of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, Corporate Travel Management arranges travel services provided by suppliers to corporate consumers. Booking travel services that do not meet customer expectations could trigger reputational damage. In addition, Corporate Travel relies on employees to sell travel services, manage bookings and handle complaints. Poor working conditions or discrimination issues could impact employee motivation, potentially affecting bookings. Moreover, the group receives, stores and processes large volumes of sensitive customer data. This triggers exposure to data privacy and security breaches, which may result in regulatory action or loss of customer trust. We view the probability of significant and persistent breaches in these areas as less than 25%, given the firm's long history of satisfactory performance. Corporate Travel came under scrutiny after an attack by a short-seller group VGI in 2018 and 2020 questioning the groups accounting practices and underlying growth trends. We view these claims as either unfounded and/or accounted for in our intrinsic assessment.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Corporate Travel Management is Standard.The balance sheet is strong. The group has a conservative attitude toward debt and almost always carries a net cash position. We believe the company has sufficient liquidity to see it through the current COVID-induced and economy-related uncertainties on business travel. The group also commenced an AUD 100 million share buyback in November 2023.On the investment side, we rate Corporate Travel as fair. The group's solid long-term growth has been overseen by founder and managing director Jamie Pherous. From a humble beginning in 1994, he has built the group to become one of the largest corporate travel management services companies globally, mainly via acquisitions and a service-centric ethos. Over 26 acquisitions have been executed since Corporate Travel Managements founding, culminating in the October 2020 purchase of Travel and Transport in North America, catapulting the group to be the fourth largest player in the global corporate travel management space. Funding of bigger acquisitions has been through issuance share issues, rather than debt. The acquisition strategy has masked underlying organic growth which has been difficult to decipher, particularly given the highly competitive and cyclical nature of the industry. However, integration track record has been good and client retention rate has consistently been around the 97% mark.On shareholder distributions, we rate Corporate Travel as appropriate. Given the current COVID-induced uncertainties on business travel activities, the priority is to conserve balance sheet. But dividends were reinstated in the second half of fiscal 2022, and will be on a conservative payout of around 50% in the future, compared with a historical average of around 55%.","Corporate Travel Management provides travel services for business and government clients across the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and Asia. The company has built scale and breadth through both organic growth and acquisitions. As of 2022, Corporate Travel is the worlds fourth-largest corporate travel management company based with pro forma, pre-COVID-19 total transaction volumes of AUD 11 billion, but it remains a relative minnow in the highly fragmented USD 1.5 trillion global market. The group offers expertise and personalized service to corporate clients spanning various industries such as government, healthcare, mining, energy, infrastructure, and construction. Before the pandemic, more than 60% of the groups client travel was domestic (within country) in nature. ","Corporate Travel Management is in sound financial health. As at the end of June 2023, the group had no debt and AUD 139 million in cash, excluding client cash. The group raised AUD 375 million in equity capital in September/October of 2020, to fund the AUD 275 million acquisition of North America-based Transport and Travel, and to strengthen the balance sheet. There is also an unused AUD 100 million committed debt facility that expires in July 2025. We believe this is ample liquidity for Corporate Travel to see through the current COVID-19-induced and general economic uncertainties on business travel. It also has enough capacity to pursue acquisition opportunities as they arise, albeit larger purchases are likely to involve equity capital raisings due the boards historically conservative stance on debt. The conservatism is such that the group commenced an AUD 100 million share buyback in November 2023.",CTD.AX,Consumer Cyclical,2740685824.0,ASX,529517.0,AUD,18.989999771118164,True,1,17.697007683499997,18.565818205117075,0
25/11/2023,Interpublic Group Posts Strong Q4 Results but Cautious About 2023 Growth; Shares Fairly Valued,The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc,IPG,4,20/10/2023,Ali Mogharabi,30.62,USD,24/11/2023,36.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,20/10/2023,"IPG again missed expectations during the third quarter and lowered its growth guidance for the year, lagging its major rivals. Publicis and Omnicom posted solid organic growth, while Publicis increased its full-year net revenue outlook. IPGs net revenue declined organically from last year, as the firms tech and telecom clients have been cutting spending. The firms exposure to those industries is greater than those of Publicis and Omnicom but less than WPP. IPG also lacks seamless integration of its creative offerings with media and data and has had to improve its media buying, which requires some changes to its trading model, both contributing to its weak quarter.  We expect these issues to be resolved by the end of the year or in 2024. In our view, tech and telecom ad spending should improve into 2024, benefiting the entire advertising industry. We also think that IPG must more aggressively combine its creativity with digital and data analytics, which include artificial intelligence capabilities, like WPPs latest move with VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson. There were some indications from management that the firm is moving in this direction. Finally, it appears that the firms model adjustments in media buying may have resolved given its recent sizable General Mills account win. While we have slightly reduced our projections, we are maintaining our $36 fair value estimate on IPG. After trading in 3-star territory for most of this year, IPG shares have become attractive again. We expect the firm will return to organic growth over the next year after what appears will be a full-year net revenue decline in 2023. Total net revenue of $2.3 billion was up 0.6% year over year as an organic decline of 0.4% was offset by 0.3% and 0.7% benefits from acquisitions and currency exchange movements, respectively.","Although the environment is evolving, there will always be a market for creating and delivering advertising to consumers around the globe. IPG's operational performance has benefited from having financial professionals at the helm, instead of people from the creative side of the business. IPG owns some of the most acclaimed agencies in the business, such as FCB and McCann.","Because most of its profits come from mature markets like the U.S. and Europe, IPG's organic revenue growth could lag some of its peers. Marketers are increasingly asking for better results from their agencies while heavily scrutinizing the fees that they're paying. This trend will only continue as alternative marketing channels gain adoption with users. New forms of advertising continue to emerge and evolve. Any misstep by IPG could allow its peers to gain share at its expense.",09/02/2023,"Interpublic Group is one of the global Big Five advertising holding companies along with Dentsu, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP. The firm has maintained its market position following the COVID-19 pandemic as it continues to make acquisitions and increases its focus on faster-growing emerging markets and the overall digital ad market. The firm has demonstrated consistent operating margin expansion through cost controls during the past five years, which we expect to continue through the next few years. IPG has transitioned from traditional advertising into a complete solutions provider with digital and other services, such as public relations and consulting. The firm further diversified its revenue in 2018 as it acquired data solutions provider Acxiom. We look for IPG to continue its acquisition growth strategy to gain further traction in other faster-growing international markets. Globalization of businesses in various verticals has increased demand not only for vertical-specific advertising expertise, but also for experience, knowledge, and a clearer understanding of different cultures and regulations. We expect IPG to continue making acquisitions and investing to capture growth in the digital advertising market. Clients of IPG and its peers are allocating more ad dollars toward more targeted digital campaigns, creating growth opportunities for agencies like IPGs MRM/McCann and Matterkind. IPG has made headway in providing different components of digital advertising such as programmatic media buying and ad placement, along with data analytics and performance-measurement services. ","We view IPG as a narrow-moat company. IPG holds valuable intangible assets, in our view, around the holding companys brand equity and the strong reputations of its various advertising agencies around the world. We also think its continuing investments in consumer data accumulation and analysis give the company a maintainable competitive advantage. We believe the utilization of its moat source and overall execution will result in IPG earning excess returns on capital for at least the next 10 years.IPG is the worlds fourth-largest ad holding company, based on annual revenue. Through various acquisitions, the firm has transitioned from traditional advertising, which includes print, broadcast and cable television, billboards, and mail, into a complete solutions provider by combining traditional with digital (including mobile, online video, social media, and data analytics), along with other services such as public relations. IPG provides its services worldwide, with over 75% of its revenue coming from more developed regions such as the U.S. and Europe.Advertising firms provide various services to help businesses market their products and brands more effectively. The services include the design and creation of advertising content, in addition to its distribution and placement through various channels. Ad firms also manage the campaigns that they help their clients launch. This includes not only working with various mediums to purchase media and place the ads, but also tracking the effectiveness of the ads by gathering data and measuring the return on investment.Consolidation in the fragmented advertising industry has resulted in five companies generating nearly 30% of the worlds total ad revenue. In our view, three factors drove this space toward consolidation: globalization, the emergence and growth of digital media, and more cost-control initiatives taken by clients.Globalization of businesses in various verticals has increased demand not only for vertical-specific advertising expertise, but also for experience and clearer understanding of different cultures and regulations within the geographic regions in which businesses want to market and sell their products. For this reason, IPG and the other largest ad holding companies have consistently acquired smaller local ad agencies and quickly gained traction in other international markets.This consolidation can also be viewed as somewhat of a hedge against revenue volatility, as IPGs revenue is driven mainly by macroeconomic factors, such as overall GDP growth, consumer confidence, and growth in disposable income, which influence businesses decisions regarding the size of their ad and marketing budgets. The status of these factors varies at different times in different regions. While North America and Europe remain the most attractive markets for ad agencies and are usually highly correlated from a macroeconomic standpoint, other regions--such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa--grow at slightly faster rates when in the growth stage. In addition, they are not as highly correlated in terms of when the peaks and troughs of their economic cycles take place. While revenue from those regions accounts for only around 23% of IPGs total revenue, the company's presence in those areas can be viewed as a hedge against revenue volatility.The emergence and growth of digital media, which has brought a more targeted marketing and advertising platform, has also driven increased consolidation in the ad space, as IPG and its peers have acquired various smaller agencies that focused on the growing digital advertising niche. As most of the ad holding companies larger clients and Fortune 500 firms favor omnichannel or multichannel marketing and advertising campaigns, these acquisitions help make the ad holding companies platform-agnostic and one-stop shops, unlike the smaller competitors.Larger clients cost-reduction steps have forced the Big Five to further consolidate to create cost efficiencies. While most Fortune 500 companies continue to demand creative and effective ad campaigns, they would also like to simplify the process of campaign design and launch by reducing the number of agencies with which they work for various components of their campaigns, which may include not only ad creation and media buying but also public relations. As a result, continuing consolidation has helped the Big Five provide a complete advertising solution to various clients around the world and benefit from growing digital ad platforms such as social media, mobile, and video.While significant consolidation has taken place, IPG will continue to operate as a holding company, allowing the acquired agencies to maintain their reputations under their own brands. In addition, its reputation and brand allow it to compete mainly with the rest of the Big Five for the largest accounts. When seeking ad agencies to create and manage large campaigns, the Fortune 500 companies allow only a few ad companies to pitch their ideas. This is where the reputation and brands of the Big Five come into play, as the known associated agencies are typically asked to pitch and compete for the account or a specific campaign. In our view, this recognition, which can be interpreted as stemming from high brand value, is shared by the Big Five. IPG and the rest of the Big Five also benefit from intangible assets in the form of consumer data, which they accumulate by managing and tracking the performance of their various campaigns. We believe this data, along with data provided by third parties, helps the firm analyze the return on investment of campaigns very quickly, which ad agency clients tend to demand more as they launch more below-the-line campaigns. Further, access to this data may help IPG adjust and improve campaigns, whether on the creativity or media-buying side, to increase ROI for clients and further enhance the value of its brand. ","Like its peers, IPG faces macroeconomic risks associated with slower growth or a downturn in the global economy. While IPG has gained some traction in emerging regions, more than 75% of its revenue is from developed regions such as the U.S. and continental Europe. For this reason, any downturn in those regions will hurt IPGs top and bottom lines, like what took place in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, economic growth in those regions is less variable than in emerging markets. We ran a regression of the U.S. real GDP growth (or decline) against changes in advertising spending beginning in 2000, resulting in adjusted R-squared of 62%, or the assumption that nearly two thirds of changes in advertising spending can be explained by changes in the GDP. Data from the same period also indicates that during real economic growth (except for 2001 due to the impact of attacks on 9/11, and 2008 during which the Great Recession began and the GDP increased by only 0.12%), growth in ad spending on average is around 1.4 times growth in the economy. During full-year economic decline (in 2009 and 2020), spending on advertising declined 3.3 times more than decline in the economy. Economic growth in developed regions is less variable than in emerging markets.The firm also faces risks during continuing periods of global economic growth. These include the possibility of paying too much of a premium to purchase ad agencies and increasing competition on the digital ad and data science fronts, which will probably also be present during economic downturns. In addition, possible changes in social norms and acceptance could increase ESG risk, as the changes may significantly increase negative client reactions, affecting IPG's revenue and overall business. For these reasons, weve given the firm a high uncertainty rating.","We assess the capital allocation of IPG as Exemplary. IPG continues to allocate capital to drive growth and market leadership via acquisitions and further reward shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The firm spent $2.3 billion in 2018 for data solutions provider Acxiom. Historically, net agency acquisitions (excluding the Acxiom deal), which had averaged between $30 million and $50 million, have contributed slightly below 1% to top-line growth. However, since 2019, IPG has been more active in the disposition of underperforming agencies. IPG has also allocated nearly $120 million per year to share buybacks during the last three years. This was lower than the $360 million per year buybacks during 2011-15 mainly because of the large acquisition of Acxiom. In 2022, the firm accelerated its share buyback and repurchased shares worth over $320 million. The firm has rewarded its shareholders with a 69.5 average dividend payout ratio (including 114% during the pandemic in 2020) while increasing dividends per share by an average of 7% per year for the past three years. While the COVID-19 pandemic forced IPG to curb its share buybacks, we continue to commend management for such capital allocation as IPG has not only continued to make proper investments to remain one of the major ad holding firms, it has also returned a large share of its income and cash flow to shareholders. At the end of 2022, IPG had net debt of $395 million, with debt/EBITDA and interest coverage averaging 2.35 and 7.2, respectively, during the past three years. While the firm increased its total debt by 75% during the past five years due to the $2.3 billion acquisition of Acxiom, we are assuming it will pay off notes due in 2024, improving those ratios to average around 1.48 and 15.3 during the next five years.IPG has continued to expand margins and generate excess ROIC, and the stock has outperformed its peers like Omnicom over the last 20 years. However, it has beaten the communications sector returns only 50% of the time and has underperformed with respect to the overall U.S. equity market, which could be due to the market applauding the purchase of Acxiom and aggressive investments in data analytics and digital and the markets overall assumption about ad holding firms losing ground to consulting companies that have more technology offerings. The network of the agencies that operate under the IPG umbrella is led by various agency-level management teams. IPG was led by Michael Roth until January 2021, when he stepped aside and took the executive chairman role. Roth had been CEO since 2005, when he replaced David Bell. Roth successfully led IPG through an arduous turnaround. He was replaced by Philippe Krakowsky, a 19-year IPG veteran and former chief operating officer. Krakowsky also has led IPGs digital strategy for some time as he managed agencies such as R/GA and was behind the acquisition of Acxiom. Ellen Johnson replaced Frank Mergenthaler as CFO in 2020 after the latter's retirement. Johnson was previously IPGs treasurer and senior vice president of finance.",Interpublic Group is among the worlds largest advertising holding companies based on annual revenue. It provides traditional advertising services along with digital and other services such as public relations through various acquisitions. IPG has made these services available in over 100 countries. The company generates more than 80% of its revenue from developed regions such as the United States and Europe.,"IPG has net debt of $395 million, with debt/EBITDA and interest coverage averaging 2.35 and 7.2, respectively, during the past three years. While the firm increased its total debt by 75% during the past five years due to the $2.3 billion acquisition of Acxiom, we assume it will pay off notes due in 2024, and we believe the aforementioned ratios will average around 1.5 and 15.3 during the next five years. We expect IPG to continue to generate free cash flow to be used for acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks. Total cash allocated toward acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks in the past two years has exceeded the free cash flow generated during that time, mainly due to the significant increase in share repurchases in 2022, which we expect to decline in 2023 and beyond. The firms dividend payout as a percentage of net income has averaged 69.5% during the last three years, which included a very high payout ratio during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",IPG,Communication Services,11991855104.0,NYQ,3515037.0,USD,30.6200008392334,True,1,29.874390770408237,31.92175874477439,1

The company has experienced pressure from cautious client spending patterns. This has created headwinds for the research models and services segment as biopharma customers have reprioritized pipelines and are conserving cash amid macroeconomic challenges. Despite these headwinds, some demand trends point to encouraging signs that the environment will stabilize. In the safety assessment business, Charles River experienced sequential improvement in both the study cancellation rate and the net book/bill ratio in the third quarter, which is supported by stabilization in the biotech funding environment. The third quarter was the second consecutive quarterly increase in biotech funding on a trailing 12-month basis, led by venture capital investments. We maintain our $260 fair value estimate and view the stock as undervalued, currently trading in 5-star territory and about 35% below our fair value estimate. We forecast nearly $4.1 billion in revenue for 2023, an increase of about 3% over 2022. We maintain our positive long-term outlook for Charles River based on steadily increasing demand for preclinical outsourcing services and the companys leading position in the industry. We reaffirm our narrow moat rating, which is based on intangible assets and switching costs associated with the company's animal research models and its preclinical discovery and safety assessment services. We think the stock is trading at an attractive entry point for long-term investors as the market underappreciates Charles Rivers leading position in research models and discovery and safety assessment. The stock price has also been punished for near-term macroeconomic challenges that should stabilize over our forecast period.",Charles Rivers reputation for quality and scientific expertise supports its leading position in the research model and preclinical trial markets. The companys contract research business should benefit from robust biotech demand and funding. The high-margin manufacturing support segment should boost earnings for the company as it grows.,"Charles River does not have a long-term advantage in drug discovery, as we believe that will remain the core competency of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The company is susceptible to declines in preclinical outsourcing in the biopharma industry, which can lead to excess capacity and weigh on earnings. The asset-heavy nature of the preclinical business weighs on ROICs and requires continued reinvestment.",12/05/2023,"Animal research models have been the foundation of Charles River's business since 1947, and the company has expanded to provide solutions encompassing research models and related services, drug discovery, preclinical testing, and manufacturing support. It services nearly all top and mid-tier biopharma players.  Charles River focuses on providing the most widely used animal research strains. It has built a reputation for quality and speed, which allows it to control 35% market share of the research model and services industry and 33% of the outsourced safety assessment industry worldwide. The complexities of breeding and transporting genetically modified models results in high barriers to entry and it can charge premium pricing. Charles River's reputation for quality and the nature of preclinical research encourages clients to stick with their model supplier. The company also bundles the models with additional services, including its diagnostics and consulting services and fully managed preclinical trials. It worked on more than 80% of all FDA-approved drugs between 2020 and 2022, which further demonstrates its expansive reach across the industry.  Drug discovery and safety assessment makes up about 60% of the company's revenue. With a strong reputation in the research model space, Charles River took advantage of its quality brand to pursue preclinical testing as the biopharma industry has increased the level of outsourced research. Aggressive expansion in capacity hurt the segment in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when revenue saw double-digit declines during the economic downturn. However, since 2008, we estimate that outsourcing has increased from 25% penetration to about 60%, so the biopharma industry is now more reliant on CROs for preclinical work, and Charles River leads with a top market share.  The manufacturing support segment has seen success with its unique rapid microbial testing technology. In the near term, we expect double-digit growth and healthy margins to continue with this premium-priced product as biologics grow in popularity as a drug class.","We award Charles River Laboratories a narrow moat based on the intangible assets and switching costs associated with its widely used animal research models. As the global leader in this space, Charles River breeds rodent research models with specific genetic characteristics for preclinical studies around the world. Preclinical testing is a regulation-required precursor to human trials, and Charles River's research model strains are widely known for their genetic integrity and quality. Charles River has utilized its trusted reputation for quality models and has also become deeply engrained in clients' preclinical research process, which involves its research model services and discovery & safety assessment solutions. The company worked on more than 85% of all FDA-approved drugs in 2021, which further demonstrates its expansive reach across the industry.Charles Rivers research model business has built a reputation for quality and speed, which allows it to control 35% market share of the research model & services industry and 33% of the outsourced safety assessment industry worldwide. Charles River can charge premium pricing for its high-quality animal models as well as bundle its reputable animal models with additional services, including its diagnostics and consulting services to fully managed preclinical trials for its clients. Breeding and delivering animal models are complex processes that require sophisticated scientific expertise in gene editing to create and maintain specific strains and animal characteristics. This complexity and expertise lead to significant barriers to entry. Charles River provides over 150 different strains, primarily focusing on rats and mice, which are the most widely used rodent models. Clients can also specify the sub-strain, animal characteristics, and additional procedures and modifications. Options include animal models with no immune system, models engineered for specific genetic disorders and diseases, models with device implants for real-time wireless health surveillance, models transplanted with human stem cells or human tumor cells, and many other specifications. About one of every two small animal models sold in Western markets comes from Charles River. The best models will have consistent and uniform genetic makeup, which requires generations of systematic inbreeding as well as regular backcrossing with the original genetic source to prevent genetic shifts over time. However, inbreeding poses challenges to survival and reproduction, and these challenges are exacerbated by the engineered diseases and immunodeficiencies. Additionally, transportation of immunodeficient animals requires pristine standards of care. In the early 2010s, several studies, including some backed by large pharma companies, showed an alarmingly low rate of reproducibility of published preclinical studies. Several factors, including inadequate standards of handling and reporting animal models, were associated with the low rate of reproducibility. As a result, there became a greater focus on avoiding bacterial contamination, maintaining genetic integrity, and careful documentation of animal characteristics. The FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations require a detailed disclosure of animal models, (including species, sex, age, weight, strain, sub-strain, and supplier of the animal) in every final report of a preclinical study. We believe FDAs GLP regulations help solidify Charles River's narrow moat for several reasons. The heightened focus on contamination and genetic integrity enforces high barriers to entry and emphasizes the value of a trusted brand. When clients select research models, they require accuracy and are willing to pay a premium price for these specifications. In addition, we believe that regulatory standards and the nature of preclinical research push clients to rely more heavily on Charles River's auxiliary services and full-service preclinical trials. If animals are bred outside a suppliers facilities, the animal's genes are more susceptible to mutations and genetic drift. Likewise, the longer an animal is away from Charles Rivers facilities, the more likely it is subject to various bacterial conditions, which would impact the results of the study. Clients also utilize Charles River's insourcing solutions, in which it manages the research operations of government entities, academic organizations, and commercial clients. These insourcing solutions include recruitment, training, staffing, and management services) both within its clients facilities or utilizing the Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab, which leases space to clients. Insourcing contracts are usually three to five years in length, and these embed Charles River in clients' core operations and reduce a client's likelihood to switch to a new supplier. The research model business has remained a steady recurring revenue stream for the company as a result of high switching costs. Once a client chooses to work with a specific animal model strain, it will continue using that model or a related variation for reproducibility purposes. It is noteworthy that even the same rodent strain from two different suppliers will have enough variation to compromise an experiment, so it's a common industry recommendation to stay with a supplier for all future orders to maintain the integrity of the studys results. Additionally, rodent models typically have short life spans in preclinical studies, which requires consistent replacement of the animals. Wild mice live about two years, but a typical research project may need to sacrifice dozens of animal models every few weeks. Researchers tend to focus on the same disease or even the same gene for their entire careers, which makes it less likely that clients would have an opportunity to shift model suppliers simply due to a new project. Similarly, biotechnology companies tend to conduct multiple projects within the same disease area or specialty, sometimes for decades.In addition to the insourcing services, Charles River has used the advantage of its trusted research models within its discovery & safety assessment segment, which includes drug discovery and preclinical trials. This segment comprises over 60% of the companys total revenue, and its growth has relied on the intangible assets and switching costs of the research models. Additionally, Charles River has a 33% market share of the outsourced safety assessment industry, with LabCorps Covance ranking second-largest with a 20% market share. As industry trends have moved more of the drug development cycle to CROs and outsourcing penetration has increased, many biopharma companies stopped purchasing research models directly from Charles River and instead now select Charles River's full preclinical services. We estimate outsourcing has increased from 25% in 2008 to about 60% in 2020, and we expect outsourcing penetration will continue to grow steadily.Lastly, the company offers solutions in manufacturing support, where it has seen success with its microbial solutions, which provides in vitro (non-animal) testing products, biologics testing services, and avian vaccine services. However, we don't believe this segment possesses a moat. Despite this segment being a high-growth and high-margin business, the competitive landscape for manufacturing support is very fragmented, and Charles River competes with large life sciences tools companies and smaller niche providers in this space.","We believe Charles River warrants a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, largely due to its high dependence on R&D spending among its clients. The company is subject to risk from underutilizing capacity, which is more likely in an economic downturn or decline in biopharma funding. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges that affects clinical trial work; however, the company has adapted well and seems to have rebounded from pandemic-related client disruptions. The increased penetration of outsourcing since the economic downturn of 2008 also gives us confidence that the biopharma industry is more dependent on CROs now than in the past. Charles River is susceptible to changes in regulatory standards, which currently require the use of research models before human clinical trials. From an ESG perspective, many parties object to the use of animals in drug experimentation. However, we believe the use of research models will remain an integral part of drug development, as alternatives such as in vitro (test tubes) and in silico (computer simulation) testing do not fully replicate the in vivo dynamics. Further, Charles River focuses on rodents, which seem to be less controversial to animal rights groups than larger models, such as canines and nonhuman primates. Product governance is also a key ESG risk for Charles River and the rest of the CRO industry. It must ensure that trials and animal models meet strict quality and safety standards from a variety of regulatory entities. The company is exposed to the risk of potentially losing market share to competitors if its trials lag on quality.Additionally, biopharma consolidation could result in periods of disruption as a newly merged company may deprioritize some early-stage work or freeze trials while weighing integration strategy. However, we don't foresee consolidation with large biopharma to have a significant impact in the long-term due to a diverse client base that includes small, midsize, and large biotech clients.","We assign Charles River a Standard capital allocation rating. Our analysis evaluates what we determine to be the three key facets of management decision-making from the perspective of shareholders: balance sheet strength, investment efficacy, and distributions. Our Standard rating results from a sound balance sheet, fair investment strategy, and an assessment of shareholder distributions as appropriate. Charles River's balance sheet is sound, with its revenue cyclicality and operating leverage each possessing a medium rating. The company ended 2022 with about $234 million in cash, and it recorded a net leverage ratio of 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA.We view Charles River's investment decisions as fair. While the company has established itself as the market leader in several of the spaces it operates in, we're wary of a few crucial mistakes in the past, such as the aggressive overspending on capacity in 2008 right before the economic downturn and the unsuccessful entry into clinical trials in the early 2010s. Recovering from the excess capacity issue in the late 2000s took several years, and the company was forced to sell much of the capacity it had recklessly bought. Then, the company's attempt to expand into clinical trials by acquiring WuXi PharmaTech, a Chinese CRO, for $1.6 billion was met with opposition from larger shareholders, resulting in a terminated deal and a $30 million breakup fee. Since then, management's acquisition strategy has been more shareholder-friendly, with the company focusing on smaller tuck-in acquisitions. In the last few years, with biotech funding continuing to increase and greater levels of outsourcing, the size of the company's acquisitions has ticked up, with purchases of preclinical competitors, WIL Research (for about $585 million), MPI Research (about $800 million), and Cognate BioServices ($875 million). The acquisitions of WIL Research and MPI Research have largely played out well and have been well integrated. We're watching to see how the recent acquisitions Citoxlab, HemaCare, Cognant BioServices, and Vigene Biosciences will play out, but the purchase prices of about $500 million, $380 million, $875 million, and $293 million, respectively, seem reasonable at this juncture. We like that management has been able to expand capacity mainly with tuck-in acquisitions rather than aggressive capital expenditures. By acquiring smaller competing facilities, Charles River acquires new client relationships and has better visibility into excess capacity compared with undertaking large capital expenditure projects. Most of its capital expenditure (which has remained a low- to mid-single-digit percentage of revenue) has been in growth areas such as emerging markets. The company is comfortable utilizing a responsible level of debt, and with the exception of 2018-2020 when the company prioritized internal investments, it has a history of share repurchases.Finally, we assess overall shareholder distributions as appropriate. Even though Charles River does not currently pay a dividend, we view this as appropriate since the company is growing quickly and investment helps build its value and support its narrow moat. Chairman and CEO James Foster has run the firm since 1992, and others on the management team, including chief commercial officer William Barbo and vice president of discovery and safety assessment Birgit Girshick, have been with the company since the 1990s or earlier. While we prefer to see the roles of CEO and chairman separated, the remainder of the board is made up of independent directors, which include former leaders of companies in the biopharma and life sciences industries. We also like that metrics such as return on invested capital and free cash flow are included in performance objectives that determine executive compensation, in addition to earnings per share and operating income.","Charles River Laboratories was founded in 1947 and is a leading provider of drug discovery and development services. The companys research model & services segment is the leading provider of animal models for laboratory testing, which breeds and delivers animal research models with specific genetic characteristics for preclinical studies around the world. The discovery & safety assessment segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process, including discovery services. The manufacturing support segment includes microbial solutions, which provides in vitro (non-animal) testing products, biologics testing services, and avian vaccine services. ","We believe Charles River is in fair financial health. We think the biggest risk to its financial position would be an overly aggressive expansion in capacity, but we believe the management team has exhibited caution during the recent boom in biotech funding. Charles River has consistently carried debt in the last decade, generally maintaining a level of 2-3 times adjusted EBITDA. This has ticked up slightly in the last few years to fund its acquisitions of WIL Research, MPI Research, Cognate BioServices, and Vigene Biosciences. Management aims to maintain a leverage ratio below 3 times adjusted EBITDA, but it is willing to temporarily exceed this target to take advantage of perceived opportunities in the marketplace. The company ended 2022 with $2.7 billion in total debt, representing a net leverage ratio of 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA.Charles Rivers generally stable cash flow should ease any investor concerns about the company meeting its debt obligations, and strong biotech funding levels over the near term should support stable growth from the company's preclinical exposure. Charles River had about $234 million of cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2022.",CRL,Healthcare,10345538560.0,NYQ,311088.0,USD,194.9499969482422,True,1,195.30835284064938,229.96950615777283,1
25/11/2023,BEH's Focus on Natural Gas Operation To Benefit From China's Promotion of Cleaner Energy,Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd,00392,4,31/08/2023,Jennifer Song,26.35,HKD,24/11/2023,39.5,High,Narrow,Standard,,31/08/2023,"Beijing Enterprises Holdings' 28% year-over-year fall in first-half recurring net profit to HKD 3.9 billion slightly missed our expectations. The result was damped by higher interest expenses, unfavorable exchange rates, and disappointing profit contribution from 23%-owned associate China Gas. Nevertheless, management expects improving second-half performance as gas demand picks up and the dollar margin benefits from cost pass-through policies. We lowered our 2023 recurring net profit forecast by 4% to HKD 7.8 billion to incorporate the weaker-than-expected results. This implies a 5% fall from a year ago. We maintain our HKD 39.50 fair value estimate. We believe the shares are undervalued as of the Aug. 31 market close, trading at only 0.4 times price/booka significant discount relative to the value of the underlying assets. Despite the earnings miss, the 86% year-over-year increase in interim dividend per share to HKD 0.93 is a positive highlight; this implies a payout ratio of 30% on recurring net profit, up from the 25% in 2022. Management has committed that it will raise the dividend payout ratio to 35% by 2025, which we think will help to restore investors confidence. Our forecast 2023 DPS of HKD 1.93 translates to about a 6.6% yield as of the Aug. 31 market close. With the completion of the massive investment in its LNG project, we think BEHs goal is achievable and could provide further support to its share price. Given that the gas utility business makes up the bulk of BEHs operating profit, we expect the company to continue to deliver steady earnings growth. As such, we forecast BEH's recurring net profit to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2022 and 2027.","Chinas policies to encourage the use of cleaner energy, such as natural gas, will continue to benefit leading city gas operators such as BEH. The 40% ownership of the Shaanxi-Beijing pipelines brings exposure to high-quality midstream transmission infrastructure and helps to secure the companys gas supply. The establishment of a national pipeline company is beneficial to city gas operators, as the opening of pipeline infrastructure to third parties will promote competition and encourage market pricing of natural gas.","BEHs cash flows largely depend on the dividends received from its subsidiaries and associates, while as an investment-heavy utility-focused company, the tight cash flows may continue to limit its dividend upside. Rising raw material prices may cap gas distributors' near-term dollar margin outlook. A prolonged Russia-Ukraine war raises the possibility that companies with business in Russia may face U.S. sanctions.",05/07/2023,"Founded in 1997, Beijing Enterprises Holdings is the listed flagship of the Beijing municipal government, with a strategic focus on public utilities. It has a monopoly position in Beijings natural gas distribution, owns unparalleled gas transmission and distribution networks in Beijing, and controls 40% of the Shaanxi-Beijing pipelines, the major source of natural gas supply for Beijing and northern China. It has a unique customer mix, with gas-fired power and heating plants the most prominent demand segments, allowing the company to benefit from a favorable policy environment. With the production of natural gas involving fewer emissions compared with coal, we think China will continue to encourage the use of natural gas, which should drive maintainable and robust gas demand. We think BEH's key strength is its high-quality, well-located gas network with monopoly operation, providing the company with maintainable and robust cash inflows. This underpins our narrow economic moat rating.  Chinas reliance on cheap and plentiful coal to fuel its economic growth has had clear environmental consequences, and Beijing provides the most prominent example of the particulate-laden air. Serious air pollution has led to the State Council urging reductions in coal use, and Beijing became the first city in China to implement coal-to-gas conversion. As of 2022, natural gas consumption constituted about 34% of the city's total energy consumption, well above the national average of 8% and the global average of 24%. Given the high base, we think further growth in the city will be much lower than the nationwide outlook. Nevertheless, BEHs expansion in the broader Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei areas, and stricter air quality controls in these cities, should still drive 3%-5% annual volume growth over the next five years.  BEH also invests in water treatment and waste-to-energy projects. We expect BEH's business segments in public utilities to continue stable growth, while its investment in the Russia oil and gas company, as well as its 80% stake in Yanjing Brewery, will bring higher cyclical risk to the company. ","We assign BEH a narrow economic moat rating that is derived from its monopoly over Beijings natural gas distribution, which, along with its investments in the Shaanxi-Beijing Transmission pipeline and China Gas, contribute more than two thirds of group earnings. In our view, the companys high-quality, well-located gas network, coupled with a unique customer mix that offers maintainable competitive advantages, benefits from efficient scale as the monopoly gas operator in Beijing, along with intangible assets from its multidecade monopoly concession rights for gas distribution and transmission.BEH is one of the largest state-owned enterprises in China. Its monopoly gas distribution network, coupled with strong government support, creates a very high entry barrier, making it unlikely that new competitors will emerge. BEH also controls 40% of the Shaanxi-Beijing pipelines, a major source of natural gas supply for Beijing and north China. The ownership of these midstream pipelines not only strengthens the companys competitive advantages in gas supply. Unlike most industry peers, which have more than 50% residential usage, BEH has only about 20%. This favorable customer mix allows it to earn relatively stable margins, as gas tariffs for nonresidential users can be passed on automatically if upstream gas prices increase. However, for residential users, requests for price hikes need to be approved following a public hearing. While the higher costs are generally passed through with a few months' delay on process, there is also a small risk that they might not be passed through, owing to government concerns regarding inflation.Serious air pollution is prompting Beijing to actively promote the use of natural gas via gas-fired power and heating plants at the expense of coal. The network of piped gas is expanding, and LNG stations are being built, promoting gas-powered autos. Old style coal-fired boilers and power plants were reworked to burn gas. The citys centralized heating service was also transitioned to gas-driven from coal-fired. BEH is positioned to benefit from the favorable policy environment, as natural gas has eventually become one of Beijing's leading energy sources.In addition to gas operations, BEH also invests in water treatment and the beer business. While we dont believe these business segments possess an economic moat, they are solid businesses and do not materially detract from its narrow economic moat, which stems from the monopoly gas business in Beijing and provides the bulk of BEH's earnings. BEH provides water-treatment services through its 41%-owned Beijing Enterprises Water, one of Chinas top water companies, focusing on municipal water supply and waste water treatment. While BEW has a leading position in waste water treatment, an industry with a strong capacity growth outlook, we do not believe it possesses an economic moat. Chinas municipal waste water treatment industry is fragmented, with the top five players together accounting for only 14% of the market in terms of capacity. Waste water treatment projects are capital-intensive, but the entry barrier is not high, so private investors are allowed to enter this market. Because the industry is still in the early stages, future competition is likely to be high. However, with returns of 8%-10% in general, similar to BEHs gas business, we do not believe BEHs water materially detracts from the overall economic moat.BEH also owns 80% of Yanjing Brewery, China's third-largest domestic brewer. Yanjing has a dominant position in Beijing, with more than 80% market share. However, compared with industry peer Tsingtao, we dont believe it has a maintainable competitive advantage from brands or cost advantage from scale. Its products don't sell at a premium price, nor do they generate peer-beating operating margins, and the brewery lacks synergies with BEHs utility-heavy portfolio.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for BEH, to reflect the additional risk on the company's 20% stake in VCNG, an oil producing venture in Russia with Rosneft, as a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war raises the possibility that companies with business in Russia may face U.S. sanctions. The companys downstream city gas business is defensive and enjoys a favorable pass-through mechanism, as gas tariffs are generally passed on to end users once upstream gas prices are increased. Thus, potential regulatory changes remains a risk. Any change in the current pass-through mechanism, or a failure to pass through gas costs, would be detrimental to BEH.Gas demand in Beijing is seasonal. Warmer winters could see shorter heating periods, leading to soft gas sales volumes.Scarcity of gas in mainland China could also weigh on profitability if it reduces sales volumes, given the sizable asset base for gas distributors, which could result in increasing gas imports and push up the gas purchase cost, pressuring margins for gas distributors.In addition, BEHs strong relations with the central government--reflecting its status as a state-owned enterprise, or SOE, mean business decisions may be influenced by government directives, and it may also be pressured by the government to pursue investments that are not conducive to promoting shareholder value.Emissions, effluents and waste, community relations and occupational health and safety are key environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks for BEH, while the company's overall exposure is medium and is moderately below subindustry average. ","We assign BEH a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. For the past decade, management has achieved decent profit growth, averaging 13.8% annually, while maintaining a solid financial position between 2011 and 2021. However, its dividend payout ratio is relatively low, being consistently below 30% over the past 10 years. With the maintainable and robust business outlook, we expect and encourage management to raise the dividend payouts in coming years.With 62% of the company owned by the Beijing municipal government, BEHs investments are likely influenced by government decisions, which may conflict with shareholder interests. Past investments have mostly been prudent and in the interests of shareholders, while maintaining a maintainable capital structure. The company used to own a diversified portfolio of assets, with businesses in dairy, retail, winery, tourism, and toll roads, among others. Beginning in 2004, the company underwent a strategic restructuring, shifting to public utilities as its core business and selling noncore assets. The core business has a strong competitive advantage, and we believe the decision to focus on it is in the best interests of all shareholders.Returns for the current utility businesses exceed the costs of capital, and we consider the firms capital allocation to be reasonable. However, if the company proposed or started to make material investments in low-returning projects, potentially those promoted by the government, this would detract from our overall view of the companys capital allocation rating.","Beijing Enterprises Holdings was founded in 1997 and it is the listed flagship of the Beijing municipal government. It has a diversified business portfolio with focus on public utilities, including gas distribution and transmission, sewage and water treatment, and waste-to-energy business. It also invests in an upstream Russia oil and gas company, and owns 80% of Yanjing Brewery, one of the leading domestic brewers. The business mix is approximately 70% in gas operation, with the rest in water, waste treatment, and beer businesses.","BEH is in sound financial health.

24/11/2023,"Despite Renewables Push, Equinor Remains a Way to Play Higher Oil and Gas Prices While Getting Paid",Equinor ASA,EQNR,3,27/10/2023,Allen Good,32.2,USD,23/11/2023,34.0,High,,Standard,,27/10/2023,"Equinors third-quarter adjusted earnings decreased to $8.0 billion before tax and $2.7 billion after tax, compared with $24.5 billion and $7.2 billion last year, respectively, because of oil and natural gas prices falling from extraordinary levels in 2022. Operating cash flow, excluding working capital and taxes, was $11.3 billion during the quarter compared with $24.5 billion in 2022. Capital expenditure totaled $2.6 billion and is still expected to be $10 billion-$11 billion for the full year. During the quarter, Equinor paid its ordinary dividend of $0.30, a special dividend of $0.60, and bought back $1.67 billion of shares. Given the strong financial performance and large cash balance, it will move forward with the fourth and final tranche of its $6 billion repurchase plan for 2023 with $1.67 billion in repurchases for the fourth quarter. Despite falling earnings, Equinor reiterated its 2023 plan to return $17.0 billion to shareholders. While oil and gas prices have fallen, prices are still above recent past levels. In addition, Equinor has been able to continue its payouts given its third-quarter leverage of negative 22.9%, while many peers have reduced expected payouts because of variable distribution targets and weaker balance sheets. Our fair value estimate and moat rating are unchanged. Equinor, one of the cheaper integrated names in our coverage last quarter, is now fairly valued. The upstream business saw volumes decrease 1% from the prior year largely because of unplanned extended turnarounds on the Troll A platform and the third-party lowering gas volumes. Upstream adjusted earnings decreased to $7.2 billion compared with $22.9 billion the year before. Marketing segment adjusted earnings fell to $876 million from $1.6 billion the prior year, largely because of reduced gas market volatility and diminished geographical spreads that allowed for strong gas and power results in 2022.","Recent discoveries on the NCS in the Barents Sea indicate that resources remain and allow the company to use existing infrastructure to add incremental production at high returns. Equinor benefits from its proximity to continental Europe as it can capitalize on high natural gas prices and efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas by increasing production.  Equinor is leveraging its experience developing projects in harsh offshore environments to build offshore wind projects, in order to diversify its business away from oil and gas in preparation for the energy transition.","Equinor's investments in renewables might not generate the returns its oil and gas investments historically have, resulting in a dilution of returns. Large repurchase programs risk being value destructive if done at the top of the cycle.  By introducing explicit power generation and spending goals, Equinor risks overpaying for new projects to hit targets. ",15/08/2023,"Equinor is accelerating its push into renewable energy in pursuit of its 2050 net-zero goal. Central to its strategy is growth of its burgeoning offshore wind business. While net installed capacity only stands at 0.6 gigawatts at end-2022, Equinor plans to grow that to 12-16 GW by 2030, a target it previously set for 2035. To do so, it plans to increase renewable spending from 12% of total capital investment to over 50% by 2030, including a cumulative gross $23 billion over the next five years. Capital will also go toward carbon transportation and storage, like its Northern Lights project, and clean hydrogen projects where Equinor plans to leverage its experience in each area to develop its pipeline of projects with the aim of becoming an industry leader. The strategy contrasts with many peers as it's more focused and related to existing operations than peers, which are pushing into all varieties of renewable power generation or distribution and low-carbon businesses. Despite the growth in renewables, oil and gas will remain the cash flow and earnings driver for the foreseeable future. Wind power capacity growth should accelerate mid-decade and earnings wont be material until the end of the decade. Equinors hydrocarbon strategy mimics peers as it is focused on investing in its highest-quality assets while divesting smaller, noncore areas. New projects coming on stream by 2030 break even at less than $35/barrel and payback in less than 2.5 years on average according to Equinor. The Norwegian Continental Shelf, where Equinor has a wealth of operating experience, remains central to the company's strategy. Volumes are set to grow a 2% compound growth rate through 2026. Equinor also plans to further leverage existing infrastructure in the area to add future volumes at high returns. Meanwhile, the area figures into future decarbonization plans given the low carbon intensity of its production and opportunities for offshore wind, carbon storage and hydrogen projects. Internationally, Equinor is prioritizing free cash flow from its operations by focusing on key projects in fewer offshore areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Brazil where returns should exceed 20%.  ","Thanks to its dominant position on the NCS, Equinor holds some competitive advantages relative to peers. The focus on a single area allowed the firm to gain in-depth knowledge of the region relative to its rivals while building out significant infrastructure that lowered the capital cost of incremental production. However, given a high tax burden in Norway, Equinor has historically failed to match the aftertax upstream earnings margins or returns on capital of its higher quality peers. Given the uneven recent history of returns and the narrow forecast for excess returns at our midcycle price of $60/bb, we do not award Equinor an economic moat. That said, Equinor has made great progress on reducing capital spending, improving its cost structure, and bolstering the economics of projects under development or delaying higher-cost and lower-return projects. Also, thanks to recent discoveries, Equinor is reversing years of declining volumes on the NCS and developing projects that will leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure. New projects should add 700 mboe/d through 2026, resulting in a 2% compound annual growth rate. This should lead to the addition of higher-margin, lower-capital barrels, which will improve returns from recent levels. Discovered resources during the last two years have a break-even of $30/bbl while the company has identified 1.5 billion boe of volumes improved oil recovery techniques that leverage existing infrastructure and break even at $25/bbl. Similar progress has been made in Equinors international operations where it plans to only operate offshore projects and exit countries where it has smaller, lower-quality positions like Nicaragua, Mexico and Australia. Additional exits or divestments beyond those announced will likely occur, further narrowing the portfolio to the highest-quality areas. Equinor estimates its project portfolio, should deliver 30% returns at $70/bbl, suggesting low-cost incremental production. Foremost among its international growth options is Equinors Brazilian position which should deliver steady growth during the next decade as a string of projects with low-break-even levels come online. Producing about 50 mb/d currently, Brazil could contribute over 200 mb/d for Equinor by 2030. Although Equinor was an early mover into offshore wind and arguably has crossover capability and experience, particularly in the NCS, from its oil operations, we do not see it as having a competitive advantage in this business. Although, its experience and assets in Norway, combined with a large concentrated geographical footprint, might at some point carve out a cost advantage, it is uncertain at this point. Furthermore, weve seen a rush of competitors into the segment give its lack of barriers to entry that has compressed returns. As a result, in its most recent update Equinor lowered its nominal unleveraged return expectations to 6%-10% from 8%-12% previously. That said, Equinor expects to deliver higher equity returns of 12%-16% through leverage, farm downs and targeting higher rates in emerging markets. We expect competitors to do the same, however, which could ultimately pressure returns everywhere given the abundance of bids on new projects and availability of developed projects in the secondary market. Carbon capture and hydrogen production might also provide an opportunity to form a moat around cost and experience, but it remains far too early to determine winners in those sectors. Equinor is exposed to several environmental, social, and governance-related risks, but these have no bearing on our final moat rating as most are too long-term for moat consideration or are not probable or material enough risk to cause material value destruction. Equinors primary ESG risk stems from carbon emissions in its operations and use of its products and emissions, effluents and waste generated in operations such as oil spills. The risk from carbon emissions is most likely to materialize through a carbon tax, which increases the price of end products to consumers, reducing demand over time and threatening Equinors hydrocarbon business. We expect carbon taxes to gain greater adoption over time, but think the impact on hydrocarbon demand remains more than a decade away. Furthermore, Equinors strategic plans call for a move away from hydrocarbons, which should insulate it to a greater degree than peers from any carbon tax. Also, its production has some of the lowest-carbon intensity in the sector and should fall further as Equinor targets reductions and invests in greater electrification of offshore fields. Oil spills are an ever-present risk for oil companies operating offshore and can be devastating to a firm's value as BPs Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico shows. While oil companies regularly cause spills, most are immaterial in size and associated fines and cleanup costs are manageable. Meanwhile, large sills such as Macondo are very rare and do not factor into any of our scenario modeling. ","Equinor holds a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High, based on fundamental exposure to commodity prices, evaluation of ESG risks, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system.As the firm is an oil and gas producer, Equinor's profits are highly sensitive to commodity prices. The company's enhanced oil recovery and exploration projects are no longer economically viable when commodity prices drop below certain thresholds. Internationally, Equinor often needs to rely on local governments or other operators in difficult exploration environments. Future profits also depend on the success of large, complicated, international projects that are inherently risky. Although Equinor is attempting to leverage its offshore expertise into investments in offshore wind, it's unclear if that knowledge will translate or be applicable. Furthermore, Equinor risks overpaying to secure new projects as other firms increase competition for such opportunities, which would weigh on returns. In the long term, greater adoption of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and ride-sharing could reduce demand for oil and refined products. Natural gas demand could be replaced by greater renewables adoption.Equinor holds several ESG-related risks but based on our framework are not collectively material enough to alter our scenario analysis determined uncertainty rating. ESG-related risks include changes in policy related to climate change such as a carbon tax that could result in higher costs, reduced demand, or stranded resources. Operating in offshore environments exposes Equinor to the risk of large oil spills that could result in material losses through lost revenue, fines or penalties, or loss of license to operate. Although Equinor has a track record of safe operations.","Based on our capital allocation framework, which evaluates soundness of the balance sheet, investment strategy and appropriateness of shareholder distributions, Equinor earns a Standard rating.Equinors business has a high amount of operating leverage as well as revenue cyclicality, but it has maintained reasonable leverage levels despite a crash in oil prices in 2020. Instead of incurring excess debt or diluting shareholders with a scrip dividend, it cut the dividend in early 2020. Although net debt increased through 2020, it has fallen since and as of 2022 the net debt/capital ratio sits well below managements target range. Near-term maturities are also relatively low and can be refinanced if need be. All of which amounts to a sound balance sheet in our framework. We rate Equinors investment strategy as fair given its balanced approach and focus on higher quality assets and areas where it can carve out a competitive advantage. Although it is diversifying into renewables, it will continue to invest in its hydrocarbon business. Unlike some peers, it plans to grow oil and gas production through 2026 while growing its renewable portfolio. Although renewables generate lower returns, Equinors primary focus is on offshore wind where we believe it's easier to establish a competitive advantage and it can leverage some of its expertise in harsh offshore conditions. In early 2020, Equinor cut its dividend by 67% and suspended its share repurchase program given the deterioration in oil prices. Its current plan is to grow the dividend in line with earnings and considering cash flow, capital spending requirements. It will also return cash through repurchases and an extraordinary dividend which are more flexible. Although investors were stung by the cut, the dividend has since been increased above prior levels. ","Equinor is a Norway-based integrated oil and gas company. It has been publicly listed since 2001, but the government retains a 67% stake. Operating primarily on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the firm produced 2.0 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022 (50% liquids) and ended the year with 5.2 billion barrels of proven reserves (49% liquidsl). Operations also include offshore wind, solar, oil refineries and natural gas processing, marketing, and trading.","As of mid-2023, Equinor held negative net debt of $12.9 billion, excluding leases, for a net debt/capital ratio of negative 35.1%, as cash piled up thanks to high commodity prices. It aims to maintain a ratio of 15%-30% or 20%-35% including leases through the cycle.Capital spending will be between $10 billion-$11 billion in 2023 before rising to about $13 billion through 2026. Longer-term spending plans will likely rely on the path of commodity prices and pace of renewable investment.After reducing the dividend to $0.09 per share from $0.27 in early 2020, Equinor has since increased several times so it now stands at $0.30 per share. In addition, given the strong market conditions and large cash balance it has introduced an extraordinary dividend, which currently pays $0.60/share, but continuation is dependent on high commodity prices. Equinor also returned to repurchasing shares in 2021. Its latest plans are to repurchase up to $6 billion in 2023 as it did in 2022, of which $1.2 billion is an annual long-term buyback and the rest an extraordinary amount given strong performance. The annual long-term amount should persist, but any extraordinary amount will depend on commodity price levels. Regardless, the program demonstrates management's willingness to return surplus cash flow to shareholders. In 2023, Equinor plans to return $17 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.

24/11/2023,Search Disruption Won't Result in Google Displacement,Alphabet Inc,GOOGL,4,20/11/2023,Ali Mogharabi,138.49,USD,23/11/2023,161.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,20/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $161 fair value estimate on Alphabet, as we do not expect the latest events around OpenAI and Microsoft to significantly affect Google's artificial intelligence capabilities in the short or long term. Google remains in the same position as before the OpenAI ordeal, facing Microsoft, with access to OpenAI technology, in a race to develop features and uses that solve real-world problems. On Nov. 17, the board of OpenAI fired co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, which led to co-founder Greg Brockman announcing his departure. Altman and Brockman have joined Microsoft and a large percentage of talent at OpenAI will likely follow the co-founders. We still think that Google and other firms will also have an opportunity to attract a few OpenAI employees to their teams, including Google DeepMind. We remain confident about the resources and talent at hand at DeepMind, but we think the firm will need to increase its investments there more aggressively. Google may also try to acquire Anthropic, one of the leading independent artificial intelligence firms. Amazon may also be considering the same, as both have stakes in Anthropic. However, such an attempt could result in more antitrust scrutiny. We expect more internal pressure at Google to accelerate its efforts to match or exceed OpenAI, and now the Altman and Brockman team at Microsoft. According to some reports, Gemini, which was considered Google's better version of GPT-4, has been delayed until the first quarter of next year. While we do not think this will affect its cloud revenue much in the fourth quarter, the firm must meet the deadline next quarter. Otherwise, the patience of some current or potential cloud clients could wear thin, possibly affecting cloud revenue growth in 2024.","As the number of online users and usage increase, so will digital ad spending, of which Google will remain one of the main beneficiaries. Androids dominant global market share of smartphones leaves Google well positioned to continue generating top-line growth as search traffic shifts from desktop to mobile. The significant cash generated from the Google search business allows Alphabet to remain focused on innovation and the long-term growth opportunities that new areas present.","There is little revenue diversification within Alphabet, as it remains heavily dependent on Google and the state of the search ad space. Alphabet is allocating too much capital toward high-risk bets, which face a very low probability of generating returns. Googles dominant position in online search is not maintainable, as more companies and regulatory agencies are contesting the methods through which the company has been extending its leadership.",24/07/2023,"Alphabet dominates the online search market with 90%-plus global share (80%-plus U.S. share) for Google, via which it generates strong cash flow. We expect continuing search growth as we remain confident that Google will maintain its leadership despite Microsoft moving first to include generative artificial intelligence in Bing search. We also foresee YouTube and cloud contributing more to the firms top and bottom lines. Finally, we view investments in moonshots as attractive, with significant uncertainty but also substantial upside.  Googles ecosystem strengthens as its products are adopted by more users, making its online advertising services more attractive to advertisers and publishers and resulting in increased online ad revenue. We think ad revenue can continue to grow at high-single-digit rates during the next five years. The firm utilizes technological innovation to improve the user experience in nearly all its Google offerings, while making the sale and purchase of ads efficient for publishers and advertisers. Adoption and usage of mobile devices has been increasing. The online advertising market has taken notice and has followed its target audience onto the mobile platform. We have seen Google partake in this on the back of its Android mobile operating systems growing market share, helping it drive revenue growth and maintain its leadership in the space. Among the firms investment areas, we particularly applaud the efforts to gain a stronger foothold in the fast-growing public cloud market. Google has quickly leveraged the technological expertise it applied to creating and maintaining its private cloud platform to increase its market share in this area, driving additional revenue growth and creating more operating leverage, which we expect will continue. Most of Alphabets more futuristic projects are not yet generating revenue, but the upside is attractive if they succeed, as the firm is targeting newer markets. Alphabets autonomous car technology business, Waymo, is a good example: Based on various studies, it may tap into a market valued in the tens of billions of dollars within the next 10-15 years. ","We assign Alphabet a wide moat rating, thanks to durable competitive advantages derived from the companys intangible assets, as well as the network effect.We believe Alphabet holds significant intangible assets related to overall technological expertise in search algorithms and artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning), as well as access to and accumulation of data that is deemed valuable to advertisers. We also believe that Googles brand is a significant asset; ""Google it"" has become eponymous with searching, and regardless of actual technological competency, the firms search engine is perceived as being the most advanced in the industry. While with Microsofts Bing is attempting to dethrone Google with AI technology from OpenAI, we think the firm can defend its dominance in search with its own AI technology, some of which OpenAIs products are based on.In our opinion, Alphabets network effects are derived mainly through its Google products such as Search, Android, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and more. Ultimately, we view Googles network as heterogeneous. On the one side, all the products Google offers have provided it with a massive consumer base that allows the company to collect data. On the other side, via its rich collection of data and large user base, Google can offer the best return on investment for advertisers and build a growing network of advertising customers. The addition of each new ad and advertiser improves the efficiency of Googles programmatic advertising offerings, allowing the firm to better monetize the network.In search, Google has successfully and consistently monetized many of its technology-based intangible assets, from the original algorithms behind search to the current machine learning ones and the deep learning-based generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), which are also being applied to nearly every product. The company was recognized first for its ""extremely relevant results"" by PC Magazine in December 1998. From that point, it grew into the worlds most popular online search engine and has maintained its leadership. Google processes more than 3 times and 4 times as many search requests as Bing (Microsoft) and Yahoo, respectively. Google Searchs success stems from the relevance of its results to its users and the likelihood that this relevance will improve as more data is gathered and analyzed, assumptions are generated, and predictions are created. Google has used machine learning technology to improve the user experience. The company has applied machine learning to Search (speech recognition), Gmail (Smart Reply), Google Photos, Maps, and many other products, including its cloud offerings. As technological advancements improve the user experience for each product, the likelihood of further usage increases. The firm is also applying generative AI to enhance its search engines communication and response with users. Products with those features include Bard and the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which the firm is testing in its Search Labs. With generative AI in search, while clicks will likely decline, the search engine will have more data regarding users interest, which it can use for contextual campaigns for advertisers.Based initially on its technology, Google has successfully increased its users dependence on its products to keep transforming the usage of those products into something habitual. We have seen that with online search, as most people around the world continue to ""Google it."" It has strengthened its brand, which we think has longevity. We view the Google brand as a significant driver of user growth for YouTube, Maps, Gmail, and Chrome. Again, an expanding user base helps the company collect more data, which is monetized when applied to online ads.Google searchs large and growing user base has created a network difficult to replicate, in our view. We believe that an additional search on Googles search engine creates value for other users, as well as for advertisers and businesses. With AI (machine learning and deep learning) technology, more requests made by current and/or new users improve relevancy of search results, creating value for users. More relevant results also decrease the likelihood of users jumping to another search engine, creating somewhat of a barrier to exit.For advertisers, value is created mainly through growth of the large user base to target and from behavioral data compiled and analyzed. As users and search requests grow and more data is gathered, advertisers demands for ads increase, helping Google to further monetize the network. We think this can be strengthened in the long run with the application of generative AI.As with Google Search, we see network effects from large and growing user bases of other products, such as Maps, Gmail, and Chrome, all of which create value for users and advertisers. As more consumers use Maps, more data regarding traffic, commuting tendencies, and so forth is gathered, helping Google generate more accurate results (in terms of locations, travel times, and route suggestions). Google also utilizes such data to provide faster routes. Businesses and advertisers pay Google to place their search ads, targeted based on users locations and previous searches, within Maps search results list and directly on the map.Google's Chrome browser remains the market leader with nearly a 63% share, according to StatCounter, compared with over 20% for Apple's Safari and 5% for Microsoft's Edge. In our opinion, growth in Chrome browser usage helps increase the network effect for Google. In addition, by launching Android in 2007, Google positioned itself well in the faster-growing mobile ad market, maintaining its online search dominance and strengthening its network effect. According to IDC, Googles Android OS powers more than 87% of smartphones around the world, compared with Apple iOS' slightly over 12%. With Googles Chrome browser on Android phones, more mobile searches are conducted using Google. We note, however, that Google makes annual payments to Apple and Samsung for its search engine to be the default option on their mobile devices. Androids network effect also creates more value for users. As the number of Android-powered smartphones increases, more developers will create more apps to be made available on Google Play and run on those smartphones, creating additional value for Android smartphone users.We think YouTube is also valuable, as it benefits from a network effect that creates value for users, content creators, and advertisers. With more viewers on the site today, more content creators will look to YouTube for content distribution. Continuing growth of YouTubes content library drives further viewer growth. YouTubes video platform has more viewers than other online video properties, making it attractive for advertisers. We expect Google to gain a foothold in the growing enterprise cloud market, but we do not think its cloud offerings create a network effect. Although Amazon is clearly the leader in this space, we expect Google to gain further traction and trail only Amazon Web Services and Microsofts Azure in market share. Ultimately, we believe Google can leverage the technological expertise (including machine learnings and deep learning AI) it applied to creating and maintaining its private cloud platform to build and maintain public cloud platforms for many businesses.Regarding other potential moat sources, we do not believe Alphabet has a durable cost advantage when compared with its peers. Alphabets size allows it to invest heavily in Maps and YouTube, and perhaps in more capital-intensive businesses like enterprise cloud or Google Fiber. However, we dont see an inherent cost advantage in Alphabet that other tech titans like Apple and Amazon cant replicate, especially since cloud hardware is becoming increasingly commodified.We believe that customer switching costs provide Alphabet with only a negligible competitive advantage. Alphabets Google offerings, such as search, YouTube, Android, Maps, and Gmail, have some switching costs associated with time and effort needed to learn a new user interface, move content to another platform (YouTube) and notify contacts of an email change (Gmail), but such costs are not so prohibitive that these customers are locked in forever.Finally, while Alphabet generates economic profit through Google, which we think will continue, this profit would be higher were it not for Alphabets efforts to remaining a step ahead in terms of innovation. In its other bets segment, Alphabet is betting on (or investing in) using technology to enhance health (Verily), self-driving cars (Waymo), and much more. Some of these wagers may not bring in any winnings, and we believe it is too early to consider these businesses as contributors to Alphabets economic moat, either in terms of intangible assets or network effects.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Alphabet is High, primarily the result of high dependency on continuing online advertising growth. While we remain confident that Google will maintain its dominant position in the search market, a long-lasting downturn in online ad spending could have a negative impact on Alphabets revenue and cash flow, resulting in a lower fair value estimate. On the other hand, positive returns on Alphabets investments in cloud and moonshots could increase our fair value estimate considerably. Although the moat sources of intangible assets and network effect will help Google retain its competitive advantages, minimal switching cost to utilize a rival search engine remains a risk for the company. This risk remains manageable, in our view, as Microsofts Bing, the nearest competitor and the first-mover in enhancing search with generative AI capabilities, currently does not have significant presence in the mobile market, which is one of the main growth drivers of the search ad market. Google also has generative AI technology to defend its over 90% global search market share. The firms high dependence on user behavior data also represents an environmental, social, and governance risk, mainly due to risks related to data privacy and security, which could affect not only Googles advertising business but also users trust in the firms products as data can be misused.Google faces antitrust pressure and various claims and investigations brought by different companies and regulatory agencies regarding search bias and its overall market dominance in online advertising. Some governments may simply forbid access to some of Googles properties, which could result in lower user growth and monetization. Similar to Meta, Google also faces limitations in mergers and acquisitions as the U.S. and other countries attempt to lessen the firms dominance in advertising and the overall internet market.","We assign Alphabet a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Exemplary. The balance sheet remains sound. As the overall digital advertising market continues to mature, Alpahbets main source of revenue is becoming more cyclical. With more than $115 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only around $14 billion in debt (as of the end of first quarter 2023), Alphabets leverage ratios remain very low. We think continuing growth in Googles business-to-business segment, Google Cloud, will help offset this cyclicality. Alphabets strong network effect moat source should create operating leverage, albeit partially offset by increased legal and other costs related to data privacy and security issues, along with lobbying on the antitrust front. In any case, Alphabets financial health is virtually assured.On the investment front, we view the firms decisions as exceptional. Alphabets R&D investments (which have been growing at 15% in the last three years) remain at around 14%-16% as a percentage of revenue. Microsofts addition of generative AI features to Bing search is only the most recent possible technology disruption that supports our view that Googles continuing high R&D investments are justified. While the firm is not the first to commercialize its generative AI capabilities, we consider Google as a front-runner in AI. In  fact, generative pre-training transformer, or GPT, the technology created by OpenAI and used by Microsoft Bing, is based on an architecture that Google developed in 2017, which is widely used by other AI technology providers. In addition, Google has developed various technology which have similar capabilities to GPT and other AI-based products. Alphabet also continues to invest in various high-risk and high-reward projects, which if successful could generate significant returns for the company. Investment in autonomous vehicle technology (Waymo), is just one example. It appears that management aims to remain ahead of the pack by acquiring valuable assets to utilize and build upon, as it did with Android, YouTube, DoubleClick, AdMob, Motorola Mobility, Looker, and Fitbit. Management likely will continue making acquisitions and investments in futuristic projects, including artificial intelligence.In terms of shareholder distributions, Alphabet does not currently pay a dividend but it has implemented share-repurchase programs consistently. The firm repurchased shares totaling $18.4 billion, $31.1 billion, $50.3 billion, and $59 billion in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In late 2015, Alphabet became a holding company, with Google as one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Alphabet is also the parent company of other businesses, mostly moonshots, which are grouped into the other bets segment that includes Waymo. This structure has provided slightly more transparency to shareholders, as the companys mature cash-generating business, Google, is managed separately. In our opinion, such a move may indicate that management is considering some form of redistribution of cash generated by Google to shareholders a few years down the road.Under this structure, Larry Page, who co-founded Google and is a director, was the CEO of the parent company Alphabet. Sergey Brin, the other co-founder of Google and a director of Alphabet, was the president of the firm. In December 2019, Page and Brin left their roles (but remained on the board) and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, also became the CEO of Alphabet. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and was its product chief before becoming CEO in 2015. Susan Wojcicki, who has been with Google since 1999 and convinced Google to acquire YouTube, became CEO of YouTube in 2014. Thomas Kurian, former president of Oracles product development group, became the CEO of Google Cloud in 2019. Ruth Porat is the CFO of Alphabet and Google. She was CFO at Morgan Stanley before coming to Alphabet in 2015.Although managements decisions have generated exceptional returns for shareholders in the past, and are likely to continue doing so, we remain watchful regarding the high concentration of voting power. Page, Brin, and former CEO and former executive chair Eric E. Schmidt still have more than 55% voting power. In addition, given Alphabets multiclass share structure, it appears that this high concentration of power will remain intact in the long run, which could result in a significant conflict of interest if the cofounders and Schmidt, who is no longer with the firm, make too many high-risk wagers on futuristic projects. However, we have not seen any indications of this.","Alphabet is a holding company. Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google generates 99% of Alphabet revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Googles other revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as cloud service fees and other licensing revenue. Sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home, also contribute to other revenue. Alphabets moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), provide faster internet access (Google Fiber), enable self-driving cars (Waymo), and more. ","Alphabet has a very strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $114 billion and total debt of nearly $15 billion at the end of 2022. The company also has a $4 billion revolver with no outstanding balance. Over 60% of the companys cash and cash equivalents is held outside the U.S. The company generated $91.5 billion in cash from operations in 2022, flat compared with 2021. We expect cash from operations to grow 13% annually through 2027. While we see a return to double-digit top-line growth, we also expect the firm to continue to invest in innovation. Alphabets free cash flow to equity/gross revenue ratio averaged 24% over the past three years, which indicates strong operational and financial health. We model a five-year average FCFE/sales ratio of 28% through 2027.",GOOGL,Communication Services,1658970308608.0,NMS,31442263.0,USD,138.49000549316406,True,1,132.79729443718938,140.27555621111728,0
24/11/2023,"Geopolitical Headwinds Crimp Norwegian's Near-Term Outlook, but Global Demand Still Robust",Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd,NCLH,4,,Jaime Katz,14.39,USD,23/11/2023,24.5,Very High,,Standard,C,,No Text Available,"As Norwegian is smaller than its North American cruise peers, it has the ability to deploy its assets nimbly as cruising demand rises, allowing for strategic pricing tactics. The elimination of virus-related regulations provide less friction for attracting a wider cohort of consumers, which could lead to demand growth faster than we currently expect. Norwegian has capitalized on leisure industry knowledge from its prior sponsors as well as the inclusion of high-end Regent Seven Seas and Oceania brands, sharing best practices across brands.","Weakness in consumer spending spurred by an economic downturn could affect discretionary spending, leading pricing to soften and lower onboard spending. Lack of credit availability could prevent inexpensive financing of new ship builds, slowing capacity growth, if export credit facility incentives wane. Persistently higher fuel prices could hinder the cost structure to a greater degree than we forecast, due to Norwegian's partially floating energy prices (with around 45% of its remaining 2023 fuel costs hedged).",13/11/2023,"Changes to consumer behavior surrounding travel as a result of the coronavirus had altered the economic performance of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, affecting its ability to generate excess economic rents. As consumers returned to cruising after the 15-month sailing halt that ended in July 2021, cruise operators added COVID-19-related protocols, which proved successful (as evidenced by lower positivity rates than on land) to reassure passengers of the safety of cruising in addition to the value proposition the holiday provides. However, with ships now fully deployed at normal occupancy levels, pricing has been restored, set to surpass prepandemic levels in 2023. Still, Norwegian could intermittently see pricing competition as global supply shifts to focus disproportionately on the North American consumer, containing yield upside. On the cost side, higher oil prices and unfavorable foreign exhange could keep costs elevated in 2023. However, we expect both pricing and costs to normalize over time, rising at a low-single-digit rate longer term. Altogether, these factors lead to average returns on invested capital, including goodwill, that we think are set to fall below our 10% weighted average cost of capital estimate until 2028, supporting our no-moat rating. While we believe Norwegian has carved out a compelling position in cruising thanks to its freestyle offering, the product still has to compete with other land-based vacations and discretionary spending for wallet share. We don't believe it will be challenging to capture the historical levels of spending over the near term, given the value proposition the cruise product offers. While liquidity issues appear to be alleviating for cruise operators, Norwegian can still opportunistically access the credit markets to optimize its interest-rate risk. Flexible refinancing across capital market efforts signals Norwegian's dedication to derisk the balance sheet over time as demand normalizes. Given that the firm should generate positive EBITDA throughout 2023, the $680 million in cash of Norwegian's balance sheet (as of September 2023) should provide liquidity for the firm to operate with over the near term.","We lowered our economic moat rating for Norwegian to none from narrow in 2020. While Norwegian had historically benefited from its brand intangible asset, cost advantage, and efficient scale moat sources, we believe these factors had been degraded, aggravated by the global spread of COVID-19 and its corresponding impact on travel returns in the near term.Historically, Norwegian touted a solid brand intangible asset, allowing the firm to capture better capacity-adjusted yields than its peer set in 2019, at $257 per diem (versus $209 for Royal and $179 for Carnival). We refer to 2019 metrics, as it was the last full year of operation. But Norwegian still falls in the shadow of its sizable peers, Carnival and Royal Caribbean, which have around 90 and 60 ships globally deployed, respectively, versus Norwegian's 31 ships including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. In our opinion, this balance of capacity can force Norwegian to be a price-taker in periods of economic or geopolitical distress in its namesake brand, despite offering its customers a product (freestyle cruising) that differs somewhat from the traditional cruise product. As demand and supply patterns stabilize, we expect pricing gains to normalize. We forecast 3% average yield growth over the next decade, versus 6% average pricing increases over the five years ending 2019. With inconsistent demand and supply patterns in 2021-22 now behind us, as the global cruise industry has redeployed its fleet, we expect Norwegian to surpass 2019 pricing again in 2023. We have long touted the strategic sense of Norwegian's market-to-fill strategy, which is a key factor that resonates with consumers and supports demand. Additionally, longer-term pricing gains could be bound by a lack of new cruisers over the near term if those potential customers opt for more safely perceived land-based vacations, given the media hype (a trend we have yet to see, as Norwegian indicated that one third of its sold-out 2024 world cruise bookings were from new-to-brand guests).Additionally, although there has historically been evidence that a cost advantage has persisted for the sizable operators (for example, over the five years ended 2019, Carnival, Royal, and Norwegian all paid a high-20s level of net cruise costs on SG&A, while Lindblad, with eight owned expedition ships and five seasonal charter vessels at the time, spent more than 50%), this argument has not held true as cruising resumed. Most importantly, scale was lost due to ships that were in layup, as Norwegian executed a staggered return to the sailing of its fleet through May 2022. With uncertainty surrounding long-term deployment and sourcing patterns across the industry (there is no previous proxy to guide us to what this might look like after a full industry stop), we expect there could be dislocation between revenue and items like payroll, food, and fuel, until Norwegian has a more complete picture of how industrywide hardware is geographically allocated longer term (for example, Royal is returning to China in 2024, which could relocate capacity from North America to Asia). Our efficient scale moat source had also been disrupted as a result of COVID-19a key tenet of which was barriers to entry. We had historically been concerned that large ships cost between $500 million and $1 billion, requiring access to liquidity. However, if some of the large operators continue to trim older hardware from their fleet, sold ships could be repurposed for another operator at a significantly less expensive price (in fact, Royal Caribbean's Silversea brand acquired the now-defunct Crystal Cruises Endeavor in July 2022). Furthermore, despite the high costs of entering the industry, some new players are still attempting to tap into the cruiser base as extensions of their existing operating businesses, like Virgin or Ritz-Carlton, potentially increasing the competitive landscape.Adjusted returns on invested capital, including goodwill, first neared our estimated 10% weighted average cost of capital in 2017. However, we believe Norwegian could generate average ROICs including goodwill below our weighted average cost of capital estimate (10%) until 2028, hindered by a significant increase in the invested capital base in response to the fallout stemming from COVID-19. While the customer penetration rates remain low, with a single-digit level of the global population ever having cruised, we believe low switching costs could hinder the growth rate of cruisers.","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High to Norwegian Cruise Line based on the firm's fundamental exposure to the economy and economic cycles, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system. Norwegian faces risks that include geopolitical uncertainty, commodity price volatility, and changes to the U.S. tax code as well as firm-specific issues. Over the last few years, the company has faced headline risk surrounding COVID-19, which has affected its ability to stimulate consistent near-term demand (particularly around the delta and omicron surges). Additionally, if COVID-19 cases surge, or another outbreak occurs, hardware could again operate at lower occupancy levels, hindering profits.Risks to pricing power exist, as the media has clung to negative publicity in prior years, threatening the ability to raise fares, a factor that was agitated with the pandemic. Our concern for the long-term impact around COVID-19 remains tempered, as past viral events have had a transitory impact on cruise pricing. On the positive side, we think it would be difficult for any new competitor to enter the market en masse and take material share from the top operators (Royal Caribbean, Carnival, and Norwegian) due to the structural anomalies of the business. There are a limited shipyards available for new builds and long lead times to take a ship from design to market, which would prevent any new ships from sailing on the seas for at least three years. New market entrants could find it difficult to scale quickly and price competitively.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, Norwegian faces numerous risks, most visibly surrounding product risk with regard to the potential for viral outbreaks. But the firm also faces regulation around pollution (waste water, sulfur) and human capital risks, with a workforce that turns over frequently. Other factors that we believe are less material surround energy, water, and consumer privacy concerns.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Norwegian is Standard. Forecast adjusted returns on invested capital including goodwill (8% on average over the next five years) are set to trail our weighted cost of capital estimate (10%) until 2028. The balance sheet is weak, given the company's high revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. Additionally, two thirds of the company's $14 billion-plus debt load is coming due over the next five years. With a net debt/adjusted EBITDA multiple that fails to fall below 4 times until 2026, there is little financial flexibility on the balance sheet.Frank Del Rio had been CEO since January 2015. Del Rio was previously the president and CEO of Prestige, which was acquired at the end of 2014, and had been successfully leading the business since its inception. With Apollo and Genting closing out its ownership stakes in 2018, the composition of the board of directors has changed and now includes five independent directors out of seven total. However, Del Rio stepped down from his position as president and CEO on June 30, 2023, after eight years at the helm. Del Rio plans to serve as a senior advisor through 2025, which we believe should be a seamless transition. As of July 1, Harry Sommer, previously president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line (or NCL, Norwegian's largest brand), has taken over the CEO seat. With roughly 30 years of industry experience across sales, marketing, revenue management, and business strategy, we think Sommer is well-suited to assume the top spot at Norwegian. During his recent role at Norwegian, Sommer effectively led NCL alongside Del Rio, through the successful relaunch of NCL fleet (after a 500-day pause), introduction of Norwegian Prima (in a brand-new class design), and a robust booking season in 2022. As such, we hold a favorable view on the succession plan, and we don't foresee imminent changes to the firm's strategic direction.Given the return to full deployment, we believe tactical investments are being made (with the firm still cautiously preserving its liquidity position). Generally, the most significant investment has stemmed from the purchase of new ships and refurbishments of the existing fleet.Furthermore, we deem cash distributions as appropriate, with the management team returning capital to shareholders when optimal. As such, it suspended share repurchases early in the COVID-19 cycle. In considering the condition of the balance sheet, we don't expect either repurchases or dividends to take effect anytime soon, as debt paydown will likely take precedence for the use of excess cash. In our model, repurchases and dividends remain nonexistent.","Norwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 66,000), operating 31 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With six passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 16,500 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.","Norwegian has accessed significant liquidity since the beginning of the pandemic, most recently raising $790 million of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 in October 2023. It was also previously able to increase export credit agency commitments on prior contracted new builds to increase the size and amend the fuel consumption (methanol) type. In our opinion, these efforts signal Norwegian's dedication to optimize its balance sheet opportunistically while protecting cash flow. Given that cash demands should largely be covered by advance ticket sales with the fleet fully redeployed, we think liquidity constraints are becoming less worrisome, and that cash on hand (around $680 million as of September 2023) should provide cushion for smooth operating conditions. Although the firm is set to remain cash flow negative until 2024, we expect it to achieve positive EBITDA performance again in 2023.However, when considering the plethora of debt raises since the start of the pandemic, Norwegian is likely to remain above the 2.5-2.75 times net debt/adjusted EBITDA target it had previously sought to achieve. We don't have Norwegian reaching this range until 2027 as it slowly pays down debt and finances new ship purchases, implying a return to investment-grade is a longer term focus. With Norwegian's 31 ships sailing, we expect capacity expansion to support top line growth. We still expect that management will continue to order ships for delivery around every 18 months (and at least one per year in 2025-28) at its namesake brand and will opportunistically finance new ships through compelling pricing in the debt markets or ECA facilities.",NCLH,Consumer Cyclical,6985478656.0,NYQ,20497117.0,USD,14.390000343322754,True,1,16.10776478262353,18.110123504828394,1
25/11/2023,"Yidu Tech Has Potential in Healthcare Big Data, but Operating Losses Becoming a Significant Issue",Yidu Tech Inc,02158,3,17/10/2023,Kai Wang,4.7,HKD,24/11/2023,5.2,High,,Standard,,17/10/2023,"We recently spoke with the management teams of several healthcare companies to get an update on the progress of the anticorruption movement in Chinas healthcare sector to assess how this could affect companies under our coverage for the long term. We believe that this will likely become a long-term driver for companies that provide data-driven studies to facilitate research and drug promotion, such as Medlive and Yidu, as they provide doctors a legitimate medium for them to prescribe medicines that could otherwise be perceived as taking kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies. We believe that the anticorruption movement is likely a positive for the long-term clinical development of drugs and this should provide transparency for hospital policies. As for healthcare e-commerce companies such as JD Health and Alibaba Health, we believe the initiative is likely to have less of an impact on their revenue growth in the long term, as they rely on greater healthcare retail demand. However, we think the policies could provide greater consumer confidence for online retailand we estimate penetration of healthcare e-commerce is low at 5%-10% in China. Even so, we believe that in the short term, there could be demand headwinds. We expect a moratorium on medical associations and healthcare conferences conducting large-scale activitiesgiven that scrutiny is likely high right nowand hospital officials are likely cautious about perceived actions that would put them at risk. Of the companies under our coverage, we believe that Medlive should benefit the most given that the platform services 80% of Chinas 4.4 million doctors and can benefit from a known, successful blueprint from its partnership with M3. The latter owns 36.91% of Medlive and has a leading market share in Japan, which follows similar healthcare marketing laws as those in China, where pharmaceutical companies can only advertise their products to doctors and hospitals. ","Clinical trials in China increased 38% in 2021 and should continue to trend positively, providing tailwinds for Yidu. Digitization of China is expected to spill over into healthcare industry, given lesser competition in healthcare AI and Big Data. Partnerships with hospitals and regulatory bodies should provide validation for Yidu Cloud.","Given medical records do not belong to Yidu, competitors could try to replicate their business model with the same data. The current slowdown in Chinas pharmaceutical industry may affect near-term growth forecasts and force companies to reassess their budgets. The Big Data healthcare industry is still in the nascent phase in China, and it may be too early to tell who the ultimate winners and losers are.",08/09/2023,"Yidu Tech provides AI solutions to hospitals, policymakers, and life science companies using its algorithm, Yiducore, which works by aggregating and converting raw data sets that lie within the IT systems of hospitals in China into structured and standardized data. Its algorithm is embedded in 2.6 billion full-cycle medical records covering 600 million patients from hospitals and provides models from real-world evidence. As more hospitals and disease registries partner with Yidu, Yiducore can process AI solutions more efficiently and accurately as it adds incremental data to its algorithm. As a result, hospitals can use real world-based evidence from the records to determine the best course of action for treatment and drugs for their patients. We think that the rich amount of data from medical records is a barrier entry, and Yidu has built a client base comprising 88 of the top 150 hospitals. In addition, we believe that it is gaining traction commercially with life science companies and expect to see 80% revenue growth year over year in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 (ending March) that will be the basis of its long-term growth. Life science companies can use the medical database, insights, and disease models to increase chances of clinical trial success while shortening the cost and time. There are switching costs as life science companies are unlikely to switch solution provider mid-clinical trial, and should a trial be successful through all four phases, the recurring life span of a contract could potentially last nine years.  However, our main concern is that Yidu has not reached break-even yet in its operating history, operates in a nascent industry with no blueprint, and its current negative operating margin of 58% still suggests that there could be steep hurdles before reaching the milestone. Despite client increases, margin has not improved as operating expenses also increased at a faster pace. We believe that heavy spending is now behind the company and expect operating expenses to stabilize, but without a track record for margin expansion, this will be the key uncertainty for Yidu in the near term and a significant determinant in long-term viability.","We assign a no moat rating to Yidu Tech despite having a proprietary, differentiating artificial intelligence technology that has applications in natural language processing, Big Data restructuring, and cloud computing, which in our view is hard to replicate. However, given current significant negative margins and the lack of historical positive return on invested capital, or ROIC, we believe it is too early to assign the company a moat given its eventual success is still uncertain, although there are positive trends for Yidu that could cause us to upgrade our moat rating in the future. According to Yidus prospectus and Ernst & Young, it is the largest emerging healthcare Big Data specialist with a leading 25% market share and enjoys a significant advantage over its closest competitor with only 7% market share. Yidu competes in this niche of Big Data that includes the use of cloud-based architecture, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We believe its leading market share will be tough to overtake, given our view that its proprietary technology is differentiating. Its algorithm is embedded in 2.6 billion full-cycle medical records covering 600 million patients from hospitals and provides models from real-world evidence. With a large swath of data, hospitals can use real world-based evidence from the records to determine the best course of action for treatment and drugs for their patients. The amount of medical records embedded into Yidu's AI will take time and resources to replicate.Yidu also partners with disease registries and along with its medical records that use Yiducore, life science companies can see their results to set up clinical trials to understand what types of treatments patients best respond to. In addition, the registries can provide information to allow for better patient recruitment targeting when the company wants to find the best testing site during clinical trials. Registries provide insight on populations that may have higher frequencies for certain diseases. As more hospitals partner with Yidu, its algorithm is able to add incremental data to increase the efficiency of its AI algorithm. The model generated by the algorithm considers different scenarios for clinical trials, suggesting the best course of action to cut down time on experimentation. Yiducore was developed by its founders through their experiences from the private sector rather than intellectual property from academic institutions.Despite its differentiating algorithm, we are assigning a no-moat rating due to its current heavy operating losses even though it began to monetize its AI in 2017. Although our midcycle operating margin is 14%, our main concern is that Yidu has not reached breakeven yet in its operating history, operates in a nascent industry with no blueprint, and its current negative operating margin of 58% still suggests that there could be steep hurdles before reaching the milestone. Despite an increase in client numbers, margin has not improved as operating expenses also increased at a faster pace. The company is targeting breakeven in fiscal 2024 but we remain wary about how fast margins can scale up and while our model eventually assumes breakeven for Yidu, we do not see it happening before 2026-27. We expect long-term net margins of 15%, but this can depend on how fast it achieves breakeven. The closer it comes to its breakeven target date of fiscal 2024, the more likelihood we assume in our model that it can reach the long-term margin levels. Revenue per customer in the life science business has increased sharply, which gives us some confidence of per-unit economics that could lead to breakeven in 2026-27, a couple of years beyond its 2024 target. In addition, Yidus operating margin profile is similar to other U.S.-based software companies where sales and marketing expenses are heavy in the initial years due to companies wanting to capture early customer adoption. This is since each customer has a high lifetime value of sticky revenue with high switching costs. If Yidu can begin to show profitability from customer stickiness then we would also consider an upgrade to our moat rating that includes switching costs as a moat source.Yidus algorithm works with both hospitals and regulators as well as commercial life science companies, which highlights its flexibility. For both types of clients, Yiducore aggregates and converts raw data into a standardized format, and clients are divided into two businesses: Big Data platform and solutions, and life science solutions. For hospitals and regulators (or its Big Data platform and solutions business), the algorithm leverages insights from a number of medical records to drive higher-quality and more efficient medical research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment, so that hospitals can provide better service quality and efficiency. Doctors can also use Yiducore to view patient flow and disease trends. As for regulators, Yiducore uses its insights to enhance public health monitoring and regulatory oversight, which leads to better policymaking and implementing population health management initiatives. Yidu works with regulators and hospitals by embedding its algorithm into the private cloud of these institutions. Yidu is the data processor under authorization of hospitals, and no actual database is taken out of hospitals as Chinese law restricts hospitals from releasing medical records to private firms. The Big Data platform business that covers hospitals and regulatory institutions, Yidus initial business, will remain a large part of revenue but we expect it to grow at a slower pace. Revenue growth is expected at only 10% year on year for the next two years, as these institutions prioritize operational efficiency rather than commercial success. For Yidu, however, its goal to partner with the top 150 hospitals in China remains intact, as Yidu has increased its hospital client base each year. Revenue is recognized based on upfront platform development, installation and maintenance fees, and a subscription fee for hospitals and regulators, as well as a per-trial basis for life science companies. Yidu has 88 of the top 150 hospitals in China as its clients, which implies some validation of its solutions, and targeting the rest of the top hospitals remains managements long-term goal in the business. We believe that Yidu has leveraged its success with institutions toward more commercial sectors in healthcare, which should provide the bulk of revenue and growth in the long term. As for the commercial life sciences business, or life sciences solutions, not only is it expected to drive the bulk of revenue growth but also the segment is the biggest factor in our valuation. Yidu processes large data sets from disease registries for medical device and pharmaceutical companies to increase the probability of clinical success with less drug development time and cost. Its clients can use the registry and look at real-world evidence on treatment and symptom patterns of certain diseases and then devise a plan on how to best conduct its trials in terms of testing sites and treatment methods, as well as post-treatment effects. Successful new products from clients should dictate Yidus growth, and tailwinds for Chinas healthcare industry could mean more demand for Yidus services.  The life science segment should make up for most revenue and growth in the long term, given a growing healthcare industry and the increasing demand for greater commercial success, as evidenced by the increasing number of clinical trials for drugs and medical devices. The number of clinical trials conducted in China grew a robust 38% last year and should provide tailwinds for Yidu. Currently, Yidu has 141 clients in its life science business. We expect the client base to increase to more than 800 at the end of our model, which is a small percentage of the total life science companies in China. There are some switching costs that come with this business as well, given that life science companies are unlikely to switch solution provider in the middle of their clinical trials at the risk of inconsistent data, and continued success and progress to the next phase means that clients would continue to use Yidu. The entire life span for a clinical trial could last nine years, as phase 1 contracts generally last one year, phase 2 for two years, and phases 3 and 4 for three years each. Yidus health management platform and solutions resembles Ping An Good Doctors business as it provides insurance options, patient management solutions, and online consultations. Despite using an advanced algorithm to better provide management options for patients, we do not believe that customers will see much differentiation from its offerings from other service providers. Given the lack of differentiation, we assign this segment no moat. Our revenue growth forecast for this business is 43% in fiscal 2023 as it has a small base of paying customers, but we do not expect growth to accelerate in the long term as the industry has heavy competition. The business currently has only 12 million paying customers.","We assign Yidu a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. We believe that execution risk, increasing research and development costs, and lack of positive margin in its history are the biggest potential risks for Yidu.Outside of execution risks, we do not view competition as a major issue for Yidu. Yidu Cloud appears to have traction with major hospitals, given the increasing number of clients and Its algorithm is proprietary, which should provide a moderate barrier to entry. Yidu contracts are also multiyear deals outside of phase 1 clinical trials, which mitigates some of the uncertain timing of cash flows with trials.We think the highest environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk for Yidu is data security, given Yidus algorithm embeds itself into the private clouds of hospitals and regulatory bodies, which are sensitive to patients and medical records. Chinese law prevents medical records from leaving their respective institutions. Yiducore first goes through a de-identification process of all the medical records first in its algorithm, and thus we believe that it adheres to security measures and applicable information protection laws in China. There havent been any major private data security breaches since its incorporation. Hence, we do not believe this to be a material issue for Yidu. ","We assign Yidu a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Standard. Yidu has not engaged in any major acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment, or intangible assets. Our major concern for Yidu is that operating expenses are around 3 times its gross profit. The concern goes back to our investment thesis that cash burn is a concern and could affect valuation. The companys sales and marketing expenses increased over 70% year on year in fiscal 2022, and despite our expectations that initial significant outlays are behind the company, we are keeping an eye on expenses. According to the prospectus, 3% of net proceeds from the IPO will go to R&D, namely data processing technology and machine learning algorithms. Another 35% is expected to go toward business expansion that is related to sales and marketing expenses, 20% is to go to investments and acquisitions, and 10% toward working capital.Outside of high operating expenses, allocation of capital is not an issue. Average capital expenditure for fiscal 2020-22 was CNY 40 million per year. The balance sheet has CNY 3.8 billion in cash and investments, mainly from the IPO, and only CNY 52 million total debt. Fiscal 2022 EBITDA loss was CNY 673 million.","Yidu Tech offers healthcare Big Data. It is an AI cloud-based firm providing solutions and tools to aid in more informed decisions to drive better efficiency in clients' strategies. Its clients are hospitals, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device firms, research institutions, insurance companies, patients, and regulators. It three business segments are: Big Data platform and solutions, which partners with hospitals and policymakers to drive better efficiency; life sciences solutions, which enables better probability of clinical trial success with less drug development time and cost; and health management solutions, which helps with patient management. The Big Data platform accounted for 33% of revenue, life science solutions 30%, and health management solutions 27%, in fiscal 2022.","We do not have any concerns with Yidus financial strength given that the company recently publicly listed and has ample cash. As of fiscal 2022, the balance sheet has CNY 3.8 billion in cash and investments, mainly from its IPO, and only CNY 52 million total debt.Its current net debt/EBITDA ratio is negative due to overall negative EBITDA of CNY 673 million, which implies that the company can go through a 5-6 year cash burn at the current level of EBITDA and cash balance. There are no issues yet with its balance sheet, but continued losses may change our view.",2158.HK,Healthcare,5327420928.0,HKG,10714212.0,HKD,4.760000228881836,True,1,4.245662646120481,4.24629629394321,0
24/11/2023,Fairfax Is Enjoying Some Tailwinds,Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd,FFH,2,03/11/2023,Brett Horn,1249.5,CAD,23/11/2023,970.0,Medium,,Standard,C,03/11/2023,"Fairfax continued its recent string of good results in the third quarter. Book value per share, adjusted for dividends, has grown 16% year to date, which gives an indication of the winds the company has had at its back this year. While we appreciate the positives the company is enjoying right now, its historical performance has been increasingly hit or miss over time, and we dont expect this to change long term. We will maintain our CAD 970 fair value estimate for the no-moat company and see shares as a bit overvalued at the moment. The combined ratio for the quarter came in at 95.0%, compared with 100.3% last year. The improvement was entirely driven by a decline in catastrophe losses. We've seen underwriting margins at peers flattening out in recent quarters, suggesting that the benefits of the hard market may have peaked. Still, underwriting margins are at relatively attractive level compared with Fairfaxs historical levels, which should leave the company in a favorable position in the near term. Fairfax recorded a modest investment gain of $56 million in the quarter, as a $273 million gain on its equity holdings was partially offset by losses on fixed-income investments. We think investors should ignore marks on fixed income, given that insurers generally hold fixed-income securities to maturity. Fairfaxs investment income improved to $513 million from $257 million last year. Fairfax had kept its duration low on its fixed income investments and that is paying off now that interest rates have risen. Based on its commentary, it sounds like the company is shifting to longer-duration securities. We think this is the right move. We see interest rate risk as more balanced now and believe moving toward the more typical industry approach of matching investment and claims duration is therefore appropriate.",Fairfax's large gains during the financial crisis highlight the massive returns Watsa's unorthodox investing style is capable of generating. Recent underwriting improvements set the stage for better overall returns if investment results are strong. Fairfax's international operations give it meaningful exposure to faster-growing markets.,"Fairfax will continue to post poor results and could destroy significant value if Watsa's investment thesis doesn't pan out. Watsa's move toward a bullish investment posture essentially locks in the poor performance Fairfax endured in the post-crisis period. Fairfax historically has not been a strong underwriter, which gives the company a bigger hill to climb on the investment side in order to generate acceptable, let alone excess, returns.",19/10/2023,"While its primary business is insurance, Fairfax is in some ways more of an investment fund. Chairman and CEO Prem Watsa has a long history of bold investment bets and has shown a willingness to be unorthodox when it comes to portfolio construction. As a result, compared with other insurers, the company's results tend to be driven more by results on the investment side. We're somewhat skeptical of this approach, as we believe disciplined underwriting is a more reliable path to long-term value creation for insurers, and Fairfax's underwriting record is relatively poor. We think Fairfax's performance will continue to hinge on whether Watsa's investment theses play out, and the company has pivoted on this front. Fairfax collected a multibillion-dollar windfall during the financial crisis thanks to some large bearish bets but then remained cautious for many years afterward, resulting in weak overall results despite a significant improvement in underwriting performance over time.  However, following the U.S. election of Donald Trump as president, Watsa did an about-face and banked on a strong equity market. Watsas optimism has largely worked to the company's advantage, but it has come with some volatility. As the market turned in 2020, Fairfax went though a period of volatility but finished the year with a modest reduction in book value per share. During 2021, the company's bullish stance was a positive, before becoming a drag again in 2022. This year, management's decision to keep the duration short on its fixed-income portfolio has paid substantial dividends, as the company has been able to shift into higher yield securities relatively quickly. We think investors attracted to the stock due to a belief in Watsas ability to produce alpha should consider his record over the past decade, which includes some big wins but also substantial losses and missed opportunities. Fairfax has seen a lot of ups and downs, but its performance has been trending toward mediocrity.  In the near term, however, strong industry pricing should be a material tailwind for Fairfax and its peers and lead to better underwriting profitability.","In general, insurers do not benefit from favorable competitive positions. Industry competition is fierce and the products are essentially commodities. Furthermore, most participants do not know their cost of goods sold for a number of years, allowing them to underprice policies without knowing it. Firms have a large incentive to chase growth without regard for profitability, a cycle that repeats itself as competitors are forced to match artificially low prices or risk losing business. While Fairfax is a relatively unique player in the industry, we do not believe it has a moat.On the underwriting side, about 75% of Fairfaxs business is primary P&C lines, with the remainder being reinsurance. Within its primary business, it is weighted toward casualty lines. For insurers of this type, moats generally come from a focus on specialty lines, which we define as areas that require extensive experience or unique relationships to underwrite effectively. While Fairfax might have some operations that meet these criteria, its underwriting results historically have been poor, with the company averaging a combined ratio of 97% over the past 10 years. This level is roughly in line with industry averages, suggesting Fairfax, does not have an advantage when it comes to underwriting, which is the key metric in assessing moats in the space, in our view. We believe that Prem Watsas investment philosophy, willingness to make outsize bets, and potential to generate alpha are the primary attractions for many investors. Fairfaxs name is often included in discussions about the mini-Berkshires that seek to distinguish themselves on the investment side, but we think this narrative is misleading. Watsa has had some dramatic successes on the investment side, with the most impactful being his gain of over $3 billion from credit default swaps and equity market hedges during the financial crisis. But he has had notable misses as well, including a sizable investment in Blackberry, and we dont think his record could justify framing his investment skills as a structural competitive advantage. The companys preferred metric is growth in book value per share, which has grown at a 6% CAGR over the past 10 years, a fairly mediocre result even considering the dividends Fairfax has paid. ","Like other insurers, Fairfax's biggest risks are claims in excess of the amount reserved or material losses in its investment portfolio. Due to Watsa's unorthodox style and willingness to make bold moves, the investment side is generally a greater factor relative to other insurers. On the claims side, the company's substantial reinsurance operations create a material amount of risk, and the company has meaningful natural catastrophe exposure. As a result, the company has taken substantial underwriting losses at times, which could create significant issues for the company if they coincided with poor investment results.Some ESG issues for P&C insurers arise in a second-hand fashion, through the industries the insurer serves or investments. For commercial insurers, insuring industries with a high level of ESG risk could draw criticism and potentially lead to lost revenue if the situation becomes untenable. Insurers can also draw criticism on the extent to which the insurer incorporates ESG into its investment decisions. The biggest issue for P&C insurers is climate change, as insurers typically cover weather-related losses, and climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Insurers profitability could be significantly impaired if they do not recognize these risks and adjust their underwriting practices accordingly. ","Our capital allocation rating for Fairfax is Standard. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return track record is mixed.Fairfax is personified by founder, chairman, and CEO Prem Watsa and has largely functioned historically as a platform for him to exercise his investment views. Watsa is zealous about maintaining control over Fairfax, and the company has dual share classes that give the shares he holds outsize voting power. In 2015, Watsa asked shareholders to make adjustments so that the voting power of his shares would not dip below 40% even if the company used shares to make future acquisitions. While we take a dim view of such accommodations, our concerns are somewhat offset by the fact that Watsa does appear to take a true ownership view and agreed to lock his annual compensation at CAD 600,000 through 2025. He has held his personal compensation at this level since 2000.Fairfax is sometimes included in discussions about ""mini-Berkshires"" or companies that attempt to emulate Warren Buffett's success. Management eschews this label, and we would agree it is misleading. There are some similarities, notably Watsa's unique investment style, his long-term value bent, his acquisitions outside the insurance industry, and Fairfax's decentralized operating structure. However, there are important differences as well. Fairfax pays a regular dividend, and Watsa's investment approach is often more than just a long-only value strategy. In our view, the most important consideration is that, unlike Berkshire, Fairfax historically has been a relatively weak underwriter, which gives the company a bigger hill to climb on the investment side in order to generate acceptable, let alone excess, returns.Watsa had a terrific start in the first part of Fairfax's life, generating a 36% CAGR in book value per share from 1985 to 2000. Since then, results have been much more spotty, and book value growth has slowed over time. Management maintains its long-term target of 15% annual book value per share growth, but this looks increasingly unrealistic. The 6% CAGR in book value per share over the past 10 years was weighed down by Watsa's bearish stance during a bull market in recent years. The 9% compound annual growth rate in book value per share over the past 20 years is better but not terribly impressive, and it includes the large investment gains during the financial crisis. The company struggled in the precrisis period due to some bad acquisitions. Without the large investment gains during the crisis, Fairfax's performance over this period would have been consistently value-destructive, in our view. Fairfax historically has been quite acquisitive, and we are somewhat skeptical of its ability to create value through acquisitions. We fail to see a clear and consistent strategy in these acquisitions, besides increasing the company's float. While recent underwriting results have shown improvement, this has been an industrywide phenomenon, and historically Fairfax has underperformed, suggesting it might benefit from greater centralization. But Fairfax has had some successes, and more recent activity has included selling as well as buying, suggesting Watsa has moved past just trying to expand operations.","Fairfax provides reinsurance and property and casualty insurance in Canada, the United States, and other international markets. The company also has some noninsurance operations such as restaurants. Fairfax has been led by Prem Watsa, its chairman and CEO, since its formation in 1985.","Fairfax's balance sheet structure does not deviate dramatically from peers', and equity/assets stood at 17% at the end of 2022. Given the risks the company has historically been willing to take on both the underwriting and investment sides, this structure is arguably a little aggressive. With Fairfax's investment positioning now focused in a bullish direction and its equity hedges removed, we see risk on this side as increased.

24/11/2023,Emera's High-Growth Florida Region Supports Earnings Growth,Emera Inc,EMA,4,10/11/2023,Andrew Bischof,48.32,CAD,23/11/2023,54.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,B,10/11/2023,"We are maintaining our Emera CAD 54 per share value estimate after Emera reported third-quarter operating earnings per share of CAD 0.75 compared with CAD 0.76 in the same year-ago period. Our narrow moat remains unchanged. The company provided its 2024-26 capital investment plan of CAD 8.9 billion, up CAD 500 million from its previous plan. The plan supports approximately 7% rate base growth. Nearly 75% of the capital will be directed toward constructive Florida, focusing on grid hardening and renewable energy. Management sees the potential for CAD 2.3 billion of investment, which could drive 8% rate base growth, in the back half of its plan. Funding the investment plan and Emera's balance sheet will be a focus for investors given the current capital market conditions. The company aims to use asset recycling to fund up to 15% of the capital plan. We think management will look to its regulated gas utilities, particularly in New Mexico, and contracted assets for asset sales. Given the continued strength in the market for smaller utility assets, we like management's decision to seek asset sales. The company also plans to issue up to CAD 300 million in equity. With the stock trading at a 10% discount to our fair value estimate, the sales would be dilutive and have a small fair value impact. Supporting our view of Florida's regulatory constructiveness, the recent outcome at Peoples Gas included a 10.15% allowed return on equity with an allowed equity structure of 54.7%. We expect the company to file a rate case at Tampa Electric, with rates effective in 2025. We expect a similarly constructive outcome. Emera benefited from investments and strong underlying demand at its utilities as well as favorable foreign exchange effects. More than offsetting these benefits were weaker results at its Emera Energy business, as we expected, and share dilution.","The move toward regulated operations drives rate base and earnings growth certainty. Emera earns regulated returns in many different states and provinces, protecting its earnings from the impact of one adverse regulatory ruling. The company's Florida utility operates in a highly constructive regulatory environment with above-average growth opportunities.","The company's aggressive investment plan increases regulatory risk, particularly in Nova Scotia. The company's no-moat energy services unit brings some commodity risk and cash flow uncertainty to its regulated portfolio. As with all utilities, rising interest rates will raise financing costs and could make the dividend less attractive for income investors.",15/08/2023,"Emera has transitioned to a predominantly U.S. utility that generates a majority of its earnings and growth from its Florida operations. While Emera's Canadian utilities have historically operated under a constructive regulatory framework, Emera's U.S. utilities offer significantly more growth opportunities and higher allowed returns. We think Emera made a wise transition away from noncore regulated and unregulated operations and toward investment opportunities at its regulated utilities. We like that management divested its unregulated, no-moat generation unit. We viewed the susceptibility the unit had to volatile commodity prices and capacity prices unfavorably.  Management also completed the sale of its Maine utility, which was regulated but had lower allowed returns and fewer capital investment opportunities and proceeds were used to support regulated investments in more atttractive regions. We don't expect any additional asset sales, although we think management should consider divesting its remaining no-moat asset energy services business.  Emera plans to invest CAD 8.4 billion in 2023-25, supporting 7% to 8% annual rate base growth. This includes lower capital investment at its Nova Scotia Power utility as the company incorporates legislation in Nova Scotia that materially altered the utility's growth and operating cost recovery. The company received regulatory approval for its settlement agreement implementing recent legislation in the province that capped nonfuel rates for 2023 and 2024. While policy development in Nova Scotia is concerning, most of Emera's earnings growth will continue to be driven by its Florida operations, Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas, where the company is directing 75% of its capital investment. The high-growth region continues to need additional capital supported by a very constructive Florida regulatory environment. We expect management will continue to identify additional capital investment opportunities beyond its current plan.","Considering its full suite of businesses, we think Emera has a narrow moat. While historical returns on invested capital are volatile, this has primarily been due to the contribution of Emera's no-moat merchant generation business. With the divestiture of this business, most of Emera's earnings are regulated. This change in business mix gives us confidence that Emera will be able to generate a positive spread between returns on invested capital and its weighted average cost of capital in the short term.For Emera's U.S. regulated utilities, we assign a narrow moat. In Florida, the regulatory environment is very constructive. Tampa Electric's rate case outcome allows for revenue increases and a 9.95% midpoint allowed return on equity. Most of Tampa Electric's revenue comes from residential customers who, as a group, are relatively captive and price-insensitive users of electricity. We remain confident that Tampa Electric will continue to receive top-tier constructive regulatory treatment. We also think the company's smaller New Mexico Gas subsidiary has a narrow moat. We don't think the company's Canadian utility, Nova Scotia Power, has a moat. Recent legislation in Nova Scotia supersedes the regulatory framework and lowers capital investments and limit cost recovery. The unit represents approximately 15% of total 2021 operating earnings, not enough for us to alter our narrow moat rating.Emera's Caribbean utility portfolio also has a narrow moat. While there is additional political risk compared with its North American peers, utilities are granted meaningfully higher allowed returns to compensate for the risk. The cost-of-service model allows for full recovery of fuel through pass-through mechanisms. We view the company's Newfoundland and Labrador transmission projects and Brunswick pipeline as narrow moat assets. Emera's transmission projects offer strong efficient scale advantages. Capital costs for competing transmission systems would be too high to offer sufficient returns on capital for new entrants. Service territory monopolies and efficient scale advantages are the primary sources of an economic moat for regulated utilities such as Emera. Regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks. In exchange for regulated utilities' service territory monopolies, regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow regulated utilities to achieve at least their costs of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing. Intuitively, utilities should have an economic moat based on efficient scale, but in some cases regulation offsets this advantage, preventing excess returns on capital. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions precludes regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moats to many regulated utilities.","We rate Emera with a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.Emera's key risk to future earnings is regulatory uncertainty. The company faces regulatory risks that create uncertainties around costs and allowed returns, especially given the significant capital investment plan through 2027. Emera's regulatory exposure is diversified due to its operations across North America and its federally regulated transmission projects. Additionally Emera is exposed to political and economic instability at its Caribbean operations.Unlike its pure U.S. peers, Emera's results are affected by exchange-rate fluctuations. Over two thirds of the company's earnings are attributed to the U.S. Earnings will be subject to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. The company also faces political risk in Nova Scotia.Emera faces ESG risk. Across its jurisdictions, regulators and politicians are embracing tighter policies on carbon emissions and greater restrictions on coal generation. Emera is addressing this risk through its base capital investment program, planned coal retirements, and investment in renewable energy.Renewable energy is expected to increase to approximately 30% of Emera's generation by 2025, reducing its coal generation by 80%. This will also help Emera achieve its goals of 55% carbon emissions reduction by 2025 from 2005 levels, 80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero emissions by 2050. Regulators in Emera's jurisdictions are supporting this transition.As with all regulated utilities, Emera faces the risk of an inflationary environment that would raise borrowing costs and make other investments more attractive for income-seeking investors.","We assign Emera a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessment of Emera's balance sheet strength, management's investment decisions, and plans to return capital to shareholders. Emera's dividend payout ratio has been higher than its peers but is supported by the company's high-quality and relatively stable regulated assets. Management's 4% to 5% annual dividend growth expectations are below our earnings growth forecast but will help it eventually achieve its 70% to 75% payout ratio target, more in line with that of its peers. We expect Emera to be above its 70% to 75% target payout ratio throughout our forecast.We expect the balance sheet to remain sound with the company maintaining its balance sheet in line with its regulatory requirements, supported by the company's low revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. We expect the company's investment strategy to focus on growing assets through regulated investments, which we think is a reasonable approach.Strong corporate governance, constructive regulatory relationships at its U.S. operations, and sound leadership support our rating. We like that management has moved away from no-moat merchant assets and added assets with steady, predictable cash flows. Management's next test is managing political and regulatory headwinds in Nova Scotia.Scott Balfour, who had been chief operating officer and chief financial officer since joining Emera, took the helm in 2018. We like his moves to sell assets to fund equity needs for its capital plan, and we particularly like his decision to sell the no-moat, unregulated Northeast generation unit. We also like the divestiture of its Maine subsidiary, as it lacked the growth potential and had less constructive regulation than some of its other subsidiaries. He has proved to be a strong leader, and Emera's focus on regulated operations, implementing growth projects, and managing operating expenses has benefited shareholders.","Emera is a geographically diverse energy and services company investing in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution as well as gas transmission and utility energy services. Emera has operations throughout North America and the Caribbean countries.","We forecast Emera will invest roughly CAD 8.4 billion of capital through 2025, so we expect it will be a frequent debt issuer at its regulated utilities.The company has manageable long-term debt maturities, and we anticipate that it will be able to refinance its debt as it comes due. We expect total debt/EBITDA to remain around 6 times.Emera has higher leverage than its regulated-only peers. We expect this ratio to gradually decline through our forecast as Emera deleverages. Emera has ample cash liquidity and borrowing capacity available under its master revolving credit facility. Emera has one of the higher payout ratios in the industry, but its current liquidity should support the dividend payout and capital investment plan. However, we expect dividend growth will be lower than earnings growth, at 4% annually through our five-year outlook. We expect Emera to be above its 70% to 75% target payout ratio throughout our forecast.",EMA.TO,Utilities,13272727552.0,TOR,1232861.0,CAD,48.34999847412109,True,1,47.94335524241072,48.312252975090246,0
24/11/2023,Datadog Stands to Gain as Cloud Migrations and Transformations Provide Tailwinds for Its Solutions,Datadog Inc,DDOG,3,07/11/2023,Malik Khan,112.13,USD,23/11/2023,115.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,B,07/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $115 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Datadog after the firm reported robust financial results for the third quarter of 2023. The positive impact of these results was tempered by our lowering of aggressive long-term growth estimates, leading to our fair value estimate remaining unchanged. On the macro front, management commentary on demand stabilization indicated that the brunt of cloud optimization, which has negatively impacted Datadog's financials, may be in the rearview mirror. As a company that operates on a consumption-based model, Datadog is susceptible to optimization as customers can decrease their spend on Datadog swiftly as they tighten their own fiscal belts. Encouragingly, Datadog saw usage trends improve sequentially in the third quarter and remain strong in the first month of the ongoing fourth quarter. We view these trends as a good omen for the firm and are still modeling strong revenue growth in fiscal 2024 as demand normalization continues. We believe this commentary, coupled with strong financial results, pleased investors and drove shares to jump sharply intraday. Datadog's shares now trade in the 3-star range, and we view them as fairly valued. Datadog's sales for the third quarter clocked in at $548 million, up 25% year over year and above management's high end of guidance. The top-line strength was spearheaded by a healthy mix of both landing new clients as well as expanding spend from existing ones. The firm reported a record number of new customer deals with a value exceeding $100,000 per year. On the upselling front, Datadog continued to grow existing customers with 46% of its customers using four or more Datadog modules, up from 40% a year ago. We believe multi-module vendors, such as Datadog, stand to win in the long term, as customers increasingly switch to platforms that can serve a variety of their IT needs versus onboarding vendors that offer point solutions.","Datadog has strong secular tailwinds behind its back as the FSMA market is expected to grow rapidly. Datadog's additional products, including its more recent security offerings, can offer different points of entry into potential clients' IT ecosystems. Datadog has focused primarily on small- and medium-sized clients. We see a big enterprise opportunity for the firm.","Datadog's product portfolio currently lacks the comprehensiveness of Splunk's platform, leading to lost sales when the two go head-to-head in the enterprise space. There is uncertainty around when Datadog will achieve GAAP profitability; investors should be aware of this when committing capital to the name. Datadog's penetration in the enterprise market lags some of its peers.",08/08/2023,"We believe Datadog is poised for success in the observability space. Datadog's observability platform benefits from secular tailwinds driving an exponential increase in machine data for companies to monitor and analyze. In our view, the firm's sticky product portfolio, combined with a broad range of capabilities, has helped Datadog build a narrow economic moat around its business. We expect machine data to become more pervasive, impacting every part of a business' operations. This increase, driven by cloud migrations and digital transformations, provides the firm with a long runway for growth. As companies generate more data, monitoring becomes vital. From preventing server outages to triaging security threats, Datadog's monitoring platform allows companies to analyze their entire IT stack from one consolidated platform. While the observability space remains competitive, we think Datadog's strategy of investing heavily in its sales and research divisions is sound. In doing so, the firm can maximize its value to its customers that it can land and subsequently expand. The firm has also augmented its organically developed technologies with acquisitions. We view these additions as value accretive as they drive further customer adoption and retention. We are also encouraged by Datadog's emphasis on multi-product sales. We view additional module adoption as an indication of further entrenchment into the client's ecosystem, leading to a higher client lifetime value. There is evidence of this strategy's success in the firm's strong net retention rate north of 130%. With the ability to consistently land customers and upsell them, we view Datadog as having strong long-term growth prospects. ","We believe Datadog merits a narrow moat rating owing to strong customer switching costs associated with its product portfolio. In brief terms, Datadog offers its customers a platform that can ingest, index, and analyze copious amounts of data while providing real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities. From a customer's perspective, using Datadog to monitor its entire IT stack allows it to create better business outcomes due to greater IT- and operations-related efficiencies. With impressive upselling and retention metrics, a suite of inherently sticky product offerings, and a long runway for growth, we believe Datadog is more than likely to generate excess returns over the next 10 years and, therefore, merits an economic moat.We consider Datadog a key competitor in the full-stack monitoring & analytics (FSMA) space. Full-stack monitoring, or Observability, is a rapidly growing space. Modern-day clients leverage technology in their operations like never before. This increased use of technology relies on two of the most prominent secular tailwinds in the software space: cloud migration and digital transformation. However, with an increase in technology comes the coalescence problem, as various services within a company's IT stack may not communicate with another, leading to data blind spots.Full-stack monitoring is a method of unifying and coalescing disparate parts of an enterprise's monitoring framework. FSMA providers seek to give enterprises a one-stop-shop to monitor their entire IT stack, ranging from application performance to the end-user experience. An essential criterion within the FSMA space is a provider's ability to ingest large amounts of data, consolidate it, and then make meaningful inferences from it, leading to better business outcomes. The status quo before the emergence of FSMA was various providers focusing on specific parts of the IT stack. For example, an enterprise may have had one company monitor its application performance while another monitored its logs. Naturally, this division of labor led to inefficiencies as IT professionals coalesced the outputs manually to construct a meaningful picture of the overall infrastructure's health and performance. FSMA providers are now offering customers the ability to remove these data silos and monitor the entire IT stack from one consolidated platform.As mentioned above, the two key secular trends driving the robust growth in the full-stack monitoring space are cloud migrations and digital transformations. In brief, both trends lead to exponentially more data for the companies undergoing these changes. Often, this additional data is machine-generated in the form of metrics, logs, and traces that have to be monitored and observed. Enter FSMA vendors that allow firms to monitor their IT stacks and glean meaningful insights from them to provide better business outcomes. After a company adopts an FSMA vendor, it is vital to understand the costs of ripping and replacing an FSMA vendor. First, it is worth noting that firms often use an FSMA vendor to ""standardize"" their monitoring frameworks. This standardization includes deep integration of the vendor's product into its IT stack. This integration, which ranges from incorporating the vendor's code into the company's applications to developer training, leads to increased switching costs for the FSMA vendor's platform. While single sourcing can create obvious vendor lock-ins, we believe that by doing so, companies can capture efficiencies by allowing their developers to focus on mastering one vendor's product portfolio.Second, we believe IT decisions in a company are driven by its engineers, not its accountants. We do not think that companies nickel and dime their way to picking an FSMA vendor--typically, companies will select the product based on the features most relevant to them. As a result, if an FSMA vendor can demonstrate its portfolio's value to a firm's developers and get them accustomed to its platform by incorporating itself into their day-to-day workflows, its platform can be very sticky within an organization after that.Third, ripping and replacing an FSMA vendor can lead to data loss and security lapses. This risk is a genuine concern for firms using a vendor to monitor their entire IT stack. While competitors may offer a parallel migration that allows these concerns to be somewhat allayed, we do not see companies switching away from their FSMA vendors due to the risk of exposing or losing mission-critical data.Datadog, as an FSMA vendor, seeks to solve complexity arising from monitoring a business' IT stack. By offering products that range from application performance, network, and cloud security monitoring, Datadog is able to provide value to its customers by allowing them to capture efficiencies and save IT labor hours. Datadog has also done a good job of introducing new modules and capabilities that enable the firm to augment its existing offering and, as a result, upsell existing customers. We see evidence of this upselling activity in the firm's solid same-customer revenue expansion metrics as well as its strong net retention rate. Further, as Datadog monitors a client's IT stack, it can glean insights from it that it can then use to improve its services. This iterative process can allow Datadog's product portfolio to naturally improve to better accommodate a client's business needs.A pertinent case study, provided by the company's management, of how businesses can utilize Datadog's platform is one of Seven.One Entertainment, one of Germany's leading multi-channel entertainment companies. By incorporating Datadog's monitoring tool into its IT stack, Seven.One's development operations (DevOps) team was able to trace the entire user experience, solve bottlenecks within its IT stack, and detect anomalies quickly. All in all, the company recorded a 78% cost reduction by adopting Datadog's APM module versus the prior solution. By either helping companies cut costs or reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), FSMA vendors like Datadog seek to minimize a client's payback period (or conversely maximize a client's ROI).When thinking about Datadog's competitive landscape and positioning, we view the firm's economic moat as a result of strong switching costs, which can be traced to Datadog's entrenchment in a client's IT stack.We consider Datadog a leader in the full-stack monitoring space, with the firm's application performance monitoring product an area of particular strength. Generally, we view the full-stack monitoring space as one conducive to the presence of economic moats. Datadog's platform adapts to a customer's specific needs and can iteratively improve itself. As a company adopts Datadog's FSMA offerings, we typically see a movement along the upselling schedule as Datadog is able to grow its impact within the company. Datadog's platform adapts to a customer's specific needs and can iteratively improve itself. This process is a multi-step game. Each successful step entrenches Datadog's offerings even more as technical users become more accustomed to the monitoring platform that continues to improve. We see no greater evidence of this entrenchment than the firm's best-in-class net and gross retention metrics, well above 130% and 95%, respectively, since the company's IPO in 2019.Further, Datadog has successfully driven a multi-product strategy, enabling greater entrenchment in a firm's IT stack. With enterprise and midmarket segments growing at a healthy clip, we expect the firm's land-and-expand model to reap the rewards as larger businesses often are prime candidates for a multi-product strategy. We view Datadog's ability to retain and upsell existing customers as evidence of the stickiness of its products, thereby creating switching costs.Datadog's go-to-market strategy aims to land customers across market segments. Obviously, the IT needs of customers of different sizes vary greatly, with enterprise customers wanting a product with many features that'd be redundant to smaller users. We think Datadog's sweet spot thus far has been in the mid-market segment. Deals within the mid-market segment, typically of annual contract values (ACVs) above $100,000, have been growing rapidly for the firm. Success within this segment also speaks to a versatile product portfolio that can accommodate varying needs of businesses, big and small. While the firm has larger clients (typically seen as clients with ACVs above $1 million), its penetration within the enterprise market is lower than its competitor, Splunk. At the same time, we think that a sizable chunk of the market is still greenfield. This opportunity can allow Datadog to land larger clients without having to displace Splunk's well-entrenched enterprise solution. Overall, we think that the competitive landscape is broad enough to accommodate multiple winners.","We assign Datadog a Very High Uncertainty Rating due to execution risk and its place in a competitive high-growth market.We view Splunk as a leader in the enterprise FSMA space. While there are plenty of greenfield opportunities that will allow Datadog to continue to grow, we suspect stiff competition from Splunk as Datadog moves upmarket. As a general rule, enterprise clients are the gold standard for SaaS companies. Their annual contract values, or ACVs, are typically in the millions of dollars, and they are stickier than smaller clients. With that in mind, we anticipate Datadog to compete more rigorously in the enterprise space currently dominated by Splunk. However, with that competition comes execution and competition risk. While we view the FSMA market as broad enough to accommodate multiple winners, the added uncertainty these risks bring results in our very high uncertainty rating.Much like its peers, Datadog invests heavily in its sales and research departments. While we firmly believe in Datadog's long-term opportunity, we think that to bask in the light at the end of the tunnel, Datadog will have to execute well for years to come.We do not see any material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues for Datadog. While Datadog handles mission-critical data, the data itself is typically housed in the client's cloud/data center. A breach could potentially raise legal issues, but we do not see Datadog as particularly exposed to data privacy risks.","We assign Datadog a Standard capital allocation rating based on its sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.We think Datadog's balance sheet is in good shape. With strong cash flow generation, we are not overly concerned by the firm's use of debt. Further, we think that the stickiness of the firm's product portfolio reduces downside risk in the event of an economic downturn. We do not foresee clients slashing their FSMA budgets, irrespective of the economic conditions. This downside protection will enable the firm to maintain a healthy balance sheet in the future.Datadog's investment strategy is double-pronged. First, the firm has invested significant capital in developing organic solutions that enhance its product portfolio. Second, the firm has augmented its portfolio with selective acquisitions. This build-and-buy strategy maximizes return as Datadog can continually improve its platform. We think this strategy is of great importance in the enterprise space. Enterprise clients typically put a premium on the comprehensiveness of a vendor's offerings as added breadth in a vendor's offerings allows for more efficient solutions. We think Datadog will continue to improve its capabilities via organic and inorganic investments.Since Datadog is in a high growth phase, the company does not pay its shareholders a dividend and has stayed away from share repurchases. We see this strategy as appropriate given the firm's bright growth prospects.","Datadog is a cloud-native company that focuses on analyzing machine data. The firm's product portfolio, delivered as software-as-a-service, allows a client to monitor and analyze its entire IT infrastructure. Datadog's platform can ingest and analyze large amounts of machine-generated data in real time, allowing clients to utilize it for a variety of different applications throughout their businesses.","We believe Datadog's financial position is healthy. Datadog ended fiscal 2022 with around $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. While the firm has taken on more debt recently, we believe Datadog's cash generation over our explicit forecast will far outstrip its commitments over the same period.While the firm has not posted GAAP profitability consistently yet, Datadog's FCFE (free cash flow to equity) margins have been in the black for the past four years. We expect the firm to generate strong FCFE margins in the future as it can increase its operating leverage by toning down some of its research and sales expenditures.Going forward, we do not expect to see a material change in Datadog's capital structure. We expect the firm to raise capital by either issuing more equity or taking advantage of low interest rates and issuing debt.",DDOG,Technology,38979600384.0,NMS,3584923.0,USD,112.12999725341795,True,0,94.6805885763706,123.63641922562101,1
24/11/2023,Only Slightly Changing Fair Value for Cullen/Frost as Deposit Base Remains Intact,Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc,CFR,4,22/11/2023,Eric Compton,98.65,USD,23/11/2023,122.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,C,22/11/2023,"We will discontinue analyst coverage of Cullen/Frost Bankers on or about Dec. 13, 2023. We provide analyst research and ratings on over 1,500 companies globally and periodically adjust our coverage according to investor interest and staffing.","A strong economy and higher rates are generally positives for the banking sector relative to a zero rate regime. Texas is also one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. Outsize organic expansion efforts seem to be grabbing additional market share for Cullen/Frost, which should lead to above market revenue growth for years to come. Cullen/Frost has excellent management and a very consistent culture, and it does not sacrifice underwriting standards to achieve growth, items which can be hard to replicate. You can ""sleep well at night"" when it comes to the bank's risk management.","There are few positive catalysts left for the banks. Funding costs are running higher, net interest income has likely peaked, higher regulatory scrutiny is likely, and a potential recession may be around the corner. The current inflationary environment and ongoing organic expansion efforts make Cullen/Frost's expense base difficult to predict, and there could be higher expense growth than investors expect. Cullen/Frost's stringent credit standards have sometimes limited growth opportunities, and the bank doesn't have the scale of its larger competitors that have a national presence. ",26/06/2023,"Cullen/Frost is one of the smaller regional U.S. banks we cover, and it focuses exclusively on the Texas market. The bank is the largest Texas-based bank and prides itself on knowing the Texas market better than anyone else. It has implemented a relationship-based approach to banking that has garnered strong loyalty in its customer base. The bank's sweet spot is small to medium sized Texas based commercial clients. We think that the relationships Cullen/Frost has built up, often times over generations, along with the banks consistent approach to conservative underwriting will continue to serve it well for years to come.  The great strength of Cullen/Frost's approach is the strict adherence to its long-term strategy to attract high-quality borrowers and retain them with uniquely personal service. The bank often says that it doesnt bank industries or businesses, it banks people. Tight relationships provide the bank with insight into the Texas environment that it can leverage to advise all clients and deepen its business relationships. The bank also has a history of surviving when other banks have failed, such as during the S&L and energy crises of the 1980s that led to the demise, through bankruptcy or acquisition, of every other top-10 Texas bank during that period. In addition, Frost exited retail mortgage lending in 2000. As a result, it was one of the first banks in the U.S. to turn down Troubled Asset Relief Program funds during the financial crisis. The bank has also navigated energy downturns in 2016 and again during the pandemic, despite having 100% Texas exposure and one of the higher energy exposures under our coverage. The story of Cullen/Frost is nothing if not of consistency. We like the bank's current organic expansion efforts, first in Houston and more recently in Dallas, and we believe these efforts will add value over time, both through higher growth and, eventually, profitability. The bank's valuation will depend on how much growth these efforts produce and particularly around how expenses develop over the next several years. Interest rates remain a key influencer of revenue, and we see the bank handling the current industry pressure just fine.","We assign Cullen/Frost has a narrow Morningstar economic moat rating as it possesses maintainable cost advantages and switching costs that are consistent with our bank moat framework. While Cullen/Frosts business model does have heavy interest rate exposure, as the majority of the banks loans are floating rate loans, the bank has proven that even within a low interest rate environment it can earn excess returns on tangible equity, and in more constructive rate environments, returns only get better. We believe the banks superior deposit costs, business relationships, pristine underwriting quality, and above average operating efficiency on a tax equivalent basis all support a strong narrow moat for the firm, and we are confident that returns will exceed the banks 9% cost of equity. We argue that bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. We see cost advantages as stemming from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting, with regulatory costs being a final factor that must also be considered. Cullen/Frost has a unique business model as it primarily focuses on commercial banking, and the bank is a Texas bank through and through, with all its business coming from the state. The focus on deep relationship commercial banking, along with a decent number of non-interest-bearing retail deposits means that the bank has one of the highest proportions of non-interest-bearing deposits under our coverage. While earnings credit rates, or ECRs, can offset some of this benefit, the combination of ECRs, which are lower than comparable interest costs on interest-bearing deposits, along with a significant proportion of non-interest-bearing retail deposits, gives the bank a funding advantage. We also believe the ability to determine deposit pricing within the context of a complete business relationship leads to further cost advantages. While deep relationships can help from a deposit cost standpoint, it also helps the bank to develop more profitable relationships with clients who use more of the banks services, and we believe Cullen/Frost does a good job of this as well. The bank remains focused on its core, middle market to small business client base, with loans sized at less than $10 million. Relationships with these smaller companies, which have often been built up over decades, lead to more profitability and maintainable switching costs. Cullen/Frost is perhaps one of the best examples under our coverage of a relationship based bank, and we believe the cultural focus on this pervades the entire organization.Along with deposit cost advantages. The bank has one of the more impressive underwriting histories we have seen, leading to credit cost advantages over time as well. The bank has survived in environments where other banks have failed, including the Great Depression, the banking and energy crises of the 1980s, and most recently the financial crisis. The bank consistently has better credit metrics than peers and spends less of its interest income on provisioning. We believe the culture, institutional knowledge base, and overall relationships that lead to these credit cost advantages are fully ingrained throughout Cullen/Frost and are likely to continue.Cullen/Frost also operates a fairly efficient operation, and after adjusting interest yields to a tax equivalent basis (the bank has a sizable municipal bond portfolio), the bank has fairly consistently operated in the sub-60s for the past decade in spite of different periods of low interest rates environment. While the early stages of organic expansion efforts tend to be front loaded with expenses and then produce revenue over time, with rates set to rise again, we see the bank easily clearing the 60% efficiency ratio hurdle over time and remaining a solid operator from an efficiency standpoint. From a systemic standpoint, we believe the U.S. offers a fair but improving banking environment. Regulation has become considerably stronger in the past several years, and capital levels have never been higher, although the country still uses a complex and somewhat archaic system of regulation. Furthermore, the U.S. banking market is quite fragmented; Cullen/Frost must compete with a variety of regional and community banks as well as large money center institutions. Our outlook is relatively positive from a macroeconomic and political standpoint. The U.S. is still the world's leading democracy, has increased GDP at a steady pace for years, and maintains the world's reserve currency, all of which contribute to banking stability.Cullen/Frost is not large enough to be considered a global systemically important bank and therefore avoids some of the more onerous regulatory capital requirements. The bank is also small enough to avoid the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR and DFAST exams, and the bank is also not subject to any of the LCR or modified LCR requirements. ","Cullen/Frost is a Texas-based bank that focuses exclusively on Texas. As a result, the overall health of the Texas economy is a risk for the bank. This also exposes the bank to the energy industry, both in the south, and with the banks acquisition of Western National, a higher exposure within the Permian basis as well. The bank has high underwriting standards, but a prolonged downturn of the states economy might affect even high-quality borrowers. Management has stated that it plans to reduce the overall energy exposure over time, and this has happened. We previously saw all these risks as manageable, and we see future risks receding even further.Cullen/Frost will also remain exposed to the interest rate cycle, which, like credit and debt cycles, is out of managements control. The bank's larger proportional focus on commercial clients and therefore adjustable rate loans can increase rate sensitivity for banks like Cullen/Frost. From an ESG perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors that can come under more scrutiny at times, like gun manufacturers, or energy, for example. Commercial banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint, and governance practices are in line with most companies.We typically assign our U.S. regional banks a Medium Uncertainty Rating. However, due to heightened deposit base, funding cost, and regulatory uncertainty, we have raised our Uncertainty Rating for Cullen/Frost to High.","We give Cullen/Frost an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are exemplary, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. Cullen/Frost currently has a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2% as of March 2023, far above most comparable peers, and we view the bank's risk profile and capital levels as appropriate, if not conservative. We view the company's capital investments as exemplary, as Cullen/Frost has consistently avoided investing capital in value destroying products, such as GFC era MBS, or through bad lending, while simultaneously pursuing value adding acquisitions and organic growth. Over many decades, Cullen/Frost has survived and even thrived when other banks invested in poor risk taking and eventually paid the price. Cullen/Frost doesn't often pursue acquisitions, but its selective approach has produced several solid additions to the franchise, and the bank's current focus is on organic growth and internal investments. We think this is the right approach and will create value for shareholders and the franchise over time. We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate. Cullen/Frost has one of the higher dividend payout ratios among our coverage, tending to be 40% or more over time, which we think is completely reasonable. We also view the bank's focus on internal investment and organic growth positively.CEO Phil Green assumed the role in March 2016, after more than three decades with the bank. Former CEO Dick Evans was the first nonmember of the founding Frost family to lead the company, but his more than four decades with Frost Bank and nearly two decades as its leader are typical of the continuity we expect to see in the future, and Green follows this pattern. Risk aversion has been the main tenet of the banks strategy over the years, and the bank has performed exceptionally well within some of the toughest banking environments over the last 100-plus years. This includes surviving the Great Depression, the numerous banking failures of the 1980s, and the financial crisis and latest energy downturn. As an example, in 2000, the bank turned away from residential mortgage lending, which put it in the position to turn down TARP funds in 2008 (making the bank the first to publicly turn down TARP funding). These major lessons continue to influence management's strategy and capital decisions, and this is no surprise given the long average tenure of the board of directors.We believe managements overall conservatism, its focus on relationship banking, and the bank's ""square deal"" approach has put the bank in a position to produce very maintainable profits through the cycle. Frost's net charge-offs remained well below 1% of loans during the financial crisis, which placed the bank in the top tier of major banks in Texas by this measure, and the bank consistently has lower proportions of its net interest income eaten up by provisioning costs. The bank's focus on delivering value to customers remains strong and creates significant customer loyalty.Green's latest moves of moderate branch expansion, first in Houston and now in Dallas, a refocus on core small business clients, and attempts to modernize and grow the retail client base all appear sound to us. The bank recently launched its own retail mortgage product, which we expect to help drive incremental future growth. We also like his unwillingness to alter loan structures, even as competitors have done so, showing that the bank's conservatism remains resolute.In our opinion, Cullen/Frosts management team has shown that it possesses the expertise to continue to increase shareholder value over time. Its ability to withstand multiple crises, consistently best in class underwriting practices, strong business relationships that can span generations, and persistence in avoiding banking fads are exceptional traits that cause us to award an Exemplary rating.","Cullen/Frost Bankers is a financial holding company, headquartered in San Antonio. One of the 50 largest U.S. banks, Frost provides a wide range of banking, investments, and insurance services to businesses and individuals across Texas in the Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley, and San Antonio regions.","We believe Cullen/Frost is in very good financial health. The bank has one of the highest common equity Tier 1 ratios under our coverage at 13.2%, as of March 2023. Cullen/Frost also has more than twice as many deposits on the books as it does loans, which indicates an exceptionally strong liquidity position. Furthermore, since total deposits usually make up more than 90% of overall liabilities, the bank has very little need of outside debt and tends to be free of wholesale funding. The run-rate of debt to total assets is generally under 1%. While capital adequacy has been an area of increased debate recently, we do not have concerns about capital for Cullen/Frost. The bank is one of the most conservatively run under our coverage. While there is some uncertainty around future regulatory changes, the bank already has a CET1 ratio, even including AOCI, that easily exceeds its 7% minimum. Further, we would expect any material regulatory changes to be gradually phased in, with nothing material likely to be required until the end of 2024 at the earliest. Cullen/Frost is also under the $100 billion asset threshold that regulators seem to be considering for the most stringent regulatory changes. Finally, while Cullen/Frost has one of the higher CRE exposures among our coverage, we still view the exposure levels as reasonable, and the bank should easily have more than enough earnings and capital to absorb future losses.Overall, we expect the bank to look for ways to deploy its excess capital, primarily hoping for organic growth, with a decent dividend payout ratio hovering around 40% also at play. The bank tends to be fairly selective with stock buybacks.",CFR,Financial Services,6542421504.0,NYQ,460680.0,USD,98.6500015258789,True,1,93.59411235136236,105.20416269184445,1
24/11/2023,"General Dynamics' Moaty Portfolio Delivers in the Air, Land, and Sea",General Dynamics Corp,GD,3,,Nicolas Owens,247.33,USD,23/11/2023,252.0,Low,Wide,Exemplary,A,,No Text Available,"General Dynamics Gulfstream franchise has top-tier volume share and margin in the large end of the business jet market and has successfully transitioned to new G500, G600, and G650 models. Business jets are in high demand as the pandemic wanes. General Dynamics' marine segment has decades of revenue visibility, thanks to the long-cycle nature of shipbuilding. Defense prime contractors operate in an acyclical business, which could offer some protection if the U.S. were to enter a recession.","General Dynamics depends on U.S. military funding, which is an inherently political and thus uncertain process. General Dynamics' C5ISR, ground vehicles, and IT services exposures are somewhat shorter-cycle offerings relative to big-ticket defense procurement items like submarines. Investors looking for double-digit growth of revenue or earnings should look elsewhere as defense spending over the long haul is mature and stable.",07/11/2023,"Regulated margins, mature markets, customer-paid research and development, and long-term revenue visibility allow the defense contractors to deliver a lot of cash to shareholders, which we view positively because we dont see substantial growth in this industry. Indeed, defense budgets usually ebb and flow with a nation's wealth and its perception of danger. In the U.S., both have been on the rise, and among many allies, notably Germany and Japan, geopolitics is leading to larger military budgets than we've seen for decades. For perspective, we estimate that the portions of the U.S. defense budget relevant to contractors like General Dynamics and its competitors and subcontractors shrank between 2011 and 2016 by 3.7% annualized while these budgets grew between 2016 and 2021 by 6.5% annualized. We think the contracting budget will continue to grow with modernization, but more moderately, averaging around 2.5%-3.0% over the next five years. General Dynamics' defense portfolio is mostly dialed in for low single digit growth for the foreseeable future, with some business lines, including submarines, slated to offer slightly faster growth. In all these businesses, the goal for General Dynamics is to execute on delivering and working out more efficient processes to gain incremental profitability, which the company has a strong track record of achieving. General Dynamics Gulfstream segment primarily produces long-range wide-cabin business jets. This market is low volume, with fewer than 200 global deliveries each year and many repeat customers. New, quality product drives demand in this segment, so the company must continuously convince customers that it has built a better aircraft. Gulfstream dominates volume in this segment, with roughly 50% market share, which leads to superior margins as it progresses along the learning curve. We anticipate the introduction of the G700, G800, and G400 in 2022, 2023, and 2025, respectively will be major sales drivers.","The durability of economic profits in the defense sector may seem paradoxical: defense contractors invest the billions to generate products on the cutting edge of technology, and unit pricing for their products declines over time. What's more, these companies primarily sell to a single buyer (referred to as a monopsony in economic texts, in this case the defense and procurement arms of the U.S. government)one with rapidly evolving needs, a tendency to change product requirements, and intermittent squabbles over the bill. Despite these challenges, we observe that wide moats are prevalent in the defense business. They exist because of significant intangible assets: first among these is the extreme product complexity that thwarts new entrants, bolstered by decades-long product cycles, contract structures that reduce risk for the contractor and lock out alternative suppliers, as well as the switching costs of a risk-averse customer facing significant time and risk to potentially switch products. We believe that intangible assets in the defense industry ensure that incumbent firms are the only companies capable of servicing the militarys large need to purchase arms (broadly defined), which manifests as a material barrier to entry. In terms of keeping competition at bay, we believe the primary source of intangible assets is product complexity. First, the technology used in arms production requires extensive and specialized expertise that also usually lacks commercial viability outside of the defense industry (aside from commercial aerospace manufacturing), so a new entrant would likely need to develop this know-how entirely from the ground up and we observe only a few capable incumbents in each major category of defense systems development. Second, the development of a military program is long and expensive; a would-be competitor would face material sunk costs ranging from the challenge of developing a workforce that has the required experience and/or security clearances to enter the space to the time and money spent developing a prototype to pitch for a contract. We note that the only serious outside threat to a small subsegment of this business, space launches, are the pet projects of multibillionaires. We use the Stockholm International Peace Research Institutes data set on the arms industry as evidence that the arms production industry is insulated from outside competition: Lockheed Martin, along with Boeings defense unit, BAE Systems, RTX, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, and General Dynamics have remained the top six or seven global arms producers for the past 15 years (a Chinese state-owned enterprise is the seventh in some of those years).The second major intangible asset in the defense industry is the contract structure that allows excess return generation. Generally, defense prime contractors compete fiercely within initial bidding rounds to win contracts to design and develop a prototype for a new program. The government then usually selects one or more of the winning prototype bidders to deliver a small number of testable products, after which the winning prime contractor is awarded a low rate initial production contract, followed by full rate production and eventually sustainment business. After the original round of purchasing is completed, it is quite rare to see a government switch contractors. During the early stages of development and production, the government generally purchases using cost-plus contracts, which shift the financial burden of cost overruns to the customer, but the potential profit is lower. Given the immense risk of cost overruns in designing complex products such as bomber aircraft, this dynamic frequently works in the contractors favor. As programs age to the production phase, they tend to move toward fixed-price contracts, often split into phases or lots, where the unit economics evolve over time as production can be scaled up for a successful program. Although fixed-price contracts carry more financial risk because the burden of cost overruns rests on the contractor, they tend to be more profitable because manufacturing costs become better understood and can even decline significantly as a program ages and delivery volumes increase. Considering the opportunity for additional revenue and profits from maintenance of delivered weapons systems (""sustainment"" in the military contracting jargon), these mature program contracts often become long-standing cash cows because program life cycles can last decades.Switching costs for the military customer are generally predicated on the mission-criticality of the product, extended product cycles, a lack of viable alternative products, and the substantial time investment or risk involved in switching suppliers. The major products for U.S.-based defense contractors include military vehicles (including land, air, and sea-based vehicles), intelligence-gathering and communication systems, radars and sensors, and munitions. The ability for a military to succeed at its strategic objectives and defeat an adversary, as well as protecting the lives of soldiers and civilians, are contingent on these products working as intended, which we think protects the proven suppliers from upstart competition. Product cycles are a source of differentiation. We view the products with the longest procurement cycles, such as fighter jets and submarines, as the moatiest because contracts with decades-long fulfillments provide extraordinarily long-term revenue and profit visibility. We see short-cycle products, such as defense IT contracting less favorably. As contracts for defense hardware essentially grant a monopoly over that product, we also see some modest switching costs stemming from a lack of viable alternatives, but this is partially mitigated by the governments right to license patents to third parties as well as the fact that product cycles for similar systems often overlap and may be provided by competing suppliers. More important to us is the extensive investment required to replicate a product that fulfills a mission. Product development in this industry ranges from years to decades, and if the military is dissatisfied with the product, it is much faster and easier to work with the existing contractor to fix it than to fund the development of a brand-new program to replace it. Following this framework, we view the moatiest segments as those with the most difficult-to-replicate products with the longest upgrade cycles and the longest production cycles. We believe the marine segment enjoys one of the widest moats in the defense industry. The company is one of only two major shipbuilders in the U.S. Though shipbuilding is not a growth market, the segment benefits from steady, decades-long procurement cycles and uses technology that is unique even among defense contractors (specifically outfitting the nuclear reactor chamber of submarines). This segment receives about two thirds of revenue from the Virginia-class attack submarine, a nuclear-powered boat and is a contractor on the Navys highest priority development program, the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, which is also powered through a nuclear reactor. Precisely two firms possess the technological capabilities to produce these products (in the United States) over any time horizon, and to preserve the know-how at both facilities, the Navy tends to split the work on its subs between General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls. As the Navy plans to procure Columbia-class boats through 2042, we remain confident in the cash flow-generating capacity of the segment without needing to consider future contract wins. We think the combat systems segment is wide-moat. This segment generally produces land-based vehicles such as tanks and the Stryker family of wheeled combat vehicles, as well as similar systems for allied militaries globally. Product complexity for land-based combat vehicles prohibits new entrants, even among defense contractors. Land combat systems are incredibly long cycle, for example, the military has procured General Dynamics M1 Abrams tank consistently since the 1980s, including various technology and armor upgrades, as the Armys main battle tank, which gives us confidence in General Dynamics profitable revenue-generating potential for years into the future (the U.S. Army's next generation tank is not due to enter service until 2035). This segment also benefits from switching costs stemming from the mission criticality of the product, as lives would be endangered if the product does not work as intended. We think the IT Services business unit within the technologies segment is less moaty than the rest of the General Dynamics portfolio, and we regard it as narrow moat. The core defense-contracting moat qualities apply to the IT services business, which provides data processing, cybersecurity, and intelligence services to the military, but are not as durable. While we agree that specialized individuals (for example, with technical and engineering know-how, often combined with security clearance) are required to service these contracts, and we see intangible assets associated with the organization's ability and learnings in implementing and integrating complex networked systems for government agencies, and with a focus on modernizing its infrastructure, that the U. S. military (and adjacent organizations) will demand such services in the near to medium term, we believe the rapid evolution of the technologies and the shorter contracting cycles do not beget a wide moat. As evidence of this, there are several more pure-play defense IT contractors than defense prime contractors, including Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, Science Applications International, as well as segments of other prime contractors such as RTX and Northrop Grumman (though these have in recent years divested much of their IT services and related business lines). Further, government IT contracts are recompeted periodically, which is not conducive to the generation of excess returns, as even if the contractor wins the re-bid contract it is likely to drive returns down closer to the cost of capital. This segment, which last reported stand-alone operating margin for 2019 earned lower margins than any other in the portfolio. General Dynamics cites the fact that IT Services and Mission Systems serve the same customer base and increasingly 'go to market together' which leads us to believe General Dynamics invested in this segment to maintain access to more opportunities to install and maintain more of its products.We believe that General Dynamics mission systems business unit within the technologies segment is wide-moat. This segment produces various sensors, secure communication systems, and military electronics. The ability for soldiers to effectively communicate and navigate is a force-multiplier for the military. Since adversaries actively work to disrupt the ability of sensors to function as intended, we expect that the customer is highly sensitive to changes in the quality of the sensor or jammer. While product complexity does prevent new entrants into the industry, we do not believe the product complexity is insurmountable in this segment. We believe the primary moat source for this segment is switching costs stemming from a large installed base on long-cycle products such as satellites, ships, and aircraft as well as a highly mission-critical product. For example, General Dynamics produces the radomes or the encrypted communication systems on almost every U.S. military aircraft. Reoutfitting every military aircraft and retraining pilots on an alternate system would take years and would not accomplish much given the companys stellar track record. We believe that reoutfitting the disparate communications hardware on various military products in various locations on earth or in space, along with commonality issues with other military products would make it incredibly difficult for the customer to change to a new provider, and the cost at failure for improperly implementing the change would be incredibly high risk for the military. General Dynamics aerospace segment, which is dominated by Gulfstream Business Jets, requires a different framework because it is a civilian product, but it still possesses a wide moat based primarily on the intangible asset of the complexity of aircraft manufacturing. The business jet market is a little more fragmented than the duopoly commercial aircraft market, but product complexity ensures that only Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault can compete in the long-range, large-cabin end of the business jet market. This market comprises only about 700 deliveries annually (roughly 200 of which are long-range, large-cabin) and demand is generally driven by new, high-quality products, as previous customers must be convinced to upgrade. General Dynamics' aerospace division has outpaced competitors in terms of revenue and margins, taking substantial volume share since the introduction of the G650 in 2012, and has successfully managed the risk of making the transition to new aircraft, as it moved from the G450 and G550 to the G500 in 2018 and G600 in 2019 and plans to launch the G700 in 2023. Though Dassault and Bombardier have produced newer large-cabin products, we have not seen much evidence that these offerings have resonated as well with customers. Gulfstream has gained unit share within the large cabin segment and now has about half of total deliveries. The company consistently generates superior margins to competitors, likely due to progressing further along the learning curve. Gulfstream has an extensive, global product support network that allows them to regularly take the top position among product support networks, which creates a sticky stream of aftermarket revenue, representing about a quarter of segment sales. We believe that substantial service network benefits bolster the companys moat by boosting the product lines image as a luxury brand. We see some switching costs in the time it takes to retrain a pilot on the new aircraft, but believe intangible assets is the primary moat source for this segment.","We assign General Dynamics a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.Although U.S. defense spending has risen recently, as has that of allied partners, the risk always remains that defense budgets get caught up in political wrangling; even if the money eventually gets approved, the Defense Department cannot spend it until that happens, which can hamper contractors' ability to plan and execute on existing contracts.General Dynamics also faces execution risk related to properly completing its contracts. Recent disruptions in the labor market, affecting those specialized skill sets that defense contractors require (including personnel who need security clearance to work on restricted projects), and the supply chain from metal to microchips has exacerbated this risk for General Dynamics and its peers. The contactor bears the financial risk of cost overruns or delays in fixed-price production programs, so a poorly executed development contract may financially strain General Dynamics.The company also faces some top-line cyclical risk in the aerospace segment. As business jets are big-ticket, discretionary luxury goods, orders can dry up or get canceled during cyclical economic downturns. Lower volumes reduce margin due to potential price pressure and exposure to negative operating leverage. Defense contractors produce cutting-edge technology for military purposes, which can be a controversial business and highlights the issue of product governance: if the company's products were misused and/or fell into the wrong hands, the firm could face reputational and legal consequences. U.S. defense contractors are closely regulated (by the U.S. state and defense departments) regarding what buyers (usually foreign governments) they may sell weapons to. We also think any potential carbon taxes or limitations would almost certainly reduce business jet demand, though the aviation industry has numerous projects underway to design more-efficient modes of propulsion for air travel.","We assign General Dynamics an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation rating based on a sound balance sheet rating, exceptional investments rating, and appropriate shareholder distribution rating. General Dynamics has historically eschewed material financial leverage but took on about two turns of net debt relative to EBITDA to fund the acquisition of CSRA, a government IT services provider. The company intends to pay down much of the debt over the next three years, and we think the firm has the cash on hand and free cash flow to achieve this goal. We think General Dynamics deserves an exceptional investments rating. We appreciate that management is continuing to invest in new platforms for Gulfstream, as we believe that new, quality product is the primary driver of private jet demand. On the defense side, we think management has developed and maintains strong and somewhat differentiated capabilities, particularly in its marine segment, resulting in a solid pipeline from its backlog. Further, General Dynamics has a very strong record of disciplined execution on its capital-intensive programs, which increases our confidence that its internal investments will pay off over time. Regarding external investments, General Dynamics has been less active than its larger peers. Its most recent big deal was in 2018, when General Dynamics purchased CSRA for nearly $10 billion, a reasonable multiple of 11.6 times EBITDA and about where other defense services companies were trading at the time. From a moat perspective, we viewed the transaction as dilutive to the companys wide moat, as it doubled the companys exposure to an at-best narrow-moat business with lower operating margins than the rest of the portfolio. Managements thesis was that additional scale would allow the firm to better compete in a changing market that favored larger contracts, but this has not flowed through to the financials quite yet: 2019 was a challenging transition year for the IT services segment and the 2020 pandemic prevented consultants from completing some contracts the firm could not perform work outside of government facilities. In recent quarters, management has reported sequential improvements in the IT services segment's profitability. We don't think M&A should be the primary factor for assessing the investment capability of a defense prime contractor, and we dont expect much M&A going forward because the industry is already quite consolidated. We think General Dynamics deserves an appropriate shareholder distribution rating. General Dynamics is the only defense prime that has raised its dividend for 25 years, and has historically delivered quite a bit of cash to shareholders, which we view favorably as we do not think the firm could accelerate growth with internal investment or has material value-accretive M&A opportunities. The trailing five-year compound growth rate of General Dynamics dividend per share is 8.4%. Simultaneously, the company delivered roughly $5.6 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases, which reduced the diluted weighted average share count from 2018-22 by about 7%. Given this solid history of delivering cash to the shareholder and the stability of the business model, we think long-term investors can expect these activities to continue.","General Dynamics is a defense contractor and business jet manufacturer. The firms segments include aerospace, marine, combat systems, and technologies. General Dynamics' aerospace segment creates Gulfstream business jets and operates a global aircraft servicing operation. Combat systems produces land-based combat vehicles such as the M1 Abrams tank and Stryker armored personnel carrier, as well as munitions. The marine segment creates and services nuclear-powered submarines, destroyers, and other ships. The technologies segment contains two main units, an IT business that primarily serves the government market and a mission systems business that focuses on products that provide command, control, computing, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities to the military.","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, General Dynamics maintained one of the best balance sheets among the large public defense contractors. General Dynamics issued some debt in 2020 due to pandemic-related uncertainties, and gross debt/EBITDA stood at 2.0 times at the end of 2022. General Dynamics had a sizable debt maturity in 2021, and has a much more manageable maturity schedule over the rest of our forecast period. Over the medium term, we expect the company will bring gross debt/EBITDA to its normal historical levels below a single turn. We think it makes sense for General Dynamics to generally carry a lower debt burden than peers because the business jet segment is more cyclical than the acyclical defense contracting business.General Dynamics produces a substantial amount of cash flow to service any debt burden, and we anticipate that the company would be able to access the capital markets at minimal cost if necessary.",GD,Industrials,68139651072.0,NYQ,842179.0,USD,247.3300018310547,True,0,226.93251863367763,259.98557102533084,1

In the New Zealand materials and distributions business, Fletcher reported volumes from residential customers are expected to be about 5% softer over fiscal 2024 than prior guidance, due to slower demand for residential housing. Despite this, Fletchers own residential construction business is reporting strong year-to-date sales, reflecting its positioning as a lower-cost housing provider, enabling it to maintain demand through the downturn. We have lifted our fiscal 2025 volume estimates for the residential development business, offsetting a fiscal 2024 decline in volume in the materials and distribution business. Trading at a 27% discount to our fair value estimate Fletcher shares screen as undervalued. We think the current share price is an overhang from the Western Australia Iplex pipes issue. We have already included a total cost of AUD 85 million pretax in our modeling, which is in a range between two potential scenarios of industry costs provided by management. Statistics New Zealand reports that consents for single-dwelling homes were 36% lower in August 2023 than a year prior. For Fletcher, this means less demand for its building and construction materials, per managements updated guidance. About 40% of earnings in these businesses is exposed to the residential segment. We dont expect any change to volumes in the less cyclical segments of infrastructure and commercial. Remarkably, Fletchers residential development business remains strong. The business develops detached houses, townhouses, and apartments in high-growth areas of Auckland and Christchurch. Volumes have remained robust since June 2023, with about 20 house sales per week. We think demand is due to Fletchers positioning as a lower-cost residential builder, making its homes more desirable when costs of borrowing are high.","An improvement in the Australia business is likely to lift ROIC and increase shareholder value.  Government spending on infrastructure projects and long-term population growth in Australia and New Zealand provides a durable source of earnings growth. Significant investment in residential development fully leverages the benefits of Fletcher's different business units, leading to an integrated construction company with strong operating leverage.",Fletcher operates in cyclical and competitive markets with minimal differentiation and is prone to periods of operating deleverage and structural margin compression Management demonstrated poor capital allocation and investment in Australia and commoditized building products will not generate any durable shareholder value in the long run. Attempts to turn around underperforming segments distracts management from focusing on enhancing returns in performing businesses.,27/10/2023,"Fletcher Building operates across six segments: building products; distribution; concrete; Australia; residential and development and construction. Fletcher's earnings are tied to construction activity in Australia and New Zealand. In fiscal 2023, EBIT was approximately split: 25% building products; 17% residential and development; 16% distribution; 18% concrete; 21% Australia; and 3% construction. Fletcher's medium-term strategy is focused on improving group EBIT margins by up to 200 basis points to achieve a mid-cycle EBIT margin of between 9% and 10%. Key components of the strategy include; NZD 800 million in growth capital expenditures over fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2027, improving margins in Australia; increase the number of low-risk and higher-margin construction projects, margin expansion in building materials, distribution, and concrete through operating efficiency and additional capacity, and disciplined investment in residential and development.  We see merits to this strategy; however, we expect short-term weakness in new residential activity, driven by rising interest rates and elevated building consents. We also see risks of softening in nonresidential construction following driven by a weakening outlook for business conditions. We also note that certain businesses demonstrate limited competitive advantages, are cyclical and lack differentiation. Moreover, Fletcher operates with limited pricing power. Cyclical revenue and a high fixed cost base indicated high levels of operating leverage, which results in margin compression in a downturn. Against this backdrop, we forecast EBIT margins to contract in the short term as higher interest rates are likely to adversely affect the level of residential activity. Longer-term, we expect midcycle margins of between 9% and 10% driven by an ongoing focus on operating efficiency, improved share of earnings from higher-margin businesses of residential and development and concrete, and margin improvement in Australia and construction.  ","We do not allocate Fletcher Building an economic moat. Several of Fletchers businesses lack any competitive advantage and account for the majority of earnings. These businesses operate in an environment with high levels of competitive intensity placing downward pressure on prices and limiting the forms economic profit potential. This limits the ability of the business to generate a meaningful return on invested capital, or ROIC, to weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, spread. Fletchers lack of competitive advantages is due to the fact the building products business sells a portfolio of relatively commoditized and undifferentiated products which are readily available as imports from larger scale overseas manufacturers. Fletcher also demonstrates little to no pricing power across its range of products and has historically struggled to pass on input cost increases at various points in the cycle. Revenue cyclicality also means the business is prone to periods of negative operating leverage and margin compression. Historical ROICs has averaged 9.1% over the 10 years to fiscal 2022, which is below our estimated WACC of 9.8%. However, we expect return on invested capital to average 11.3% over our 10-year forecast period. This exceeds our estimated weighted average cost of capital estimate by 150 basis points. We forecast this improvement in WACC to be driven by a recovery in construction earnings, no further deterioration in underlying earnings of the Australian business and an increased contribution from the residential and development business which develops residential property at scale with improving efficiency and costs.The Concrete segments operations span the upstream activities of aggregate and cement production. The segments Winstone Aggregates operates several quarries nationally, with the majority located on the North Island. Fletchers Golden Bay cement unit supplies about half of the market with access to key raw materials including limestone and energy to produce clinker. The plant sits close to the major demand center of Auckland. Ordinarily these characteristics and the high transportation costs for cement would convey a strong competitive advantage, but that advantage is constrained in New Zealand. The proximity to water opens competition to imports and Fletcher lacks the economies of scale of its overseas competitors. The concrete segments downstream activities comprise Firth Industries which participates in masonry, ready-mix and bagged dry concrete markets.Fletchers Building Products segment manufactures products such as laminates, glass-wool insulation, pipes, and steel products. The segment products are highly commoditized and not sufficiently differentiated and demonstrate limited or no pricing power. Most products in Fletchers building product portfolio are vulnerable to imported substitutes in imports. Fletcher's brands have strong market awareness but lack sufficient brand equity to command a premium.While Winstone appears to have favorable characteristics, we estimate it accounts for a minority of the earnings within the building products division. Winstone Wallboards is the dominant producer of plasterboard in New Zealand and has a 95% share of the market. Winstone Wallboards benefits from a strong brand and Fletchers distribution capabilities. The business has an unrivalled distribution capability offering next-day, on-site delivery nationwide to trade customers. While there is competition from overseas, it is difficult to match Winstones service and distribution capabilities, which leverages the PlaceMakers retail footprint. Fletchers distribution businesses comprise retail chains PlaceMakers and Mico within New Zealand. PlaceMakers is a building materials outlet with a focus on the B2B trade market of builders and contractors. Mico is Fletchers plumbing and bathroom fittings business and sells products like basins, toilets, and pipe fittings. Both businesses operate a strong network of stores and also command a strong market share of around 30%. Placemakers appear to be unique in that it is one of only two vertically integrated building products distributors in New Zealand. Despite this, several distributors remain facilitating a sufficient amount of competition in the New Zealand market. These competitors include ITM, Mitre10, Carters, and Bunnings. The Australia segment has a history of asset impairments and is yet to demonstrate any meaningful gains in market share or operating margins. The Australian segment is roughly split between building products and distribution. Building product operations include the manufacture of laminate and particle board, plastic pipe systems, and glass-wool insulation while distribution is largely represented by its Tradelink business. Tradelink is the second-largest plumbing and bathroom products distributor in Australia. The distribution business has been unable to demonstrate market share growth, underperforming the market-leader Reece Plumbing. The groups Residential and Development business produces a mixture of residential homes, apartments, and retirement homes predominantly in the Auckland and Christchurch regions in New Zealand. Land is purchased strategically at scale quantities to reduce costs and then further developed thereby reducing infrastructure development costs. The land is also subsequently rezoned, further enhancing the value of Fletchers assets. The rezoned land can either sold or further developed by Fletcher through the construction of residential home or apartments. We see the residential and development division as having the ability to develop projects at scale reducing unit building costs. Fletchers manufacturing base also provides the business with preferential access to materials. Proprietary panelization technology facilities development efficiency, dramatically reducing the time to construct a home. Despite these stated advantages, the business operates with low barriers to entry and operating margins which do not appear to be structurally superior to the peer set of Australian and New Zealand-based developers. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is Medium, in line with building materials peers James Hardie and Boral. Fletcher Building is subject to cyclical factors but a robust balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation helps to offset the impacts of earnings volatility. Fletchers end market demand is subject to the direction of fiscal policy and interest rates. Factors such as foreign investment, population growth, net migration, and other demographic shifts are also contributors which impact underlying demand for Fletchers products and services and may alter the long-term growth outlook for the company. Levels of domestic interest rates affecting housing affordability and house prices are also affected by global interest rates, inflation expectations and capital flows. The New Zealand dollar, and hence the cost of imports, is subject to factors including gross domestic product growth and inflation. Fletcher is also subject to imports competition in light weight products which limits the firm's pricing power and ability to generate attractive margins. Fletcher's largest ESG risk is from its concrete business, which accounts for an approximate 50% of Fletcher's greenhouse gas emissions. Cement manufacturing emits carbon dioxide in the clinker manufacturing stage. We believe additional carbon regulation affecting Fletcher Buildings concrete segment is probable but not material. We anticipate Fletcher being able to pass on any incremental cost to consumers because of the lack of substitutable alternatives for concrete and cement. Fletcher is committed to environmentally sustainable practices, including a 30% reduction in carbon emissions on 2018 levels by 2030 (which includes a 15% reduction in the concrete business) and net zero by fiscal 2050.","We allocate Fletcher Building a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. Fletchers balance sheet is robust, investments are rated as fair, and distribution to shareholders is mixed. While Fletchers revenue cyclicality and operating leverage introduce risk, Fletchers balance sheet is in a reasonably strong position with net debt (excluding lease liabilities)/EBITDA of 1.2 times at the end of fiscal 2023. We expect the balance sheet to remain solid for the foreseeable future. We do not see a material strengthening or weakening in Fletchers underlying potential moat sources arising from future investment activities. Fletcher has experienced value destruction through acquisitions in the past, and we believe the appetite for large-scale acquisition activity is low, unless the opportunity offers Fletcher an appealing long-term opportunity to grow outside of the New Zealand market. Fletchers focus on automation, customer service, and the digitalization of workflows is strategically beneficial. We view Fletchers distributions to shareholders as mixed. We support Fletchers intention to distribute capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. On-market buybacks can be appropriate provided they are undertaken at a discount to fair value. The risk with a cyclical business such as Fletcher is that the cash flows to facilitate buybacks are strong near cycle highs, which generally coincide with elevated share prices. ","Fletcher Building is a New Zealand-based building materials company with operations focused in New Zealand, but also extending to Australia. It has a conglomerate structure with diverse operations across concrete, building products, steel, retail distribution, construction, and development. Having previously expanded internationally through acquisitions, operations have gradually refocused on the New Zealand and Australian businesses.","Fletchers balance sheet remains relatively robust. Leveragedefined as net debt/EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilitiesstood at 1.2 times at the end of fiscal 2023, remaining within managements target of 12 times. Absent a major acquisitionwhich we dont anticipatewe forecast the balance sheet to remain healthy, assuming a dividend payout of around 63%. We believe management will remain prudent in maintaining balance sheet capacity and be highly disciplined with investments given the inherent cyclical nature of the business and an expected weakening in construction activity brought about by the recent rapid increase in interest rates.",FBU.NZ,Basic Materials,3672476160.0,NZE,946460.0,NZD,4.53000020980835,True,1,4.718209832210465,4.4129629517728395,0
24/11/2023,Sodexo: Tailwinds Persist in 2023,Sodexo,SW,4,26/10/2023,Michael Field,102.4,EUR,23/11/2023,118.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,26/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Sodexo finished out the fiscal year strongly, delivering organic revenue growth of close to 12%, with operating margins now back above prepandemic levels. The most interesting part of the release was the outlookmanagement is expecting 6%-8% organic revenue growth over the next two years, a huge uplift from prepandemic levels. Additionally, management has guided to between 30 and 40 basis points in operating margin improvement per year. We reiterate our EUR 118 fair value estimate and believe the shares offer plenty of upside potential from here. With revenue in the business and administrations division running above prepandemic levels, the recovery here is complete. The question on investors minds now is how long the momentum can continue for, and whether management can deliver on the promises of increased operating margin expansion and structurally higher revenue growth. Our thesis, underpinning our above-consensus fair value estimate, has been that much of the gap in performance between Sodexo, and the world's No. 1 caterer Compass Group, can be bridged. Our take is that the pandemic effectively reset Sodexos cost base, and supercharged top-line growth and client retention, with the latter running at 95% now. While we could not have predicted the pandemic, we believe these effects are now what will help push Sodexo shares closer to our fair value estimate.","Sodexo estimates that the entire market for outsourced food services is only about 50% penetrated, which leaves ample room for the company to increase market share. Sodexos retention rate has averaged close to 94% for the past decade, an indication of the firm's strong client base. Strong growth in the high-margin benefits and reward services division could be a significant boon to group operating margins over the next few years.","Cuts to investment in the commodity sector could pressure Sodexos remote site business. Sodexos strategy of pursuing integrated contracts could prove detrimental as it drifts from its core competency of food services, where barriers to entry are higher. Sodexos exposure to Latin America could remain a headwind for its benefits and reward services business for some time to come.",12/06/2023,"As one of only two global food service providers in a highly fragmented market, Sodexo is well positioned to benefit from the outsourcing trend that has pervaded developed markets in recent years. Sodexo has also been successful in taking market share from smaller, more local providers that cannot match the operational capabilities and proprietary knowledge that come from operating on a global basis. Where Sodexo differs from peers is in its strategy of pursuing integrated contracts, combining various facilities-management activities with food-service contracts. Over time, this has led to a more diversified revenue base, with food service now accounting for under 60% of group revenue, down from nearly 80% in 2005. There are also several other benefits from this approach, as integrated contracts, by virtue of their increased complexity, are generally longer in length than single-service contracts. By way of example, the 2016 $2.5 billion Rio Tinto contract win in the Pilbara region in Australia was a 10-year contract (in which Sodexo will effectively manage a number of entire towns, incorporating accommodation management with transport, food, and cleaning services). In addition, by embedding themselves into more of their clients' activities through integrated contracts, food-service companies can further reduce the ease with which clients can switch suppliers or obtain price checks, as the price per service is obscured. We believe this will help to further improve upon Sodexos already-impressive client retention rate. Lastly, another differentiator and strong source of growth for Sodexo comes in its benefits and reward service division. Despite comprising only 4% of group revenue, this division contributes almost 30% to the group EBIT line. This business effectively issues prepaid vouchers (or cards) to employees on behalf of their employers, offering a tax-efficient solution for rewarding employees. This business is particularly asset-light, and as a result, it generates EBIT margins north of 30%. While local and regional players operate in this sector, there are just two firms with global capabilities in this extremely scalable business.","Switching costs form a narrow moat for Sodexo. Contracts in food service vary in length but are generally between three and five years, and integrated contracts, such as the recently announced Rio Tinto contract, can be as long as 10 years in duration. These multiyear contracts, combined with material fit-out costs, dissuade switching providers, as does the potential disruption to service, particularly in sensitive areas such as hospital catering, in which Sodexo caters toward a captive audience (that is, bedridden patients). In fact, more than 50% of the companys revenue stems from areas such as healthcare, seniors, education, and remote sites, all of which contain a large captive audience that cannot easily opt out of using Sodexos facilities if they do not like the food.Sodexos strategy of offering bundled services, such as facilities management combined with food services, also makes price checking (and indeed, switching providers) a more complicated task. This is evidenced by contract retention rates averaging close to 94% over the past decade, a level that the firm could actually improve upon as integrated contracts become a larger part of revenue.In our opinion, strong relationship management secures this high level of retention. Assuming that price remains competitive within the industry, clients generally have little motivation to switch providers once a good working relationship has been established, and hence opt to renew existing contracts. This is particularly true with clients that Sodexo services on a regional or global basis. As the firm is one of only three food-service companies with global capabilities, client motivation to choose Sodexo stems from minimising the risk and inconvenience of dealing with multiple operators across their global networks, in addition to the lack of standardisation that comes with this strategy.","Sodexo has a Medium Uncertainty Rating. The company's exposure to commodities through its remote sites division has recently proved to be a drag on performance. The key concern here is that further closures of existing facilities and cuts to future project expenditure will affect Sodexo negatively for the short/medium term. While exposure to oil and gas/mining comprises less than 6% of revenue, this business tends to be higher-margin.Corporate profit margins are currently at their highest ever point. Over time, this trend has proven to be cyclical; if repeated, this pattern could be damaging for Sodexo in two ways. First, many of Sodexos large contracts (for example, AstraZeneca), in which it provides relatively high-end catering, essentially act as perks for employees. Should corporate profitability wane at some point, then it is logical that companies would cut back on perks such as these. Second, as unemployment falls (a pattern that we are currently witnessing), wage pressures increase. Given that much of Sodexo's staff is employed at the lower end of the pay scale, any wage pressures in the market would have a material effect on Sodexo's bottom line.","The holding company owned by Sodexo's late founder, Pierre Bellon, is a major shareholder (42.8% of capital and 57.5% of voting rights). Furthermore, four of Bellon's children, as well as his brother, are members of the board, with daughter Sophie Bellon the chair and CEO, giving the family effective control of the company. However, this is not unusual with large continental European corporations, and we believe that Sodexo has benefited significantly from the stability that this type of ownership structure brings. This has borne out in the company's financials, in which we have witnessed rising operating margins and extremely stable returns on invested capital in excess of weighted average cost of capital over the past decade. However, we believe that down the road, management will need to prove that allocating shareholder capital toward expanding its noncore service segments will produce better returns on invested capital over time.Sodexo has a history of promoting from within. Denis Machuel, who took over as CEO in January 2018, was with the company since 2007, and Michel Landel (CEO 2005-18) had served with the company for more than 30 years. Machuel previously ran Sodexo's benefits and rewards services business, the highest-growth area in the group.With long-standing board member Sophie Bellon taking the reigns of the company we do not see any major deviation from the current corporate strategy. As such, we believe that the company's management team deserves a Standard capital allocation rating.","Sodexo is one of the largest food service companies globally, operating in more than 80 countries with annual sales of over EUR 21 billion. Sodexo's model stems from operating on-premise catering facilities, rather than centralised industrial kitchens. While food services remains the largest business segment (58% of revenue in 2022), the company has actively pursued a strategy of diversifying its business activities into other areas, such as facilities-management services, which now represents 38% of group revenue.","Sodexo boasts a very healthy financial position. At the end of fiscal 2022, its debt/capital position stood at around 57%, in line with its 10-year average, while on a net debt/EBITDA basis, the ratio was just over 1.8 times. The company has been active of late in refinancing its debt, with more than 90% of borrowing now based on long-term fixed rates.Aside from the Centerplate acquisition in 2018, Sodexo has been relatively conservative in the M&A space over the last few years. The result of this is a surplus of cash on the balance sheet, which the company has been active in returning to shareholders. Over the past seven years, Sodexo has been able to reduce its share count by almost 6% through the use of share buybacks. We expect Sodexo's balance sheet to remain conservatively geared.

24/11/2023,Essity Is Committed to Portfolio Optimization and Long-Term Profit Improvement,Essity AB,ESSITY B,4,26/10/2023,Diana Radu,260.4,SEK,24/11/2023,280.0,Medium,,Standard,,26/10/2023,"No-moat Essity delivered solid third-quarter results, including a substantial sequential improvement in EBITA margin to 12.2% from 10.7%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement, with Essity well on track to reach pre-inflation margin levels and even surpass them as it leaves behind the peaks in input cost inflation and continues to engage in methodical portfolio management. Organic sales growth in the quarter tracked our forecast, but net sales continued to benefit from a significant currency tailwind as a result of the weak Swedish krona. Incorporating the third-quarter results into our model and increasing our 2023 adjusted operating margin forecast to 11.2% from 10.6% leads us to increase our fair value estimate to SEK 280 per share from SEK 260. The significant year-on-year operating margin improvement was driven by the gross margin line due to higher prices, lower raw materials, energy, and distribution costs, mix management, and cost savings. The professional hygiene and the health and medical segments saw the largest operating margin improvement of around 600 basis points year over year. This was supported by portfolio measures that saw Essity restructuring the professional hygiene segment and exiting unprofitable contracts in different areas of the business on top of the aforementioned gross profit drivers. The 6.9% price/mix and negative 3.1% volume contribution to net sales growth tracked our expectations, although with a slightly different segment breakdown. Pricing growth decelerated substantially in the consumer goods segment (4.6% in the third quarter compared with 13.6% in the first half) as cost inflation no longer justified taking further pricing actions in a difficult competitive environment with cash-strapped consumers. The other segments continued to see a solid price/mix contribution, mainly as a result of carryover from previous quarters, of around 10% on average.","We think favorable demographic trends and higher disposable income in emerging markets (38% of Essitys 2021 net sales) will drive long-term per capita growth of health and hygiene products. Essity exited markets where it failed to capture significant market share, giving us confidence that management prioritizes long-term ROICs over potentially margin-dilutive top-line growth. Essitys leading incontinence brand, Tena, should be able to maintain demand amid an aging global population, driving high-single-digit growth in the higher-margin personal-care segment.","Essity is exposed to volatile input costs such as pulp and is not always able to pass on costs in the short term, leading to volatile earnings. With a mix of commoditized products, volumes could decline if consumers trade out or down from Essity's fare in a more challenging economic climate. We believe Essity has slightly overleveraged its balance sheet at a time of significant pressure on profitability, which will prevent it from pursuing acquisition targets as valuations become more attractive.",26/10/2023,"We think Essity faces obstacles to amassing brand power in its portfolio. Competition from both branded and private-label offerings in the global personal-care and hygiene category, plus low barriers to entry and a lack of switching costs, hampers Essity's ability to form the entrenched retail relationships needed to secure a competitive edge. We assign Essity a no-moat rating. We believe Essity's retail relationships are weaker than its largest competitors' given a more limited retail portfolio and a less consolidated geographical footprint when compared with narrow-moat Kimberly-Clark and wide-moat Procter & Gamble. Additionally, the large share of private label in Europe, Essitys largest market, has prevented the firm from developing brand recognition or economies of scale in its more commoditized businesses, such as consumer tissue (40% of 2021 revenue). As evidence, its consumer tissue-adjusted operating margin (9.4% in 2021) remains materially below that of Kimberly-Clark (14.7%). Still, we believe Essity plays in segments that benefit from secular trends such as population aging in the developed world, increasing disposable income in emerging markets, as well as elevated awareness of and gradual decreases in the stigma associated with incontinence products among younger adults. The firm's large exposure to emerging markets (38% of 2021 revenue) and recent acquisitions in fast-growing spaces such as leakproof apparel (estimated by management to grow at a CAGR of 20% over the next five years), should contribute to strong top-line growth over the long term. We appreciate Essitys renewed strategic focus on higher-value-added segments such as consumer health, and across categories in personal care including incontinence and feminine care where we estimate private-label penetration remains under 10% globally (compared with above 35% for consumer tissue). The company has exited markets in which it hasn't been able to establish a leading position in these categories, which has enabled it to drive underlying improvements to its profitability, leading up to the highly inflationary environment of recent quarters, despite a lack of economic moat.","We assign a no-moat rating to Essity. We believe its relatively commoditized product portfolio, with outsize exposure to categories like consumer tissue and professional hygiene, where the purchase decisions tend to be primarily based on price rather than brand, has prevented the firm from establishing intangible assets sufficient to give us confidence that it can generate excess economic profits over the next decade. Return on invested capital including goodwill has averaged 9.6% over the past five years (compared with 23% for Kimberly-Clark), with the volatility created by input cost inflation and subinflationary pricing bringing it close to our 7.9% weighted cost of capital in a number of years. We anticipate economic profit generation will be especially challenging in the near term given the extraordinary cost inflation Essity is experiencing and a significant impact on margins. Since the company derives over half of its sales in Europe, where overall private-label penetration remains high, accounting for more than one third of consumer dollars spent in the hygiene and tissue market, we do not think that Essity has been able to demonstrate significant pricing power. This is evidenced by its gross and operating margins (averaging 29% and 11.6%, respectively, over the past three years) below those of Kimberly-Clark (33% and 17%). Essity is the third-largest player in the global tissue and hygiene market, but it holds a market share that is less than half that of the top two playersProcter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark. Its closest competitor in terms of portfolio overlapKimberly-Clarkhas been awarded a moat based on intangible assets, primarily given its entrenchment in retailers supply chains through its portfolio of well-known brands (five of which generate sales of over $1 billion) that span multiple store aisles. Essity owns three brands with sales in excess of $1 billion: Tena (the largest brand in adult incontinence), Tork (professional hygiene), and Vinda (the largest consumer tissue brand in Asia). However, we believe Essitys more limited retail portfolio compared with Kimberly-Clark and its less consolidated geographic footprint prevent the company from securing similar entrenchment in retailers supply chains. Essity has a larger share of sales attributable to the professional hygiene segment compared with Kimberly-Clark (21% versus 16%), where products are sold business to business. Similarly, most of its medical solutions portfolio (wound care, orthopedics, compression therapy) and part of its adult incontinence portfolio are not sold through traditional retail channels (around 18% of sales). Essity also derives around 6% of net sales from agreements to manufacture private-label consumer tissue products. Overall, we estimate that only around 55% of its net sales are generated from own-brand sales in the retail segment, and we believe its lower scale at retail impedes Essity from becoming a key supplier for retailers, limiting its bargaining power. Its geographic footprint further constricts the company from becoming entrenched with retailers in certain regions because one of its largest brands, Vinda, is exclusively focused on the Asia market, where Essity holds overall weak positions in other categories outside of consumer tissue.We believe the incontinence-care (17% of sales), feminine-care (7% of sales), and baby- care (7% of sales) product segments are overall less price sensitive than consumer tissue, with brand strength playing a more significant role as consumers typically prefer high-quality products and brands they trust in order to minimize the risk of product failure. This is demonstrated by the negligible private-label penetration in these categories (around 10% for incontinence, 4% for feminine care, and 7% for diapers). However, Essity is not the sole player in these markets offering high-quality products, and we believe its brand power is diminishing in incontinencewhere Tena is the global market leaderespecially in North America and Australia. North America has the highest annual usage of incontinence products, estimated to be around 5 times the level in emerging regions such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. However, Tena has lost ground in the U.S. to P&Gs Always brand following the re-entrance of P&G in the segment in 2014. During this time, Tena has gone from an 11% market share in 2013 to 6.5% in 2021, while Always has become the third-largest brand in the segment with a 15% market share in 2021 (behind the brands Depend and Poise from Kimberly-Clark that together control around 45% of the U.S. incontinence market).In feminine care and baby care, Essity doesnt hold leading market positions at a global level because it plays in a limited number of markets and routinely exits markets in which it struggles to gain traction amid strong competition from the much larger players in the two segments. While this flexible structure offers some benefits to profitability, we anticipate the firm will struggle to increase prices ahead of inflation for the foreseeable future, as pressure from both customers and competitors is unlikely to abate. We expect revenue growth to be underpinned by population growth, population aging in the developed world, as well as increased adoption and usage of hygiene products in underdeveloped markets, but with subinflationary price increases, consistent with the companys record. Over the past five years, we estimate that only the professional hygiene segment has managed to deliver a slight positive contribution to revenue from price/mix on an inflation-adjusted basis, while both the consumer tissue and the personal-care segments have seen a negative contribution from price/mix on average, after accounting for inflation.In the professional hygiene segment, Essity sells tissue dispensers, soaps, and sanitizers to institutional customers through its Tork brand. Although Tork is one the largest brands in professional hygiene globally, we believe brand strength plays a less important role for institutional customers, while switching costs are likely to be negligible because there is low differentiation among products, with the purchase decision primarily based on price. Finally, we dont believe the firm derives a competitive edge based on any other moat source. Its operating margins (which have historically hovered in the low teens) significantly lag the high teens to mid-20s of peers, failing to suggest the company has amassed a cost advantage. When taken together, we lack conviction that Essity will be able to generate economic profits over a 10-year horizon, in line with our no-moat rating.","We assign Essity a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The company experiences volatility as a result of input cost inflation and delays in passing it through to consumers, and is exposed to intense competition from both branded and private-label products in the health and hygiene space. Retail consolidation could decrease the likelihood that Essity would be able to maintain its shelf space, given that the company has a more limited retail scale than peers and therefore lower clout with retailers. Furthermore, significant private-label penetration in consumer tissue is likely to endure as discounters proliferate in Europe, Essity's largest market, limiting the companys ability to take pricing. Also, as the economic environment becomes more challenging and consumers tighten their purse strings, trading down to cheaper alternatives or decreased product usage could ensue.The company also faces environmental, social, and governance risks. We believe the largest risks to its operations are its water use, as well as its reliance on pulp manufactured from wood-based fibers, as deforestation could lead to the company facing raw material shortages. To reduce its reliance on wood-based pulp, Essity is taking steps to expand its recycling capacity in order to increase the share of recovered paper used in production, as well as exploring alternative fibers, such as pulp manufactured from wheat strawan agricultural byproduct.We also see some risks stemming from the large number of acquisitions that the company has pursued over the past few years. We believe the company faces the risk of overpaying for targets and overleveraging its balance sheet, while also facing the risk of failing to integrate all of the acquisitions and consequently putting too much pressure on the organization.","We assign Essity a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessments of fair investments with regard to strategic priorities and execution, a sound balance sheet, and appropriate shareholder distributions.We believe Essitys investment efficacy is fair. Acquisitions represent an important use of capital, with management pursuing a bolt-on acquisition strategy, as it looks to shift the portfolio focus from the commoditized consumer tissue segment into faster-growing and higher-margin segments across personal care and consumer health. Although we believe Essity has secured a good deal when acquiring Australian hygiene company Asaleo Care, with an implied EV/EBITDA of 9.6 times, the same thing cannot be said about its recent Knix deal in mid-2022. With an implied total enterprise value of SEK 4.1 billion ($400 million) and a 2021 EBITDA of SEK 95 million, the deal translates into an EV/EBITDA of around 40 times. Even though the acquisition offers the company a leading position in leakproof apparelthe fastest-growing segment in intimate hygienewe believe the price paid was excessive, especially at a time we would have expected management to take a more conservative approach and safeguard cash because it is experiencing a severe hit to profitability from the extraordinary input cost inflation. Nonetheless, we appreciate managements decision to exit certain underperforming markets (for example, baby care in Turkey and hygiene in India), which we think points to the firm's focus on geographies and categories that provide the highest returns rather than just those that drive top-line growth. This is similar to the strategy employed by wide-moat players like Procter & Gamble, and it gives us confidence that management is focused on improving profitability over time.We believe Essitys balance sheet is sound, but we are concerned about recent increases in gearing. Essity has a strong record, with an average net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times over the past five years, in line with peers and comfortably within its target of below 3 times, consistent with an investment-grade rating. However, it has been stepping up acquisitions over the past two years, which coupled with the depressed profit margins as a result of significant cost inflation, has led to an increase in leverage, and a net debt/EBITDA 2022 exit ratio of 3.1 times. Given this, we expect management will not pursue any further acquisitions in the near term, at least until profitability recovers, so we dont forecast any additional acquisition spending in 2023 beyond the deals already communicated. In the eventuality that Essity continues to pursue acquisitions that we deem as expensive and doesnt manage to reduce its gearing to comfortably below its target of 3 times, we would consider downgrading our Capital Allocation Rating. We believe Essity has access to enough liquidity to cover its short-term liabilities, and the free cash flow generation should be strong enough from 2023 onward to service its debt, but management needs to take a more conservative approach in order to successfully navigate the current highly volatile period.We deem shareholder distributions as appropriate. Essity employs a progressive dividend policy as the principal means of distributing capital to shareholders. The company has historically maintained a healthy payout ratio of between 45% and 60% while seeing dividends per share grow at a mid-single-digit rate since the company was listed in 2017. We think the company will continue to return excess cash to shareholders, mainly through dividends over the midterm. The dividend was also increased in 2022, by 4% to 7.25, despite the depressed profitability for the year. This has translated into a much higher payout ratio for the year, of around 90%. Further to 2022, we model a dividend payout ratio of around 50% over our five-year explicit forecast, consistent with the firms historical average.Essity offers Class A and Class B shares; Class A shares carry 10 times the voting rights of Class B shares. Nearly 10% of shares (30% of voting rights) are held by AB Industrivarden. Although Essity's share class structure limits the ability of minority interests to influence the firm's strategic direction, management has historically acted in the best interests of shareholders, and we expect that Class B shareholders will continue to be rewarded through consistent dividend growth and returns.","Essity is a health and hygiene company spun out of Svenska Cellulosa in June 2017. Essity's products span the feminine-care, baby-care, toilet paper, facial tissue, and wet wipes categories, as well as hand soap, hand sanitizers, and tissue dispensers for institutional customers. Essity also offers medical solutions in the form of wound care, orthopedics, and compression therapy, accounting for 7% of net sales in fiscal 2021. Essity operates in 150 markets and generates over 50% of its revenue in Europe, although it also maintains significant exposure to emerging markets (38% of net sales in 2021).","We think Essity is in decent financial health. Net debt/EBITDA ended 2022 at 3.1 times, ahead of the five-year average of 2.4 times. This has been driven by a step up in the number of acquisitions carried out, coupled with depressed profitability as a result of significant raw material cost inflation. We expect the company will prioritize debt repayment over the near term before making any further acquisitions or increasing dividends since management targets a solid investment-grade rating, equivalent to a net debt/EBITDA ratio of below 3 times.Dividends have been increased every year since the company's listing in 2017. In 2022, the dividend increase of 4% and the depressed profitability took the dividend payout ratio to 90%, significantly above the historical average of the last five years. Further to 2022, we model a dividend payout ratio of around 50% over our five-year explicit forecast, consistent with the firms historical average.We think Essity will be able to meet its short financial obligations given its plentiful access to liquidity, and we expect free cash flow generation to strengthen in 2023, enabling the company to comfortably service its current level of debt. We forecast improving interest coverage (EBIT/interest expense) over the midterm, averaging around 14 times over the next five years compared with 12 times over the past five years.",ESSITY-B.ST,Consumer Defensive,184432230400.0,STO,91592.0,SEK,260.1000061035156,True,1,240.73927359745173,241.68576086572898,0
24/11/2023,Phillips 66 Boosts Earnings and Shareholder Return Targets ,Phillips 66,PSX,3,,Allen Good,118.01,USD,23/11/2023,119.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,,No Text Available,"Phillips 66 is expanding its midstream and chemical segments so that refining will represent a smaller portion of earnings over time and help to mitigate the risk of falling refined product demand. Phillips 66 stands to benefit from higher crude oil prices, which could benefit the NGL fractionation operations in its midstream business. With one of the highest distillate yields among its peers, Phillips 66 is well positioned for the long term, where the growth outlook for distillate is more favorable than gasoline.","Narrowing of light crude spreads or rising natural gas prices could undercut key tenets of U.S. refiners' cost advantage, making Phillips 66 less competitive in the global export market. Phillips 66's ownership of NGL fractionation assets leaves its midstream earnings reliant on a recovery in crude oil prices and continued domestic volume growth. Phillips 66s diversification into midstream could mean shares continue to underperform if refining margins remain strong for years.",10/11/2023,"Phillips 66 remains the most diversified independent refiner with greater interests in marketing, chemical, and midstream assets than peers. While the performance of its refining segment will be the primary determinant of earnings in the near term, the midstream segment will increasingly be the value driver over time as Phillips 66 aims to grow its potential midcycle EBITDA by $4 billion (initially $3 billion) to $14 billion by 2025. With the buyout of DCP Midstream, Phillips 66 increased its midstream NGL business size and scale, which now stretches across the entire value chain from wellhead to market. With this larger platform, management plans to deliver over $1 billion of its targeted midcycle EBITDA growth. Refining will remain a critical segment as performance is set to improve. Its midcontinent refineries are some of the firm's best positioned, given their access to discount domestic and Canadian crudes. Its two Gulf Coast refineries benefit from pipelines that provide access to discount light and heavy crude, while the coastal location allows access to valuable export markets. Projects designed to increase utilization and capture rates and reduce costs are expected to improve its cost position and performance. Total cost savings across the entire organization, including headcount reduction are expected to deliver $1.1 billion by end-2023, plus a $300 million reduction in maintaining capital requirements. Both targets were increased from the initial total of $1 billion.  Phillips 66's two California refineries and one East Coast refinery are the least competitive of its U.S. portfolio. As a result, it's converting its San Francisco area refinery to produce 800 million gallons of renewable fuels by 2024, which it expects to deliver $700 million of EBITDA growth. Phillips 66 holds its chemical assets in CPChem as a 50/50 joint venture with Chevron. Production capacity is primarily concentrated in the U.S. (80%) and Middle East, where CPChem can take advantage of low-cost feedstock like ethane. Future growth will come from projects in the Gulf Coast and Qatar toward the end of the decade, with little contribution from this segment toward its 2025 goals.","Phillips 66 has one of the most geographically diverse portfolios among independent refiners. As a result, its relative ability to fully capitalize on U.S. crude discounts is limited. However, it still maintains a feedstock advantage in our view while benefiting from relatively low U.S. natural gas prices, which should result in midcycle margins that will be higher than previous cycles. Midcycle returns on capital should also remain strong at 10.5%. Thus, we think Phillips 66 earns a narrow moat rating.The company's overall refining complexity of 10.7 is on par with its two larger peers. Its most complex facilities are in California, the Gulf Coast, and Montana. Its midcontinent refineries are able to capitalize on discount light domestic crude as well as discount heavy Canadian crude. Its high-complexity Gulf Coast facilities should benefit from the increasing flow of light and heavy crude to the region, which affords greater flexibility and opportunity to capture crude differentials in varying market conditions. Its other refineries have less access to advantaged feedstocks. Narrower discounts for inland crude have reduced opportunities on the East and West Coast to rail and barge discount light crude to its refineries to back out more expensive foreign imports. As a result, the refineries in these regions are less competitive than those on the Gulf Coast or in the midcontinent. Except for its relatively small European (U.K., Germany) presence, Phillips 66s refineries benefit from low-cost U.S. natural gas that results in lower operating cost and higher gross margins than global peers and keeps most U.S. refiners on the lower end of the global cost curve. Higher natural gas prices in Europe help support higher Atlantic Basin margins, which low-cost refineries like Phillips 66 can capitalize on. Phillps 66 also is well positioned given its relatively higher yield of distillate, which has demonstrated higher margins than gasoline and is less at threat from vehicle electrification.We view Phillips 66s midstream segment as accretive to its narrow moat rating given its attractive collection of pipeline, terminal, marine, and NGL assets supported by fee-based take-or-pay contracts. Many of its assets are used to support refinery operations and face little competition. Greater expansion into NGL assets in recent years as well as the roll up of DCP it did not own increases the midstream segments commodity price exposure. However, while earnings might vary with prices, we expect the integrated network, including fractionation and export, to deliver excess returns through the cycle.Additionally, Phillips 66 has a large chemical business, which holds a cost advantage given its assets are located either in the U.S. Gulf Coast or Middle East where low-cost natural gas and discount domestic feedstock (NGLs) are accessible. We have incorporated ESG risk into our moat evaluation, but no risk is material or probable enough within the next 10 years to influence our narrow moat rating. Implementation of a carbon tax would likely impact demand by increasing the cost of refined product, but it is neither expected nor would it impact demand in the near term. Phillips 66 does disclose its GHG emissions and carbon intensity, while targeting a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 2030 and 50% by 2050, and a 15% reduction in Scope 3 emissions intensity by 2030.Phillips 66s investment in renewable diesel addresses potential petroleum product demand destruction while reducing its carbon intensity. The company is converting its 120 mb/d petroleum refinery in San Francisco to a renewable fuels production facility that will produce over 50 mb/d of renewable diesel by 2024. Refiners are increasingly investing in renewable diesel to reduce carbon intensity, given its 50% lower emissions than petroleum diesel and the increasing number of national and state governments, including California, with blending mandates and credits, which ensures growing demand and attractive margins. Phillips 66 forecasts at least 30% returns for the San Francisco project. Potential additional renewable projects could increase renewable fuel capacity from 800 million gallons to over 1 billion gallons. To facilitate offtake, Phillips 66 also plans to convert 600 retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by Rodeo.","Based on its fundamentals, ESG risk, and potential outcomes under our star rating system, we assign Phillips 66 a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.Success in refining is primarily a function of the difference between the amount the refiner pays for oil and the amount at which it sells the refined product. As such, the short- and long-term risks depend on movements in the relative prices of crude oil and refined product. Supply interruptions or increased demand that drive up oil prices, as well as demand destruction or economic slowdowns that depress gas prices, are the primary risks. In the long term, greater adoption of ride-sharing and autonomous or electric vehicles could erode demand for refined products.The strong operating performance over much of the past decade is attributable in part to wide crude differentials. Significant narrowing or elimination of these differentials would negatively affect future performance.Midstream growth is reliant on continued development of U.S. hydrocarbon resources while the NGL business is exposed to price volatility. We have incorporated ESG risks into our uncertainty rating, but they are not material or probable enough to alter the high rating. Phillips 66s primary ESG risk is the implementation of a carbon tax on the emissions associated with its operations and products. A carbon tax would likely increase the final price of refined products as emission costs would probably be borne by consumers. Although a carbon tax could be eventually implemented, the negative impact on product demand would likely take time. This applies to its midstream operations as well. Its chemical segment faces the risk that actions to limit plastic pollution reduce end-user demand. These actions will also likely take some time before having a material impact on demand. Phillips 66 also holds the risk of an oil or product spill or emissions from its refineries, but we expect the amounts to be small and any financial penalties to be manageable.","Based on our capital allocation framework, which evaluates soundness of the balance sheet, investment strategy, and appropriateness of shareholder distributions, Phillips 66 earns a Standard Morningstar capital allocation rating.Although Phillips 66s business has a high amount of operating leverage as well as revenue cyclicality, management operates with relatively low levels of debt to retain flexibility in times of market weakness. This was evident in its ability to raise debt during 2020 and still keep net debt to capital under 40% while net debt/EBITDA should remain below 2.0 on average during the next three years. While the company has some large near-term maturities, we do not anticipate any difficulty in rolling those over. All of this amounts to a sound balance sheet in our framework. Phillips scores a fair rating for its investment strategy. Management is primarily reallocating refining-generated cash flows to midstream and chemical investments, which can deliver steadier earnings and returns over time while setting a high bar for refining reinvestment. Given Phillips 66s weaker refining portfolio, this will likely prove a prudent choice, although it could leave refining in a worse competitive position over time. To its credit, however, management has decided to convert its uncompetitive Rodeo, California, petroleum refinery to renewable diesel, which holds a superior return potential and growth outlook thanks to global blending mandates. Midstream investment also has its risks as it's reliant on continued U.S. hydrocarbon production growth while the NGL business has price risk. Chemical investment will likely pay off over time, but margins have been challenged recently due to overcapacity as many other firms pursued Gulf Coast investment to capitalize on low feedstock prices. Finally, we see Phillips 66s shareholder distribution policy as appropriate, given the volatility of the refining business. Its policy is to invest about 60% of operating cash flow over time and return the remainder to shareholders. The policy sets clear expectations for investors while retaining flexibility to reduce payouts in difficult times like 2020. Although excess cash is typically available when market conditions are favorable and stock prices likely high, historically, repurchases have occurred below or near our fair value at the time, meaning they have not been value-destructive. About 70% of total share repurchases over the last 10 years occurred at a price/fair value of 1.0 or less","Phillips 66 is an independent refiner with 12 refineries that have a total crude throughput capacity of 1.9 million barrels per day, or mmb/d. In 2023, the Rodeo, California, facility will cease operations and be converted to produce renewable diesel. The midstream segment comprises extensive transportation and NGL processing assets and includes DCP Midstream, which holds 600 mbd of NGL fractionation and 22,000 miles of pipeline. Its CPChem chemical joint venture operates facilities in the United States and the Middle East and primarily produces olefins and polyolefins.","Prior to the acquisition of DCP, management focused on reducing debt accumulated during 2020 and succeeded in bringing debt back down to prepandemic levels with the net debt/capital ratio falling to 24%. After the acquisition, debt increased, but by the end of the third-quarter 2023, net debt/capital fell to 33%, albeit still above its targeted range of 25%-30%. Management has revised its shareholder return targets along with its updated earnings growth guidance. It previously planned for $10 billion-$12 billion of shareholder distributions by year-end 2024, but now expects to return $13-$15 billion. At its midcycle estimate of $10 billion in operating cash flow by 2025, it expects to direct at least 40% to shareholder returns.Capital spending will remain at $2 billion through 2024 but likely increase modestly thereafter given the growth in the business. At this level, management has suggested up to $7 billion could go toward shareholder returns at midcycle operating cash flow levels.

25/11/2023,We Expect Sandviks EBIT Margin Improvement To Persist; Marginally Raising Our FVE,Sandvik AB,SAND,3,23/10/2023,Matthew Donen,204.0,SEK,24/11/2023,200.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,23/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Sandvik reported a 7% decline in organic order intake during the third quarter, its largest decline since fourth-quarter 2020, explained by the short-cycle nature of demand for its products and services, which are exposed to cyclical swings in the economy. Organic revenue grew 1% year over year, supported by the execution of its healthy order backlog for mining equipment and aftermarket services, which was largely offset by its short-cycle machining segment. The daily order intake in the machining segment during the first two weeks of the fourth quarter remained consistent with the third quarter, and thus there appears to be no sign of a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. Shares are currently trading at a slight discount to our SEK 200, which we maintain. Geographically, the decline in order intake was most notable in South America and Asia, with only the Africa and Middle East segment reporting an increase in orders during the third quarter. Group EBITA margins were stable at 20.1% compared with the previous year. Higher pricing on its order backlog for mining equipment and a decline in freight costs both managed to offset declining profitability in its other operating segments due to lower demand. Sandviks restructuring program, implemented in 2022, has also managed to yield cost-savings and protected its profitability in a weak economic environment. Full-year capital expenditure guidance was raised from SEK 4.5 billion to between SEK 4.5 billion and SEK 5 billion.",Sandvik is able to utilize its  leading market position and close relationships with customers to gain a greater share of wallet as it expands its product offering into faster-growing segments.  The digitalization of Sandvik's large installed base of equipment will lower the group's cyclicality risk and boost profitability through a greater proportion of aftermarket sales.  A strong balance sheet allows for additional growth through mergers and acquisitions. ,"Sandvik's healthy balance sheet may see the group overpay for acquisitions to enhance the group's growth profile, given the structural headwinds of some of its end markets.  Sandviks machining solutions is exposed to the threat of higher adoption rates of fully electric vehicles that contain less steel content and thus require fewer cutting tools.  Sandvik has yielded significant cost saving initiatives to support profitability, and thus there are likely limited self-help initiatives remaining should a recession emerge. ",20/07/2023,"The short-cycle nature of demand for Sandviks metal-cutting tools and mining equipment exposes the group to cyclical swings in industrial manufacturing and commodity prices. A combination of divestments and restructuring has successfully created a more resilient and profitable business. The distribution of the materials technology segment to shareholders in the second half of 2022 has further reduced cyclicality due to the segments large concentration to energy-producing customers.  Sandvik is targeting 7% sales growth through the cycle, of which half will be generated from acquisitions. Sandviks balance sheet enjoys plenty capacity to invest, organically and through acquisitions, into growth areas such as additive manufacturing and the digitalization of its equipment to help offset structural headwinds from certain end markets. Acquisitions have served to enhance its product offering and expand into adjacent areas of the value chain, some of which have greater growth prospects than the traditional core business. The shift toward digital and autonomous technologies in the mining sector is a big opportunity for Sandvik to increase its aftermarket offerings that are less cyclical than equipment sales. We believe Sandviks mining equipment service capabilities, particularly around battery retrofits, are inferior to Epiroc. We do not anticipate acquisitions to detract from Sandviks investments into product innovation, which contributed to approximately 26% of 2022 revenue being generated from products younger than five years. Management has raised this target to between 30% and 35% by 2025, and thus investments into product innovation are likely to continue. Regular product innovation has supported superior market positions in many of Sandviks niche markets. We believe Sandviks leading market share across its machining and niche mining segments allows the company to utilize its existing close relationships with customers to gain a greater share of wallet as the group expands into adjacent areas. Recent cost-cutting programs have yielded large savings to protect profitability, and thus we assume further cost-saving opportunities are limited. ","We believe Sandvik has been able to carve out an economic moat primarily from its strong market position in niche applications in its mining and rock technology segment. While we are reluctant to award Sandviks machining solutions segment with a moat despite its strong presence in the metal cutting market, we think this business does not significantly detract from the companys attractive returns on invested capital. Recent divestments of low-margin/no-moat businesses that historically formed part of the mining division should raise the segment's profitability closer in line with its most direct competitor, Epiroc. This has helped contribute to Sandvik consistently earning returns on invested capital in the mid to high teens, well above its weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%.We assign a narrow moat to the mining and rock technology business where the company commands pricing power in many of its niche applications such as hard rock mining. Customers, which include the worlds largest mining companies, are willing to pay a premium for Sandviks record of reliability as well as the regular availability of spare parts and services resulting in a lower total cost of ownership. This is achieved through Sandviks worldwide service network stretching across 160 countries of its own employees, who are often situated in remote locations, which helps reduce the significant cost of equipment downtime. Sandviks on-the-ground presence, often permanently located on its customers' operations, also provides the company with a learning curve advantage for future product innovation. Given that much of Sandviks equipment is operated underground and is thus subject to large degrees of wear and tear, customers also place a greater emphasis on quality and safety in order to protect reputational damage. This record of reliability stretches back many decades with customers, which has resulted in Sandvik and Epiroc enjoying dominant positions in niche applications such as surface drilling, underground drilling, and underground loaders with combined market shares in certain niche segments at approximately 80%.We think the above-mentioned barriers to entry would deter not only new entrants but also larger mining equipment suppliers that operate in other areas of the mining value chain. We view it to be unlikely for these companies to allocate large sums of capital into R&D and upskilling its existing sales and service network, given the relatively small market size compared with their existing end markets. Sandvik has also followed a direct sales method, which has resulted in intimate client relationships that would be difficult for new entrants to break especially given the risk-averse nature of mining customers.The business has also increased its proportion of outsourced production, which is expected to allow the company to maintain strong profitability when commodity prices drop and demand for new equipment falls. In addition, aftermarket participation rates of approximately 50% on its installed base indicates characteristics of switching costs helping to protect profitability.We attribute the historical margin differential between Epiroc and Sandvik to be due to Sandviks product mix. Sandvik has had a more extensive product range that includes lower-margin offerings such as crushing and screening. The margin differential has narrowed since Sandvik has divested several noncore operations. We expect this to help contribute to Sandviks excess economic returns.Sandviks machining solutions enjoy a leading market position across its products such as round tools and inserts. Cutting tools represents a small share of manufacturing cost for customers but play an important role in improving productivity. Customers are therefore willing to pay a premium for reliability and Sandviks vast service network that minimizes production downtime. The companys record of regular product innovation and R&D through the cycle is impressive, which has supported premium pricing and superior profitability to peers. Sandvik has led its competitor Kennametal in terms of production methods and supply chain optimization, further contributing to industry-leading margins.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Sandvik is High. Sandviks customers operate in markets that are either affected by general economic conditions or face a high degree of cyclicality. Approximately 48% of Sandviks revenue is attributable to the mining industry, whose capital expenditure is based on the uncertain nature of commodity prices. Demand for products from Sandviks machining solutions segment is directly affected by global industrial production, which is dependent on the global economic environment. Furthermore, the segment is largely exposed to the automotive industry, where the structural shift toward electric vehicles requires fewer cutting tools due to lower steel content. The above-mentioned factors limit Sandviks ability to plan for the long term and provides limited visibility on financial performance, placing reliance on regular cost-saving initiatives. A combination of divestments and investments are intended to reduce the groups dependence on uncontrollable factors. Product governance is a potential area of environmental, social, and governance risk given the high cost of failure for Sandviks highly specialized mining equipment, which is used in harsh underground environments. Any quality defects could lead to disruptions and workplace accidents, which may in turn lead to compensation payments. We view product failure as unlikely given Sandviks strong track record for products engineered for safety and reliability. ","We assign Sandvik a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The group has ramped up the number of acquisitions as part of its shift toward a growth strategy, which has led to an increase in financial debt. Sandviks growth strategy targets half of the groups revenue growth to be from acquisitions, which introduces the risk of value-destructive acquisitions. Managements incentives are not tied to performance metrics that would mitigate the risk overpaying for acquisitions, such as the return on invested capital. We dont have any concerns on the groups balance sheet, which remains well below Sandviks debt threshold.It remains too early to judge the performance of Sandviks SEK 39 billion spending across 22 acquisitions between 2021 and the close of 2022, although we do expect the group's ROIC to return to the midteens by the end of our five-year forecast period. Acquisitions have focused on expanding its product offering to sectors with favorable growth outlooks and reducing the cyclicality of the business by expanding the group's aftermarket capabilities, which are less cyclical than the equipment business. Acquisitions related to manufacturing software have required paying high multiples. Historically, management has allocated capital effectively, reinvesting in the company and generating growth through acquisitions and product development. Approximately 26% of revenue in 2022 was generated from products younger than five years. Management has increased this target to be between 30% and 35%, incentivizing effective investment into product innovation. We remain impressed by managements response to weak periods of demand by adjusting production to ensure profitability and cash flow generation remains healthy throughout the cycle. The groups 50% dividend payout ratio is appropriate given the reinvestment opportunities the group enjoys.","Sandvik is a manufacturer of specialized tools and mining equipment used predominantly by global mining, engineering, and automotive customers. The companys core operations are in metal cutting and mining equipment. The company has a well-documented history, having been founded in 1862 and listed on the Nordic Exchange in Stockholm in 1901.Europe is the largest contributor to group sales at 27%, followed by North America 25%, Asia 19%, Australia 12%, Africa/Middle East 11%, and South America 6%.","Sandviks financial position is in a healthy state, even after spending SEK 15.5 billion on acquisitions across eight acquisitions in 2022. The group has net debt of SEK 42.6 billion, translating into a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, consistent with the groups target. A strong balance sheet provides comfort to shareholders given the cyclical nature of Sandvik's end markets and low visibility of demand. We forecast Sandvik will generate sufficient free cash flow growth and fall comfortably below its target debt ratio, even after paying out 50% of profits as dividends, leaving sufficient room for further growth acquisitions. However, we cannot fault a conservative balance sheet in a highly cyclical and working, capital-intensive industry.",SAND.ST,Industrials,262543835136.0,STO,198352.0,SEK,205.1999969482422,True,0,201.17758669798278,220.33855392272406,1
25/11/2023,"Suncorp's Insurance Profits Rising, With Outlook for Bank More Challenged",Suncorp Group Ltd,SUN,3,12/10/2023,Nathan Zaia,13.8,AUD,24/11/2023,13.5,High,,Standard,,12/10/2023,"The short-term outlook for Australian banks is challenging with margins under pressure, loan losses expected to rise, and inflationary cost pressures unable to be offset by cost-cutting initiatives. Industry returns on equity are suppressed, hence we expect loan and deposit-pricing changes in the medium term to lift margins to a level that allows wide-moat-rated major banks to generate returns above our 9% cost of equity. We think Westpac and ANZ Group are the best value of the majors. Commonwealth Bank shares underperformed major bank peers in the September quarter but remain expensive given industry-leading share and profitability. Bank of Queensland shares lifted modestly during the quarter but fell after its fiscal 2023 result, we think the market is too pessimistic on margins and costs beyond fiscal 2024. MyState is the cheapest name we cover. Despite material margin pressure, we think earnings growth will come from market share and cost-efficiency gains. ANZ Group continues to grow ahead of the market in home loans, with Westpacs quarterly performance a notable turnaround. The improvement is driven by price and cash-back offers, with broker approval process enhancements still in progress. Commonwealth Bank appears focused on margins over volumes. But we suspect if competition remains elevated, Commonwealth Bank will price to hold share. Major banks comfortably meet capital requirements with common equity Tier 1 ratios between 11.9% and 12.3%, well above the 10.25% minimum and top end of an 11.5% target. Banks are likely to take a conservative approach to balance sheet risk and capital management given the prevailing economic and regulatory uncertainty. Despite this, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank are buying back shares. For more details please see our Industry Pulse: Australian Banks 2023 Q3 published Oct. 12, 2023.","Premium increases stick without an equal rise in claims, and rising rates lift yields on fixed income, together lifting underlying profitability and dividends. A benign claims environment with a lower incidence of major catastrophes would considerably boost underwriting profits. Risk management has improved, and productivity initiatives are expected to deliver greater cost efficiencies.","In personal and commercial insurance, competition is increasing. Popular Australian brands and competitors from overseas are entering the general insurance distribution and underwriting markets. New competitors could pressure premiums and win market
share from incumbents, such as Suncorp. The bank's credit rating is lower than that of the highly rated major banks, resulting in higher wholesale funding costs and lower net interest margins. A higher incidence of large claims events from major catastrophes would crimp profitability. ",09/08/2023,"Suncorp is a well-capitalised financial services business with a dominant market position in the Australian and New Zealand general insurance industry and a regional banking franchise. In addition to offering insurance under the parent name, key brands in Australia include AAMI, GIO, Bingle, Apia, Shannons, and Terri Scheer. In New Zealand, key brands include Vero, AA Insurance, and Asteron Life. The insurer carries concentrated weather and earthquake risk in Australia and New Zealand and in particular Queensland, which makes up around 25% of gross written premiums in Australia.  The group's exposure to the Queensland market, where large natural peril events have been larger and more frequent, heightens the risks. Reinsurance protection mitigates risks to some extent, but can be expensive, particularly following large events.  After years of rising natural hazard costs, higher reinsurance costs, and claims inflation, profits are finally benefiting from price increases and higher investment income thanks to higher cash rates. Suncorps regional banking franchise is more concentrated than the major banks, with home loans making up around 80% of the loan book and Queensland accounts for more than half of loans. A smaller operating presence, higher funding and operational costs, and relatively limited product offerings have all led to lower margins relative to the majors. A sale of the bank to ANZ Bank would see capital returned to shareholders, but the deal is uncertain as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is against the transaction.  While there are potential benefits to the bancassurance model, such as better customer insights versus stand-alone insurance peers, and better cross-selling opportunities, they have not delivered a material tangible improvement in earnings, returns, or switching costs over a long period of time. Similar to its peers, Suncorp is focused on enhancing the digital offering to ensure simpler and faster quotes, claim processing, and to ensure the large insurer remains competitive on price. Productivity improvements remain a priority.","In general, property and casualty insurers do not benefit from favourable competitive positions because of fierce industry competition and commodity-like products. Customers generally wont pay a sizable premium for brand, and products are easily replicable, making the insurers cost structure the key differentiator. Many insurers do not know their cost of goods sold for years, allowing them to potentially underprice policies without knowing it. Firms have an incentive to chase growth at the expense of long-term profitability, given the cash comes in up front but the liabilities follow later, while competition can force insurers to match low prices or risk losing business. Insurers have two main sources of profitability: underwriting income (premiums minus operating costs) and float income or investment income. In our view, superior underwriting income is the only true source of a moat. We do not believe insurers can gain a maintainable advantage through investing, as higher returns are typically just reflective of higher risk or luck. Insurers need to be evaluated over long periods, as volatility is inherent to the industry.The Australian and New Zealand general insurance market is dominated by a handful of large players. Suncorp Groups over AUD 12 billion in gross written premiums makes it the second-largest. Insurance Australia Group's is the market leader, with QBE and Allianz followed by a long tail of much smaller players. In Australia around 27% of Suncorps premiums are generated from home and contents products, with motor and personal injury another 49%. In these categories we estimate Suncorps market share is higher. Size does come with some benefits, primarily it helps insurers lower costs by scaling their business through an effective distribution platform. In addition to sharing marketing, investment in technology and customer support, personal insurance lines also require less specialised underwriters. These benefits, as well as customer retention rates around 90% (lower in motor), have supported Suncorps combined operating ratio below 100% for 10 out of the last 10 years. This has not resulted in attractive returns though. Even with investment income on policy and shareholder funds, which is invested conservatively in cash and credit as opposed to growth assets, Suncorps return on equity has almost always trailed its cost of equity. Profit has continually been hampered by natural hazard claims in excess of allowances and a price taking regional bank. Over the last 10-years Suncorps claims loss ratio for Australia has averaged 72% versus Insurance Australia Groups average at 65%. While this is in part due to Suncorp having a lower weighting to home and contents which has lower claims experiences, it also reflects Suncorp exceeding natural hazard allowances more materially. Suncorps exposure to Queensland is also a contributor. Around 25% of the insurance portfolio is exposed to Queensland, compared with Insurance Australia Group, which has a less than 10% exposure in its consumer business.We do not believe the cost base or underwriting track record are enough to support a narrow economic moat rating. In fact, much smaller competitors have shown an ability to match Suncorps underwriting expense ratio (operating expenses/net earned premium) of 21%. Smaller competitors with narrower distribution focuses have successfully taking share profitably. Challenger brands have gone from less than 2% of the market in 2009 to around 10% today. A focus on lower risk customers could be contributing and limit the insurers ability to maintain current loss rates and grow share simultaneously. Auto clubs have increased their market share. While national insurers have sought to recoup large loss events on the east coast with higher premiums, geographically focused auto clubs in Western Australia and Tasmania have benefited from a pricing advantage. Low claims expense ratios lead us to conclude competitors are not taking additional risk. However, just as regional exposure has worked in their favour in recent times, a severe weather event in that state would impact their ability to maintain market leading prices. We do not believe owning a large global insurer and a bank provide adequate cross-sell synergies nor create adequate customer switching costs to support a moat rating. Suncorps regional banking franchise does not have an economic moat rating in isolation either. The bank lacks maintainable cost advantages and switching costs required under Morningstars global bank moat framework. Suncorp Bank is the seventh-largest bank in Australia with around 2% market share of total loans, trailing considerably behind the major four that collectively have more than 75% share. Its share of total deposits is even smaller at 1%. The inability to compete on price, due to higher funding and operational costs, has translated to lower returns on equity relative to the majors. Suncorp Banks loan book is mainly geared toward residential mortgages in Queensland, where property prices and confidence have lagged behind the key markets of New South Wales and Victoria. The low-rate environment and competitive lending landscape means it will be difficult for Suncorp Bank to lift loan rates independently of the major banks.","Key risks include unexpected increases in underlying claims and natural peril costs above reinsurance allowances. Investment returns on policyholder and shareholder funds make up a sizable component of earnings, leaving the business vulnerable to changes in equity market and fixed-income returns. In a dire situation, debt issuer defaults from Suncorps investments are possible, which negatively affect earnings but also could also necessitate a dilutive equity raising. We believe taking all these factors into consideration makes a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High most appropriate.The bank's profitability could be undermined by aggressive lending practices to drive loan growth, with rising unemployment another potential catalyst for rising bad debts. Failure to keep pace with changes in customer demands, such as product innovation, could result in the bank losing share. A tougher stance by regulators in monitoring and enforcement of compliance increases the risk of penalties and customer remediation costs.Suncorp's environmental, social, and governance risks primarily relate to climate change, which could increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. We think insurers can increase premiums to offset higher costs though, as all competitors will be facing the same margin headwinds. We, therefore, don't incorporate ESG risks into our base case. For the bank, risks primarily relate to breaches of law and regulatory requirements, unfair treatment of customers, protection of customer data, and lending exposure to environmental and socially sensitive sectors. In our view, the combined probability and materiality of these ESG-related risks is small relative to the cash flows of the bank, and we make no specific allowances in our forecasts.","We assign Suncorp a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. Suncorp Group is in good financial health. Sitting on excess capital provides a buffer for unforeseen insurance and bad debt events. We think the investment strategy, which focuses on marketing key brands, managing loss ratios, and driving digital sales and service capabilities, is rational in a competitive and commoditised insurance market. We view Suncorps target dividend payout ratio of 60%-80% cash earnings (excluding special dividends) to be reasonable. Suncorp has paid a number of special dividends and made a capital return in 2020, and while we expect some of the current surplus capital will be returned to shareholders, we dont think it will put the balance sheet at risk. After a period of trying to push the Suncorp brand nationally, management has reinvigorated the multibrand strategy, which we like. A refreshed marketing strategy will push the value proposition of each brand in different regions and segments, which we believe should help Suncorp hold its market share. Suncorp has made a number of divestments recently which we view positively, freeing up capital and helping narrow the group's focus on its core insurance and banking operations. Suncorp sold the life business to TAL Dai-Ichi for AUD 725 million. The sale completed late February 2019 with approximately AUD 610 million of net the sale proceeds returned to shareholders via a special dividend and capital return. Suncorp entered into a 20-year distribution agreement with TAL. In late 2019, Suncorp completed the sale of its smash and repair business, Capital S.M.A.R.T, and its auto-parts business, ACM Parts. The gain on sale on these transaction totalled AUD 293 million. In April 2021 Suncorp entered an agreement to sell its Australia wealth business, Suncorp Portfolio Services. Wealth contributed no profit in fiscal 2020 and the sale for AUD 45 million provided a clean exit.The proposed sale of Suncorp Bank is another step in management's journey of simplifying and narrowing the strategic focus. With uncertainty around the cash rate outlook (affecting NIM and bad debts) and wage inflation, locking in the upside via the bank sale takes away execution and economic risks for Suncorp shareholders. The sale implies a price/book of 1.3 times net tangible assets, a significant premium to current market prices of nonmajor banks. The transaction is no certainty, though, with the ACCC opposed to the deal.","Suncorp is a Queensland-based financial services conglomerate offering retail and business banking, general insurance, superannuation, and investment products in Australia and New Zealand. It also operates a life insurance business in New Zealand. The core businesses include personal insurance, commercial insurance, Vero New Zealand, and Suncorp Bank. Suncorp and competitors IAG Insurance and QBE Insurance dominate the Australian and New Zealand insurance markets.","Suncorp Group is in good financial health. As at June 30, Suncorp Insurance had a prescribed capital amount multiple of 1.63 times the regulatory minimum. The common equity Tier 1 ratio for the insurance business was 1.16 times after the final dividend payment, within the target range of 1.075-1.375 times the PCA. The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio as at June 30 was 10.1% after the final dividend, within Suncorp's 10%-10.5% target. In addition to both the bank and insurance divisions being within target ranges, Suncorp also has AUD 274 million of CET1 capital at the group level. Suncorp targets a dividend payout of 60%-80% cash earnings (excluding special dividends).",SUN.AX,Financial Services,17847152640.0,ASX,2445920.0,AUD,13.739999771118164,True,0,13.321727358060919,14.19154958027927,1
25/11/2023,Antas Rich Brand Portfolio Paves the Way for Sales and Margin Expansion,ANTA Sports Products Ltd,02020,4,18/10/2023,Ivan Su,81.25,HKD,24/11/2023,141.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,18/10/2023,"We maintain our HKD 141 fair value estimate for narrow-moat-rated Anta after its 2023 investor day reinforced our positive long-term thesis. Anta offered upbeat financial targets for the next three years, including midteens annual revenue growth which is slightly ahead of our forecasts. The firm expects its Fila business to grow at double digits annually, which we are skeptical about, but the focus on expanding the brand's addressable market is positive. Management also reiterated its plan to improve long-term margins for Anta but stopped short of providing a near-term outlook of profitability following the recent signing of Kyrie Irving. We continue to see shares as undervalued for long-term investors. We believe the market is underappreciating the group's opportunity within the premium outdoor segments, where we expect higher growth over the next three years and which should drive up share price performance. At the outset of the presentation, management emphasized the growing trend among consumers to opt for high-end aspirational products while seeking savings on everyday commoditized items, resulting in an increasing polarization of spending. In response to this shifting consumer demand and to drive sales growth, Anta has updated its strategies for each of its four main brands. For its namesake Anta brand, the goal is to solidify its mass-market position, providing more functional value without raising prices. We find this to be a sensible approach and anticipate that the brand will capture a larger market share in the coming years. Regarding Fila, the emphasis remains on targeting China's mid-to-high-end consumers. However, driving incremental sales may prove more challenging, as the brand now needs to expand into the performance category while simultaneously defending its market share in sports fashion.","Recent introduce of premium product lines under the core Anta brand can lead to more margin expansion for the group Chinese per capital sportswear spending is still a fraction of most developed countries, and rising health awareness will continue to drive overall activewear sales.  The acquisition of Kingkow provides the company with optionality to enter the premium kidswear market in China.","The nature of Fila makes it subject to fashion misses, and it takes time to prove the brand can remain relevant in the years to come. Fast-fashion brands are rushing into the sportswear space by providing low-cost options that compete directly with Antas core brand. Acquiring nonsportswear brands that fall outside of the companys comfort zone carries additional risks. Acquisition valuations may be at a premium and reinventions may be harder than expected.",23/08/2023,"We believe that Anta's multibrand portfolio, which covers a range of consumer segments from mass-market to ultra-premium, provides an opportunity for the company to capture a growing share of the flourishing sportswear market. As China's largest homegrown sportswear brand, Anta initially established a reputation for value-for-money products targeted at the midmarket. However, the group's core Anta brand, which contributes to approximately 50% of total revenue, is now expanding its reach in lower-tiered Chinese cities as a reasonably-priced alternative to more expensive international brands such as Nike and Adidas. With economic growth and improving affordability in China, we believe Anta will benefit as consumers trade up from lower-end domestic alternatives to its products, while a portion of its customers will eventually trade up to costlier brands. Anta's acquisition of Fila China in 2009 as part of its multibrand strategy has proven successful, granting the company access to the premium market. Fila has achieved a revenue CAGR of approximately 35% from 2017 to 2022, now contributing more than 40% of the group's top line. However, demand for its products is nearing saturation, and Fila's products are almost entirely sold direct to consumers, allowing the brand to retain firm control over products and shopping experiences, bolstering brand equity. Anta further diversified its geographic exposure with the acquisition of Amer Sports, a Finnish sporting goods conglomerate known for brands such as Wilson, Arc'teryx, Solomon, and 12 other sports equipment brands. Anta's management is leveraging its expertise in sourcing and retail distribution to deliver sales and supply chain cost synergies for the Amer brands. We believe this acquisition demonstrates Anta's strategy of acquiring brands with a minimal presence in China at the time of acquisition. With a multibrand portfolio, Anta covers consumer segments that associate the core Anta brand with affordability, allowing the company to appeal to a broad range of consumers. ","We assign Anta a narrow economic moat based on intangible assets for its demonstrated brand strength, as evidenced by average return on invested capital, or ROIC, of almost 50% from 2011 to 2021. For comparison, wide-moat Nikes midcycle ROIC is around 30% while narrow-moat Adidas is around 16%. We still believe a strong brand intangible asset will allow Anta to achieve ROICs above the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, for at least a decade. We project ROIC to average 67% over the next five years, significantly above our 8.5% WACC assumption. Over the past 10 years, the company raised its market share from around 5% to 15%, third behind Nike and Adidas respective 26% and 17% shares of the Chinese sportswear market. The company has a portfolio of more than a dozen brands, but two of these brandsAnta and Filagenerate almost all of the companys revenue.The core Anta brand, which encompasses both Anta Adults and Kids, generates about half of total group revenue and had an estimated revenue CAGR of around 19% between 2017 and 2021. In 2016 Interbrand ranked Antas core brand as one of the Best China Brands for the eighth year in a row. Fila, on the other hand, makes up roughly 44% of the groups sales. The sportswear companys returns on invested capital have been boosted by the acquisition of high-end sports fashion brand Fila in 2009. Anta owns 85% of Fila China (includes Hong Kong and Macao), with product designing, marketing, and pricing rights in the region.The group's strong margins demonstrate its pricing power. We view gross margin as one of the most critical metrics reflecting Antas brand strength, as it indicates both the pricing power and ability to sell products at full price. The company enjoyed an overall gross margin of 62% in 2021, higher than all major domestic peers, whose gross margins hover around 40%. Anta managed to improve its gross margin from 38% in 2012 to 62% in 2021 through implementing a tighter inventory management system and the successful turning around its Fila acquisition. As in many other parts of the world, athleisure is a growing trend in China. To capitalize on the trend, Anta spent CNY 400 million in 2009 to acquire losing-making Fila from Belle. Targeting Chinas high-end sportswear market, Fila generated more than CNY 21 billion in revenue during 2021. Unlike Antas core brand, the Fila brand has higher margins because the products are priced at a premium and are predominantly sold direct-to-consumer. As Anta continues to adopt direct-to-consumer model for its acquired brands, we see fewer markdowns on products that will lead to more stable gross margins in the next five years.The gross margin strength also flows through to the operating margin level with Antas 2021 operating margin of 22%higher than that of most domestic and international peers global operations. Prior to the Xinjiang cotton controversy, Nike and Adidas all saw strong China operating margins in the mid-30s and high-20s, respectively.Anta spent CNY 6 billion (12% of sales) to market its products in 2021. Although this percentage is generally in line with peers, we believe its status as the largest domestic player enables the company to better leverage its marketing spending relative to its domestic peers. The firm is also developing its recognition for innovation and performance by focusing more on the functionality of its products. Anta established the first sports science laboratory in China, and its research and development expense as a percentage of sales has risen to 2.3% in 2021 from just 1.8% in 2010. We think this spending will enable Anta to consistently come to market with innovative offerings aligned with consumer trends and enhance its pricing power.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Anta is High. The firm operates in a competitive industry where international sportswear giantsnamely Nike, Adidas, Lululemon and moreare all attempting to gain market share in the lucrative Chinese market. More specifically, we are worried that Fila might not be able to retain its current market share over an extended period of time. The reason Fila became phenomenal in China is that the brand found a fine line between fashion-forward designs and a comfort-oriented feel, a market that was underserved. Admittedly, several global sportswear brands already share some of the elements behind Filas success, but none dedicated solely to the sports fashion space. But we are seeing early signs of of a pick-up in competition. Xtep, together with Hillhouse, is positioning the K-Swiss brand as the first major head-on challenger to Fila in China. To us, where K-Swiss sits today closely resembles where Fila was in the early 2010s. Like Fila, K-Swiss is also a brand with a rich history, with strong roots in tennis, and is also viewed as a new but somewhat familiar brand in the eyes of Chinese consumers. But because fashion trends are constantly changing and being redefined, it is too early to say whether K-Swiss will become a formidable competitor to Fila, but we think it certainly has the potential to emerge as a serious rival. That being said, we do not expect Filas competitive pressure (from K-Swiss) to increase over the next few years as K-Swiss wont start opening a direct-to-consumer store in China until rebranding is completed in early 2022. We do not believe Anta's environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks to be material. However, like most apparel and shoes manufacturers, it faces potential criticism regarding the wages and human rights of workers in its supply chain.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Anta is Standard. For years, Anta had an excellent track record of acquisitions, a solid balance sheet, and a history of consistently returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. However, recent corporate decisions, including the $1.5 billion share issuance in early 2023, despite a strong net cash position, have been questionable. Our current Standard rating reflects our belief that Anta possesses a sound balance sheet, and an exceptional record of investments, but poor shareholder distributions.Anta clearly holds a sound balance sheet with low levels of risk regarding the size of the debt carried, the business cyclicality facing the firm, and the debt maturity outlook. While an argument could be made to increase the leverage of the balance sheet to be more active in investing, we believe the company (along with other firms in the industry) should hold ample balance sheet strength to support opportunistic acquisitions.Turning to investments, we continue to believe Anta is operating at an exceptional level. Management has a clear plan for the Anta brand, which is to target Chinese middle-market consumers who find international name brands to be overly expensive. Unlike domestic competitors such as Li-Ning which are trying to become the ""Nike of China,"" the Anta brand continues to focus on its core competencies by targeting middle-market customers. Sticking to this strategy has yielded great results for the company, as it recorded solid sales growth over the past decade and remains the largest domestic sportswear brand in China. The company's strategy of using acquisitions to break into the high-end market segment has also been successful. It acquired the loss-making Fila China from Belle and reinvented the brand into a growth driver that contributes to almost half of the group's revenue. The company's success with Fila gives us confidence in its ability to revamp several other acquired brands by re-introducing them to Chinese audiences.Finally, we view Anta's shareholder distribution philosophy as poor. Up till 2017, Anta has had a solid record of returning cash to shareholders but slashed its dividend payout by about 25% in 2018 and has yet to return to the 60%-plus payout that we view as appropriate. Moreover, the group's recent questionable equity issuance further undermines our confidence in management's ability to make proper capital allocation decisions. As of the end of 2022, Anta was in a net cash position of CNY 15 billion, but despite that, management decided to raise another CNY 11 billion through equity issuance in April 2023. Overall, we would like to see the company distributes more capital to shareholders before rewarding it a more favorable capital allocation rating. ","Anta Sports is the largest Chinese sportswear company, engaging in the design, manufacturing, and marketing of sportswear. Brands under Antas management include the Anta core brand, Fila, Descente, Sprandi, Kolon, and KingKow. As of the end of 2020, the company had 12,260 stores, of which 9,922 were Anta stores and 2,006 were Fila stores. ","We think Anta is in strong financial health. The company had CNY 25 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of 2021. Even with its Amer acquisition, Anta should remain in good financial standing. We project the companys EBIT/interest expense to run at 20-40 times over the next few years, assuming the company keeps some debt on its balance sheet. We expect the companys future free cash flow yield to remain healthy, averaging 3.3% over the next five years. Our forecast has taken into consideration the groups capital expenditure for the building of its logistics centers and various investments related to acquired brands. We expect Anta's acquisition appetite to diminish, with the Amer acquisition to be digested. We still expect the company will use excess cash to pay dividends. Prior to the Amer acquisition, Anta maintained a recurring dividend payout ratio of around 60%. The company started paying special dividends in 2012, which brought the total dividend payout ratio for the pre-Amer years to around 70%. However, given the challenges brought by COVID-19 outbreak in China, we forecast the total dividend payout ratio to drop below 40% in 2022 before returning to around 50% in 2023.",2020.HK,Consumer Cyclical,214995861504.0,HKG,14924011.0,HKD,83.4000015258789,True,1,87.12394695972047,73.98642024288148,0

As expected, results remained quite messy with multiple one-time charges, and an impairment charge of CAD 45 million is forecast for next quarter. Excluding the impact of Bank of the West, adjusted preprovision pretax income would have been down 4% year over year. As we have seen with peers, the environment in Canada remains more constructive than in the United States. The U.S. segment's net interest margin was down once again, while Canadian NIM and preprovision pretax income were both up sequentially. We do not expect the pressure in the U.S. to completely abate, although if the Federal Reserve refrains from further interest-rate hikes, the pressure should ease over the next quarter or two. Management struck a positive tone on the call about realizing additional revenue synergies, although in our experience these types of synergies are notoriously difficult to pin down. The bank took some severance-related charges in the quarter, which it expects will lead to savings of roughly CAD 250 million by early 2025. It also made some moves on its real estate footprint, which are expected to lead to savings of CAD 400 million. Combined, this should be another roughly 3% savings on the current expense run rate. The bank expects to achieve positive operating leverage in 2024, which we were already expecting, even on an adjusted basis. Because results are largely tracking our expectations, with the main difference being the one-time severance charges, we are maintaining our CAD 136/$100 fair value estimate. Results will remain a bit messy for now, but we expect the expense picture to improve throughout 2024 and into early 2025.","Growth and opportunities in the bank's U.S. markets will outweigh any slowdown in its native Canada as U.S. subsidiaries gain market share. Compared with its peers, BMO has a lower exposure to the Canadian housing market. BMO's presence in the Canadian ETF market should pay off as passive investment options gain share in Canada over the next decade.","The housing market in Canada is starting to heat up again, increasing potential risks for the economy and the banking sector. BMO's acquisition of Bank of the West increases execution risks and has created messy quarterly results which require a lot of adjustments that can be difficult to interpret. Higher interest rates and rising amortization periods for mortgages show the Canadian consumer is set to come under increased strain for the foreseeable future.",01/06/2023,"Bank of Montreal is the fourth-largest bank in Canada and one of six Canadian banks that collectively hold almost 90% of the nation's banking deposits. The bank derives roughly 60% of its revenue from Canada and 30% from the United States. BMO has a well-established Canadian banking presence, an established U.S. retail operation in the Midwest, and growing commercial and capital markets capabilities. It is also the second-largest asset manager among the Canadian banks as well as the second-largest ETF provider in Canada. BMO is not one of the largest or most dominant retail banks in Canada, as we rank it in the lower half of the Big Six. However, with its more commercially focused book, it boasts good share in its domestic commercial lending market, particularly for loans under CAD 25 million. Additionally, BMO has the lowest relative exposure to residential mortgage loans among its peers, helping to mitigate some of the risks in its loan book, although a true housing crisis could cause a recession and hurt commercial loans indirectly. Over the past several years, BMO has been building its commercial lending strength in the U.S., although we expect the consistent double-digit loan growth to eventually slow. In general, we like BMOs presence in the U.S., as it has built up respectable deposit market share numbers, generated material growth, and avoided some of the mistakes other Canadian banks have made in attempts to expand south. The bank's acquisition of Bank of the West closed at the beginning of February 2023. BMO has the second-largest amount of assets under management among the Canadian banks, with the largest proportion of its revenue coming from wealth-management fees among peers, close to 20%. We like the growth and results the bank has achieved here. Competing against BlackRock in exchange-traded funds will likely get more difficult, and RBC's latest partnership with BlackRock shows that competition will get tougher, however, we expect passive to continue to grow in Canada, supporting future growth for the industry in general.","With above-average historical operating efficiency, moaty nonbank businesses, and the ability to primarily operate in the favorable Canadian banking environment, BMO is worthy of a narrow moat rating, in our view. We award the bank a narrow moat rating rather than a wide moat rating because of its greater exposure to U.S. banking, which we view as less moaty than the Canadian operations, as well as its less dominant market positions within its own domestic market (where it has gradually lost share over the past decade to the larger Canadian banks).We argue that bank moats are derived primarily from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. We see switching costs within the Canadian system as driven by a tightly regulated oligopolistic market structure that limits excess competition, thereby stabilizing product pricing and giving customers less incentive to switch banks. We see cost advantages as stemming from three primary factors: a low-cost deposit base, excellent operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting, with regulatory costs being a final factor that must also be considered. We view the Canadian banking environment as offering systemic cost advantages for the banks under its domain. These advantages manifest in the form of lower operating costs, lower credit costs, lower regulatory costs, and lower absolute levels of and better diversification of risks, all of which allow the banks to achieve greater risk-adjusted returns.In our view, Bank of Montreal has a narrow moat because it has substantial, but not top, market share in the advantageous Canadian banking environment, slightly above-average operating efficiency over the long term, and exposures to several moaty nonbank businesses. Bank of Montreal does have fairly good share in the domestic commercial banking business, at number two for loans under CAD 25 million. However, for many of the other banking products in Canada, BMO is not usually the number-one or number-two player. Since the bank is slightly less dominant here, we believe it is more supportive of a narrow moat rating, rather than wide.Bank of Montreal had consistently operated with an average efficiency ratio for a Canadian bank, although in recent years this has not been the case due to several factors, including acquisitions, a legal settlement, and increased investment. We believe BMO will eventually return to operating efficiency that is closer to average, and while we dont expect the firm to be one of the most efficient Canadian banks, we do expect current investments in digital to pay off and some relief around increased regulatory expenses to dissipate and firmly support a narrow moat rating.BMO also has exposure to more moaty nonbank businesses, most notably its asset-management operations. Asset managers with scale tend to have moats, and BMO has the second-largest amount of AUM among the Canadian banks, and is the second-largest ETF provider in Canada (which tends to be a pure scale business). While BMOs focus on the ETF business gives it lower overall spreads, the scale advantage should endure and lead to excess returns on capital for a business that is not capitally intense. While BlackRock is the number-one player in Canada with nearly 50% of the ETF market, we see room for both players, even if BlackRock remains dominant. We believe the Canadian banking environment offers systemic cost advantages leading to returns above the cost of capital, allowing the main banks operating under its jurisdiction to possess moats. Barriers to entry for the Canadian banking system are very high. Existing regulations prevent foreign competition, as non-Canadian residents may not own more than 25% of the shares of a bank unless approved by the government (preventing foreign takeover), and foreign banks can only operate in Canada under certain restrictions (preventing significant direct foreign competition). Domestic competition is also controlled, as Canadas banking system historically developed to favor a few large banks controlling the majority of the domestic market, and this is actively enforced through the handling of chartering by the federal government exclusively. Additionally, the rejection of merger proposals in 1998 between Royal Bank of Canada and BMO, and between Toronto Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, created a precedent where the regulators will accept no further consolidation between the main Canadian banks. Having larger banks helps to spread out fixed costs across a larger operating base, increasing operating efficiency, as the four largest Canadian banks are all bigger than the largest U.S. regional bank. Because their branch networks are spread out through all of Canada, the Canadian banks arguably have some of the most powerful distribution networks within Canada. This offers cost advantages via lower customer acquisition costs. In addition, the banks are involved in nearly every major financial product, including asset management, wealth management, insurance, investment banking, and a variety of other consumer and commercial banking products and services. Bigger scale, powerful distribution networks, a multitude of products, and diversification of business lines lead to economies of scope in addition to the economies of scale already achieved.We believe a more protective and efficient regulatory system also leads to cost advantages, primarily through risk reduction. Less fragmented and well-integrated banking systems, like the Canadian system, have tended to be more stable over time, reducing risk. Also, the Canadian regulators must only primarily monitor and develop relationships with the Big Six Canadian banks, which is much easier than trying to monitor the thousands of banks which exist in the U.S., for example. This leads to more collaboration and cooperation between regulators and banks, as well as greater institutional memory and better-coordinated and more easily implemented responses if strains begin to appear in the system. Regulators also help to control pricing in the market at times, such as with mortgage products, helping to reduce the potential for pricing wars to gain market share at the expense of underwriting standards. Canadian regulation also makes it more difficult for bad credit to be issued in many ways, including mandatory insurance and standards on riskier mortgage loans, not having a government-sponsored enterprise like the government-subsidized mortgage securitization market, and forcing banks to hold more of the risk on their own balance sheets. These factors help contribute to better absolute risk reduction in the system, as well as regulatory economies of scale.The Canadian banks are also more geographically diversified on average than, for example, the majority of U.S. regional banks, which often have concentrations within individual states or local economies. This diversifies credit risk, lowering the overall risk for each individual bank. Canadas system of higher taxes, social safety nets, and undoubtedly other complex factors has also led to a more robust and stable middle class, which contributes to economic and political stability, further reducing systemic risk.With all of these factors combined, along with explicit government subsidies on deposit insurance and mortgage insurance, as well as the implicit subsidy of being too big to fail domestically (all of the Big Six Canadian banks are labeled as domestic systematically important banks), we see an environment where excess returns for banks are almost certain to exist in Canada.","Canadian banks face two primary risks: macroeconomic risks and risks related to future acquisitions. Canada has some of the highest median housing price/annual median household income ratios in several of its major housing markets, and mortgage debt levels have consistently increased for more than a decade. While low interest rates have kept debt-servicing ratios under control, this puts the economy in a riskier position as rates rise. We also see the leverage of the Canadian consumer as a risk, as consumers have slowly leveraged up for more than a decade. Bank of Montreal has one of the smallest exposures to the domestic real estate market in Canada, and we view this as a manageable risk for the bank.While there are uncertainties related to consumer debt levels and the mortgage market, we view them as a threat to future growth and not an existential risk to the Canadian banking system. Further, the Canadian banking system has historically been one of the more stable systems in the world, and is designed to protect industry profit levels and promote economic stability. As such, we assign our Canadian banks a Low Uncertainty Rating. We admit, with the rising mortgage risks, the banks are closer to Medium today than they were previously.From an ESG perspective, commercial banks are expected to have strong product governance. Predatory or discriminatory lending practices are examples of poor product governance, and this can affect certain banks at times. We view most product governance and social risks as manageable and incorporate a steady level of operational expenses related to compliance and litigation in our models. Outside of the rare, headline-grabbing scandals, we dont see social risks as having a material effect on our valuation. Banks also lend to certain sectors which can come under more scrutiny at times. Commercials banks dont directly have a large environmental footprint and governance practices are in line with most companies.","We give BMO a Standard capital allocation rating. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are standard, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We view the bank's current goal of 11%-11.5% as appropriate. We rate the company's capital investments as standard, as the bank has avoided value destroying products and expansions while pursuing sensible investments and growth opportunities. And we assess the companys capital return strategy, which is largely in line with peers, as appropriate, with a healthy focus on a dividend, and some additional earnings left over for share repurchases, after internal investments. Darryl White has been CEO since 2017. BMO, which had been shuffling around different senior management members, moved White to the COO spot in November 2016, signaling that he was the heir apparent to then-CEO Bill Downe. White has been with the bank since 1994 and has held many roles, including group head of the capital markets segment and CEO of BMO Nesbitt Burns, the Canadian wealth management arm of BMO.With White as CEO, we have seen a consistent focus on strengthening already-sizable U.S. operations; continued emphasis on the commercial operations of the business, digital and efficiency initiatives; and a further expansion of the ETF business. We've also seen a shoring up of the capital markets group with management changes and multiple acquisitions. Historically, we think the firm has done a good job of making acquisitions, particularly in expanding the U.S. business.We like that BMO has established respectable market shares in key areas in the U.S., and as such has remained profitable in these operations. The successful acquisition of M&I Bank in Milwaukee in 2011 added nearly $50 billion in assets, along with $162 billion in assets under management and administration, furthering multiple strategic objectives for BMO. We also like how the firm has taken advantage of its distribution strength and successfully expanded its wealth-management groups, while shedding its EMEA asset management segment where it lacked the necessary scale. While the firm is not among the most dominant of the retail Canadian banks, returns have consistently exceeded the cost of capital. Acquisitions have remained a key use of excess capital for BMO, and this could continue, although management has emphasized that it is pursuing organic growth first. With respect to the dividend, BMO was the last of the major Canadian banks to begin increasing it after the crisis and has now increased it multiple times since 2012. BMO did have to restate its own capital levels in 2016 after underestimating the amount of risk-weighted assets held on the balance sheet. It has since rebuilt its capital levels, and we believe the bank is well positioned to continue returning capital to shareholders or make further bolt-on acquisitions, and we think the acquisition of Bank of the West is likely to add additional growth for the bank.","Bank of Montreal is a diversified financial-services provider based in North America, operating four business segments: Canadian personal and commercial banking, U.S. P&C banking, wealth management, and capital markets. The bank's operations are primarily in Canada, with a material portion also in the U.S.","We see BMO as being in strong overall financial health and do not believe any potential future issues will be an existential risk to the bank. Given how leveraged the Canadian consumer appears to be, we expect that loan demand will remain modest, while risks will remain heightened. We are also concerned about a potential deflation of the housing bubble in Canada and the impact on Canadian banks. BMO has one of the smallest relative exposures to uninsured mortgages among the Big Six banks as a percentage of the total loan book, and as a percentage of tangible equity. In the event of a major downturn, we see the bank being able to deal with the fallout, although growth will decline and the damage will likely spread to the whole economy, damaging future earnings.The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% as of April 2023. In general, we find the bank's capital levels satisfactory with the targeted range of roughly 11.5% or more being appropriate. With dividend payout ratios at manageable levels between 40% and 50% under normal circumstances, we expect BMO's capital generation will continue to provide growth in its capital position, leaving room for future bolt-on acquisitions, increased capital return to shareholders, or both.",BMO.TO,Financial Services,81938522112.0,TOR,3283878.0,CAD,110.20999908447266,True,1,110.44401677449406,124.34855502989755,1
25/11/2023,Victrex Is a Global Leader in High-Performance Plastics,Victrex PLC,VCT,4,12/09/2023,Rob Hales,1515.0,GBP,23/11/2023,2000.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,12/09/2023,"In 2022, battery electric vehicles represented nearly 10% of global auto sales, up from a little less than 6% in 2021. Much of the growth occurred in China, which has been a leader in EV sales over the past decade. However, with national EV subsidies in China expiring in 2022 and far lower sales in the U.S. and Europe, the market questions if EV sales can continue to grow without subsides. The growth can and will continue. By 2030, we forecast EVs will account for 40% of global auto sales. While EVs will still cost more upfront for most auto categories, we expect falling battery costs will drive cost parity on a total cost of ownership basis over the next couple of years in the majority of autos. Consumer function concerns are rapidly disappearing. As EVs have reached range parity with internal combustion engines and charge times have fallen, the buildout of chargers across highways and in cities throughout the world will drive higher EV sales even without subsidies. We see strong opportunities for investors throughout the EV supply chain. While multiple companies will benefit from rising EV sales, our top picks are largely based on valuation. Our top automaker picks are General Motors and BYD. For auto suppliers, our top pick is BorgWarner. Batteries, which are needed in all EVs, will see strong growth. Our top pick is Samsung SDI. In technology, semiconductors and components will benefit from increased content per vehicle. Our top picks are Infineon for automotive-related semiconductors and Sensata for components. In materials, lithium is our preferred resource as lithium is the vital resource needed in all EV batteries. Albemarle is our top pick. Outside of lithium, copper, cobalt, and nickel should all see rising demand, and we like Glencore. Specialty chemicals will see increased content per vehicle. Our top pick is Celanese. In EV charging, ChargePoint is our top pick, while we like Edison International for charging infrastructure.","Victrex is making progress moving downstream in the PEEK value chain, which should help protect margins as the upstream business becomes more competitive. The company has several GBP 50 million sales opportunities in its medical development pipeline, which should invigorate segment growth in the long term. Given the companys significant free cash flow and shareholder-friendly capital-allocation policies, investors have the potential to realise extra returns through special dividends.","Key competitor Solvay has invested heavily in expanding its PEEK capacity. Increasing competition may reduce profitability for all industry participants. Victrex is well penetrated into the mature market for spine fusion cages in the United States. Consequently, growth will probably be limited until new markets and products are developed. Progress in the company's innovation pipeline continues but it may be several years before this has a material impact on the company's overall performance. ",07/07/2023,"U.K.-based Victrex is the creator of and dominant market leader in polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, a lightweight ultra-high-performance plastic that suits the most demanding applications in transportation, oil and gas, and electronics. It serves these industrial markets through its industrials segment, which accounts for around 80% of sales. The company has broadened applications of PEEK to healthcare, notably implantable spinal fusion cages. Healthcare sales are housed in the medical segment, which contributes the other 20% of sales, but has higher margins than the industrial business.  Total market demand for PEEK is small, currently around 6,000 metric tons per year. Victrex has succeeded in its efforts to expand the market for PEEK, as evidenced by mid-single-digit volume growth at the company over the past decade. We think the market for PEEK has plenty of room to grow by capturing increasing demand for metal-replacement products. Indeed, the company believes annual demand for PEEK could ultimately grow to 80,000 metric tons, a reasonable view given that the market size for many specialty polymers is 2-3 times larger. While PEEK has been off-patent for many years, competition has been benign with only a handful of suppliers entering the market. Competitive dynamics are evolving slowly. Solvay made a significant capacity expansion a few years ago, but this is the only company that has made real inroads into the market. We think there is room for both Victrex and Solvay to be major players without serious price competition. The company's strategy is shifting to prioritise moving downstream into semifinished and finished products and specialty applications, in order to capture a larger portion of profits in the value chain. Currently, these products account for about 30% of sales. Victrexs pipeline of downstream products under development could easily double current sales, but a material impact on group profit is probably several years away.","We think Victrex has a narrow moat based on switching costs. The company has peer-leading operating margins of around 40% in recent years. Returns on invested capital have averaged 30% over the past decade and only dropped below 20% during the financial crisis. We expect ROICs to remain above 20% in our forecast period.Victrex is the market leader in PEEK, an ultra-high-performance plastic used in a wide variety of applications for the automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, electronics, and healthcare markets. PEEK generates the vast majority of sales for Victrex, with non-PEEK sales coming from related plastic (polymer) products. Most of the companys business is industrial-focused, which falls in the industrial segment. The company separates its implantable medical device business into the medical segment, as it has a significantly higher price point and gross margin. The industrial segment contributes 80% of group sales with gross margins around 55%-60%, while the medical segment generates 20% of sales with gross margins near 90%. PEEK was invented by Victrex in 1978, when it was a part of ICI Chemicals, and was granted a patent in 1982. The product has been off-patent for more than a decade, but competition has remained limited, given the small market size and switching costs arising from its use in the most demanding applications. Indeed, PEEK is known as the highest-performing polymer in the world for its unique combination of properties including strength, durability, temperature/chemical resistance, and light weight. As such, its primarily used as a metal replacement. We estimate Victrex has a 65% market share by capacity. There are four other major competitors in the market--Solvay, Evonik, and two private Chinese companies--although Solvay is the only one of notable size, with market share around 20%. PEEK is tailored to customers needs, given that is used for ultra-high-performance applications. The tailored product provides a solution to a customer challenge, enabling performance-based pricing. Victrex spends 5%-6% of sales on research and development per year, with 85% of this customer-driven. Consequently, the relationship with customers is often like a partnership, and this intimacy leads to switching costs. PEEK is typically used in critical applications such as anti-lock braking systems in cars, brackets in airplanes, downhole tools in oil and gas exploration, and spinal fusion cages in healthcare. Given that the consequences of performance failure are severe in these applications, the testing process to become specified for the final product is often long and arduous. For example, two applications using Victrex PEEK in the Boeing 787 took approximately eight years to achieve specification. Once specified, it is rare for customers to switch to another supplier or attempt to find an acceptable substitute product. The respecification process takes time and is disruptive to the supply chain. Victrex asserts that its PEEK chemistry differs slightly from competitors, with higher strength and durability. Consequently, customers contemplating using a different supplier must consider whether the alternate PEEK product will have slightly different performance characteristics. Given that Victrexs PEEK accounts for a small part of the final product cost, the potential reward from switching is low compared with the risk of adverse consequences from altered performance. We think more than half of Victrexs sales are derived from contract specifications, particularly in aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas. These industries also have long product cycles, which increases the stickiness of the relationship.Victrex has moved downstream in the value chain in recent years, producing semifinished products and components, which makes substitution increasingly difficult for customers. Around 30% of sales are now in these downstream or specialty products, including the Invibio business. The company has a full pipeline of downstream products under development with good potential to achieve commercialisation. Consequently, we expect the percentage of sales from downstream products to increase. We dont assign Victrex a wide moat rating because we have less confidence that high returns can be maintained over a very long time frame. Competition in the chemicals industry is intense, and todays specialty chemicals typically become tomorrows commodity chemicals. Over the long term, Victrex may become a victim of its own success. As demand for PEEK grows, the increased opportunity may entice more competitors to enter the market.","Victrex has a Medium Uncertainty Rating. Victrex essentially derives all of its revenue from one core product, PEEK, which results in significant product concentration risk. This risk is ameliorated by the products specialised nature and application in a wide range of industries, including the more defensive healthcare sector. However, most revenue is tied to cyclical end markets, such as automotive and oil and gas, but this is offset by the company's policy of carrying no debt. Victrex is based in the United Kingdom but the majority of sales are outside of the country, leading to high sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currencies, notably the euro and U.S. dollar. After years of focusing on organic growth, the company is now pursuing acquisitions in its quest to move downstream in the value chain. This leads to increased potential for integration risk. Raw materials are primarily hydrocarbon derivatives, which exposes Victrex to volatility in oil and gas prices. However, Victrex is largely able to pass through raw material prices to its customers. Capital intensity is high, but the premium price for PEEK has allowed Victrex to earn strong returns despite generally operating its plants at low utilisation levels.Like most chemical firms, Victrex has environmental, social, and governance risks that are mainly related to production, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions of wastewater and air pollutants. Regulatory changes could increase operating costs, require capital investments to meet new standards, or increase liability risks. Previously undiscovered soil and groundwater contamination on operating sites could lead to material fines or other penalties in the future. Victrex sells into highly demanding end-use applications, including medical products such as implantable spine fusion cages. Product failure could lead to consumer harm and/or product liability claims.","Victrex has a Standard capital allocation rating based on our assessment of the balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions.The balance sheet is sound. While revenue cyclicality is high due to primarily industrial end markets, Victrex typically does not carry debt. We rate investments as fair. Victrex is primarily investing in its shift from only providing PEEK raw materials to also manufacturing PEEK parts and components. We think it is important to diversify in some way, given that the company has essentially one major product line. At some point, it is natural to assume that competition will increase in producing PEEK raw materials, which will make differentiation downstream important in safeguarding the business from a sudden, unforeseen shift in the competitive environment on the upstream side. However, we think progress has been somewhat slow, and we are somewhat concerned about underinvestment.We have a mixed view on shareholder distributions. Victrex carries no debt to ensure that customers are confident in it as a going concern, as finding a substitute for the company's PEEK could be a long and drawn-out process, given its use in demanding and highly regulated applications. While there is a clear business reason for this policy, it also results in an inefficient financial structure. In this case, we think some diversification would be valuable. Victrex is highly cash-generative, but rather than diversify into another business area, excess cash is returned to shareholders through special dividends. In this case, we think diversification could be value-accretive as it could allow the balance sheet to be optimized while broadening the shareholder base, since some investors avoid the company due to its product concentration.","Victrex is a British specialty chemicals company whose business is based predominantly on manufacturing and creating solutions using polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, an ultra-high-performance lightweight plastic. Around 40% of sales are generated in Europe, with Asia and the Americas contributing 30% each. The business has two segments. The industrial segment targets transportation, energy, electronics, and manufacturing, while the medical segment provides healthcare solutions for the implantable device markets.","Victrex is in excellent financial health. The balance sheet is managed very conservatively--possibly too conservatively--with no debt and significant working capital. However, this is a strategic decision to ensure customers have strong faith in the security of PEEK supply, because Victrex has historically been the only major producer.

25/11/2023,Hormel Remains Well-Positioned for Margin Recovery and Should Be Able To Keep Growing Dividend,Hormel Foods Corp,HRL,4,12/10/2023,Kristoffer Inton,32.72,USD,24/11/2023,37.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,A,12/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Hormels investor day disappointed us by offering a three-year plan that highlighted a long-term operating income growth target of 5%-7% per year through fiscal 2026, much of which will come through cost-optimization efforts with a yet-to-be-announced price tag. In contrast, we had expected operating income to grow at a midteen rate over that period, largely representing a recovery of margins to prepandemic levels. Thus, we expect to lower our fair value estimate of $37 per share by a low-double-digit percentage, roughly in line with the stocks 10% drop. Prior to today's event and market reaction, we had thought shares were roughly fairly valued, and expect that will remain the case after our valuation revision. In addition to the operating income growth targets, management announced an annual organic growth rate target of 2%-3%, which matched our expectations, and $225 million in operating income benefit by fiscal 2026 from cost improvement programs. At that level of top-line growth, roughly half or more of Hormel's operating income growth could come organically. But the cost cuts could also deliver the operating income growth target by itself, so the companys target seems to imply that business margins are unlikely to recover to historical levels as we had expected, a change that drives our likely fair value estimate cut. Despite our disappointment with the three-year outlook, our views on the company's narrow moat rating and its ability to maintain its decadeslong streak of annual dividend increases remain intact. We believe the company will continue to generate excess economic profit stemming from its strong brands and entrenched retailer relationships. Additionally, we forecast the dividend can increase by about 5% per year, with leftover cash deployable to share repurchases or debt reduction.","Hormel will reinvigorate Planters to regain the market share it hemorrhaged under previous ownership with its staunch focus on brand spending, boosting its ability to compete in the snack category. Not only will Hormel continue growing its dividend, but by filling its coffers with more cash the firm could be in a position to fund a special dividend, share repurchases, or acquisitions in the medium term. We suspect Hormel is poised to rapidly grow its international business given some of its products already carry strong brand affinity.","Food is a competitive space (from other large manufacturers and smaller niche operators), and if Hormel ratchets back spending behind innovation and advertising, market share could erode. Hormel faces commodity price exposure through both costs and selling prices. Hormel may not be able to always pass on costs to the end-customer with higher prices without realizing volume degradation. Hormel can fall behind changing customer tastes, with aging products falling behind fast-moving startups. This could also lead to increased promotional spending, hurting sales and profitability.",06/09/2023,"Hormel Foods has long been on U.S. shelves, with strong meat-centric brands like Jennie-O, Spam, Dinty Moore, and various Hormel-branded goods. These brands tend to hold number one or two share in their categories. To keep pace with evolving trends, Hormel has expanded its focus through acquisitions of non-meat protein brands like Skippy and Planters and branded meat products like Applegate. It has also entered ethnic and emerging food with Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and Happy Little Plants. Concurrently, Hormel has reduced its commoditized farming footprint, increasingly relying on third-party farmers. Taken together, we think these moves stabilize its competitive standing and improve profitability in the competitive packaged food arena. But selling food isnt easy, with inflation, avian flu, and supply chain bottlenecks as some recent headwinds. Hormel has increased prices and cut costs to offset these risks. Though we expect these challenges to ebb and flow over time, resulting in our stable long-term outlooks for sales growth and adjusted operating margins (about 2% and 13%, respectively), near-term volatility can still be drastic. For example, in 2021, organic revenue growth of 14% amid strong demand was offset by a 160-basis-point contraction in operating margin within surging input cost inflation. In 2023, Hormel reorganized toward the customer channel (retail, food service, and international) rather than by product to streamline sales and improve cross-selling. Customers will now deal with one salesperson. However, we think this may lead to reduced transparency of performance at a detailed level and potential internal tension among product teams. Retail is about two thirds of revenue at high-single-digit operating margin. Much smaller but more profitable, food service is about 30% at a midteens margin. We see low-single-digit sales growth for both, with retail leveraging brands and food service capturing untapped markets. Additionally, we think the two together create demand diversification, as seen when the pandemic hurt food service but greatly benefited retail, and a proving ground for testing innovation within food service that can be taken to retail.","We assign Hormel Foods a narrow economic moat rating based on intangible assets stemming from its strong brands and entrenched relationships with retailers and food-service companies. Leading brands include Spam (claiming the top spot with 50%-plus market share in the $2.4 billion shelf stable meat market versus just 9% share for private label), Applegate Farms and Jennie-O (number three and number four brands, respectively, with a combined 5% share in the $8 billion chilled processed poultry market dwarfed by the 11% share for private label), Skippy (number two with 18% market share in the $2.8 billion nut- and seed-based spreads market consistent with the 18% share held by private label), and Planters (which boasts leading branded share at 17% in the $8.1 billion nuts, seeds, and trail mixes market, though this is eclipsed by the 33% share private label has amassed).The moat is evident through its returns on invested capital including goodwill consistently exceeding our estimate of its cost of capital. Even in 2021 and 2022 when avian flu struck and input cost inflation rose before the company could adjust its prices, it still earned double-digit returns. With price increases having now taken effect, we expect economic returns to migrate back to the low-teens range, lower than the 20%-range that the company has historically earned but still well above our estimate of its cost of capital of about 7%.As anecdotal evidence, we performed some channel checks to measure potential pricing power. Spam sells for 15% higher than private label, Planters peanuts sell for 25% higher (likely capturing the premium end of the market given its high price and lower market share than private label), and Skippy peanut butter for 21% higher. Admittedly, this isnt perfect evidence of pricing power, but we think it indicates willingness to pay higher prices among end-customers.Hormels continued transformation to a branded food firm, as it has deprioritized commoditized fresh meat, has enhanced its moat. With no brand differentiation, raw meat producers are often price takers that are more exposed to commodity price fluctuations and general supply/demand dynamics, as consumers tend to make purchase decisions based on price rather than brand. In comparison, food producers with established brands command pricing power with their customers. As evidence, Hormel generates high-teens into low-20% gross margin, compared with high-single-digits gross margin for meat producer Pilgrims Pride, low-double-digits for Tyson Foods, and midteens for private-label food companies like Treehouse Foods. This requires investment to stay at the forefront of changing customer tastes, as Hormels R&D expense as a percentage of sales of about 30 basis points compared with 20 basis points for Tyson and less than 1 basis point for Pilgrims Pride.Additionally, Hormels typical advertising expenses, usually less than 2% of sales, is well below the industry average of more than 4%. But this hasnt led to a deterioration in its brand intangible assets as market shares for core brands like Hormel, Spam, and Jennie-O have seen market shares rise at this level of spending. Hormels core brands carry enough lasting power that they dont need as much advertising spending to remain strong within their categories.Hormels relationships with both retailers and food-service operators are another key to its intangible assets. Buoyed by leading brands in several categories and an established distribution network, Hormel guarantees its placement in-store despite shelf space limitations and online at the top of searches and pages. This is particularly important because it helps Hormel launch new product innovations (which in turn drives excitement and strengthens retailer relationships) and expand distribution of acquired brands across its national footprintbreadth that a new entrant doesnt have or would have to pay to access. The importance of distribution cant be understatedits costly, time consuming, and difficult to recreate these relationships in the fragmented retail channel. Arguably, the frequent acquisition of smaller, emerging brands is evidence of how hard it is to replicate that scale.Similarly, Hormel can leverage its relationships with food-service operators to launch products that fit their changing needs. For example, 2022 food-service sales grew 20% as Hormel was able to offer foods that required less preparation given customers labor shortages. Existing relationships put the company in a position to continue to gather insights quickly and sell corresponding products widely. Moreover, these operators are willing to pay for these innovations, as evidenced by the higher margins Hormel earns in this segment.We think Hormels capital allocation strategy has largely supported its moat, both through inorganic and organic growth. For example, acquisitions of Skippy peanut butter, Justins nut butters, and Planters expanded it into branded non-meat protein, adding about $11 billion in opportunity in nut spreads and snacking nuts compared with just $2.4 billion for shelf-stable meat. The companys positioning in the deli space was enhanced by the acquisition of Columbus, a premium deli company that complemented its offerings and expanded into a market where branding is possible. Organically, Hormel has captured the on-the-go trend with several product innovations, including Skippy (P.B. Bites, P.B. & Jelly Minis), which helped the brand increase points of distribution by 30% from 2013 to 2018. We view this as an impressive feat given that Skippy had previously been owned by wide-moat Unilever and likely benefited from its own retail relationships. Although Hormels dedicated salesforce provides some benefits, we dont think it is a source of competitive edge. Competitors Tyson and Smithfield Foods forgo their own salesforce in favor of brokers. Hormel argues that its dedicated salesforce allows it to witness firsthand the challenges their clients face, allowing for unique insights to create innovative products to meet these needs. Additionally, the company believes it fosters stronger relationships with clients and distributors. Although there may be some argument that it has helped with Hormels success in the food-service industry, we dont think this is an inimitable competitive advantage. Even though Tyson and Smithfield  currentlyappear to have no plans to launch their own salesforce, we think capital is probably the largest roadblock if they were to switch strategies.We refrain from assigning Hormel a wide moat due to the uncertainty around both its competitiveness and the food landscape beyond 10 years. Competing in a highly competitive food industry, we cite a few reasons that support our assessment. First, Hormels strongest brands still tend to be tied to its historical meat focus. Although its expansion into other categories is reducing its exposure to categories where pricing power remains elusive, there hasnt been enough progress to establish multicategory leadership that we see in other wide-moat food names like Kellogg. Second, its strongest brands dont carry far-away dominance like wide-moat Hershey does in chocolate, for example. Third, unlike wide-moat Mondelez, Hormels strength is exclusively tied to its home U.S. market. Demonstrable brand power across many markets would give us more comfort of the staying power of its competitive advantages. Lastly, we dont see any additional moat sources to strengthen Hormels overall moat, as we dont see benefits from scale in either purchasing or production processes.","Weve assigned Hormel a Medium Uncertainty Rating.The biggest risk as a food producer is commodity price exposure. Although the firm isnt as meat-centric as it once was, it still derives more than 50% of sales from perishable offerings, including fresh meat, particularly pork and turkey. Meat tends to be a commodity, and Hormel, like all producers, is a price taker subject to market supply and demand. Sales of these products are subject to price volatility outside of Hormels control.Across its mix, Hormel faces input cost swings and availability subject to supply and demand. Further, with much of Hormels products based on animal meat, the firm faces risk from disease (African swine fever and avian flu) that could threaten its operations, add price volatility for its products, or weigh on profit margins. Its decision to pivot away from hog production lowered its exposure to feed stock volatility but adds potential volatility from raw meat markets. In addition, Hormel offsets some of its exposure with long-term supply agreements for pork, contracts with turkey growers, and hedging other inputs.Hormel also faces environmental, social, and governance risks related to the healthfulness, quality, and safety of its products, carbon emissions particularly from energy-intensive meat production, water usage for livestock and food production, business ethics issues from potential anti-competitive practices like price fixing, and labor relations. Among these, we think changes in consumer preferences related to healthiness are a particular threat. For one, developed-market consumers are eating less pork, which has been linked to certain cancers, in favor of poultry. Our model takes these trends into account, assuming only modest long-term growth for pork. We view Hormel's other ESG risks as less material and manageable. Additionally, many potential cost increases stemming from these risks would affect all producers equally and would likely be passed onto end consumers.","We rate managements capital allocation actions as Exemplary, owing to Hormels sound balance sheet, exceptional investment track record, and appropriate shareholder distributions. The firm has posted consistently strong economic returns, with a five-year average return on invested capital including goodwill of 13% versus our 7% weighted average cost of capital assumption. Additionally, returns have remained above our estimate of its cost of capital even in years when the company faced material volatility in its businesses.We assess Hormels balance sheet as sound, stemming from both low unleveraged business risk and low balance sheet risk with our forecast for average net debt to adjusted EBITDA of about 1 time over the next three years. As a food producer, the company faces low revenue cyclicality and has low operating leverage, leading to our assessment of low business risk. Moreover, Hormel also maintains a solid balance sheet that faces little risk. Historically, the company has even maintained more cash than debt, except for years when it has funded larger acquisitions. Even when debt rose following the 2021 acquisition of Planters, Hormels maturities remain long dated (less than 30% due over the next three years) and overall leverage remains low.We think the companys investments have been exceptional. Hormel has made logical acquisitions and investments that fit its branded foods strategy. Furthermore, it has paid fair prices and integrated the acquired businesses well, growing sales at accretive margins from acquisitions like Skippy, Applegate, and Wholly Guacamole. For example, in 2021, Hormel purchased Planters for $3.4 billion, although a $560 million tax benefit effectively reduced the purchase price to $2.8 billion and the EBITDA multiple to 12.5 times; this is a reasonable price, in our view, given the brand's high-teens operating margins. Under previous ownership, Planters had seen market share declines stemming from underinvestment. We think that through innovation and subsequent marketing support, Hormel will be able to rejuvenate the Planters brand sufficiently to maintain its market leadership position and superior profit margins.Lastly, we think Hormels shareholder distributions have been appropriate. As a dividend aristocrat, the company holds an impressive record of increasing dividends consecutively for 57 years. It remains committed to maintaining this trend, which we think is an appropriate goal given the companys cash flow generation. We forecast the dividend growing about 9% per year through our forecast period, about the same pace as the preceding five years. Shares are repurchased more opportunistically, with the dividend the primary focus of shareholder distributions. ","Historically meat-focused, Hormel Foods broadened its lineup to include other protein offerings and become a branded food company. The firm sells its wares through multiple channels, including U.S. retail (63% of fiscal 2022 sales), U.S. food service (31%), and international (6%). By product, 53% of sales were from perishable food, 27% from shelf-stable, 17% from poultry, and 3% from other products. Major brands include Hormel, Spam, Jennie-O, Columbus, Applegate, Planters, and Skippy. Many of these hold the number one or two market share in their respective categories.","At the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2023, Hormel had about $3.3 billion in debt, compared with $687 million in cash. Both total leverage and maturities look manageable and pose no concerns for us. Hormels leverage ticked higher after the 2021 acquisition of Planters for $3.35 billion before tax benefits, with total debt to adjusted EBITDA up to 2.4 times from 1 time in fiscal 2020. By the end of fiscal 2022, leverage had fallen to 2.1 times, and we forecast enough free cash flow generation (averaging in the high single digits as a percentage of sales between fiscal 2023-27) for the company to reach its target of 1.5 to 2.0 times by fiscal 2024 if it chooses to repay debt.Hormel prioritizes maintaining its status as a dividend aristocrat, which it has held for its 57 years of consecutive annual increases. Managements conservative approach to the balance sheet and our forecast for continued free cash flow generation put it in good position to continue that streak without having to sacrifice capital spending or attractive acquisitions. We forecast dividends to increase at a 5% rate annually through fiscal 2027, maintaining a payout ratio of roughly 60%. While we anticipate the firm will remain a consolidator in the space, we dont model unannounced acquisitions, given the uncertainty around size, timing, and valuation.

24/11/2023,Weaker 2024 Guidance Leads Us to Moderate Our Near-Term Expectations for Deere,Deere & Co,DE,3,22/11/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,370.76,USD,23/11/2023,360.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,B,22/11/2023,"The key takeaway from earnings was managements weaker 2024 guidance. The company called out moderating commodity prices and higher interest rates as key drivers to weakening ag fundamentals. That said, management continues to point to the replacement cycle as a near-term driver. However, this isnt enough to drive sales and margin growth in 2024. As a result, weve lowered our 2024 sales and margin estimates. We now expect equipment sales to decline by 12%, while operating margins decrease over 300 basis points to 19.7%. These changes led to a 5% decrease in our fair value estimate, which now sits at $360 per share (from $379 previously). Deere shared similar sentiment to its peers regarding the South American ag market. The region has continued to weaken, as declining crop prices and high interest rates have slowed demand for ag equipment in the region. That said, ag fundamentals in North America remain constructive, largely due to resilient demand for cash crops. Key data points like the stocks-to-use ratio are still below previous cycle peaks. Corn stockpiles are higher than the past few years but have yet to reach peaks. Soybean supplies remain relatively low to previous cycles, which we think may lead to stable soybean prices in the near term. We view Deeres shares as slightly overvalued. The companys stock has experienced downward pressure over the past handful of months as investors have grappled with the question of moderating ag demand. Deeres fourth-quarter earnings print confirmed those concerns. However, we think its important to note that Deere can still benefit from the replacement cycle. Management highlighted during the earnings call that inventories in some product categories remain below previous cycle peaks and that fleet ages are still relatively high. We believe this shows theres some protection from a protracted downturn. Nonetheless, wed like to see a greater margin of safety in shares before getting excited about valuation. ","Higher crop prices encourage farmers to grow more crops and will lead to more farming equipment purchases, substantially boosting Deere's revenue growth. Deere will benefit from strong replacement demand, as uncertainty around trade, weather, and agriculture commodity demand has eased, encouraging farmers to refresh their machine fleet. Increased infrastructure spending in the U.S. and emerging markets will lead to more construction equipment purchases, benefiting Deere.","China could pull back on agriculture imports, weakening global demand for crops. The fallout would lead to lower crop prices, largely due to higher supply, pushing farmers to delay equipment purchases. Trade tensions between developed economies could escalate to punitive tariffs on agricultural commodity imports, reducing the demand for farmers crops in certain countries. Deere faces stiff competition from global competitors across end markets. Growing competition could pressure Deere's market share.",22/11/2023,"Deere offers customers an extensive portfolio of agriculture and construction products. We think it will continue to be the leader in the agriculture industry and one of the top players in construction. For over a century, the company has been the pre-eminent manufacturer of mission-critical agricultural equipment, which has led to its place as one of the worlds most valuable brands. Deeres strong brand is underpinned by its high-quality, extremely durable, and efficient products. Customers in developed markets also value Deeres ability to reduce the total cost of ownership.  The companys strategy focuses on delivering a comprehensive solution for farmers. Deeres innovative products target each phase of the production process, which includes field preparation, planting and seeding, applying chemicals, and harvesting. The company also embeds technology in its products, from guidance systems to seed placement and customized spraying applications. Over the past decade, the company has continually released new products and upgraded existing product models to drive greater machine efficiency. Customers also rely on the services that Deere and its dealers provide, for example, machine maintenance and access to its proprietary aftermarket parts. Furthermore, its digital applications help customers interact with dealers, manage their fleet, and track machine performance to determine when maintenance is needed.  Deere has exposure to end markets with attractive tailwinds. In agriculture, we think demand for corn and soybeans will be strong in the near term, largely due to robust demand from China and tight global supplies. On the construction side, we believe the company will benefit from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal in the U.S. The countrys roads are in poor condition, which has led to pent-up road construction demand. Looking further out, we believe precision ag will be an incremental value driver for Deere. The company recently closed the precision ag loop (in terms of capabilities) with the introduction of its autonomous 8R tractor. We estimate precision ag presents an over-$7 billion sales opportunity for the ag leader this decade.","We assign Deere a wide economic moat rating, underpinned by intangible assets and switching costs. Deere has built one of the worlds most recognizable brands, which has led to strong brand loyalty among farmers. The company has consistently provided customers with reliable, high-quality products, while working to reduce the total cost of ownership. These factors have led to Deere becoming one of the worlds most valuable brands. The strength of its brand and extensive dealer network has solidified Deere as the market leader for agricultural equipment. Deere delivers world-class products, in addition to value-added services to customers through its global dealer network. We believe smaller local and regional competitors will struggle to win market share in agriculture and construction end markets globally, allowing Deere to maintain its strong market share positions.Deeres intense brand loyalty among farmers and strong competitive positioning leads to pricing power. For decades, the company has consistently produced best-in-class agricultural equipment, leading to the largest installed base in the industry. Deere has been at the forefront of innovation in farming, mechanizing crop production, allowing farmers to do more with less. Today, the companys equipment can help farmers save on operation costs (use less fuel, chemicals, and labor), while also increasing crop yields (without having to materially increase farm acreage). Farmers value premium products (high specifications and features) that can withstand high utilization and operate outside of daylight hours. We believe Deere benefits from pricing power, manifested from its brand familiarity of more than a century and ability to continually provide innovative products. Notably, the companys large agricultural equipment command premium pricing due to the value added from its product features and technological capabilities (boosts farmer productivity). Customers come to Deere not only for the best products in the industry, but also for its ability to provide aftermarket parts on-demand and services to keep their machines running, reducing machine down-time.Additionally, the company has been committed to improving machine efficiency. Deeres precision agriculture solutions aid farmers in field preparation, planting, chemical spraying, and harvesting. Tillage equipment used in field preparation can utilize guidance systems to reduce overlap in each machine pass, collect data on field conditions (satellite mapping), and be flexible enough to adjust depth and down pressure maneuvers. In planting, Deeres machines can precisely place and space seeds in the field, all while moving up to 10 miles per hour faster than previous models (without losing accuracy). Farmers can also apply chemicals (herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides) to weeds through customized spray solutions (machines can control individual nozzles to dispense a spray). When plants are ready to be picked, Deeres products can harvest more capacity, without reducing crop quality or losing crops, in addition to saving on fuel costs. We believe Deeres superior product performance supports the firms brand equity and pricing power.Deeres products help farmers save on farming input costs, limit machine maintenance and repair costs, ultimately leading to a lower total cost of ownership. We believe this dynamic exists for a few reasons. First, the companys focus on improving machine efficiency through product innovation has boosted productivity for farmers through the reduction in input costs (less chemicals, fuel, and labor needed to produce crops compared with years past). Deeres precision solutions allow farmers to become more informed on whats driving higher crop yield, from optimal seed placement to targeted chemical spraying. Second, the companys higher-margin aftermarket business provides farmers priority on proprietary parts and services through its extensive dealer network, limiting service intervals and machine down-time. Additionally, machine connectivity helps both customers and dealers track data (machine utilization rates and productivity) to inform future service needs, allowing farmers to plan maintenance versus having to service machinery when they fail (can be disruptive in farming given finite windows to carry out farming operations).The total cost of ownership is a focus for customers in developed markets, who look for machines that help minimize on future costs (labor, maintenance and repair, spare parts, fuel, and insurance costs) and are not necessarily looking for the cheapest up-front equipment (primarily a focus for customers in developing markets). Cheaper equipment can increase the likelihood of machine failure during operation, leading to lost productivity that cuts into an operators profitability (mission-critical equipment). Fuel consumption costs are another lever that operators can focus on to drive down total ownership costs. Deere offers a wide range of products that enhance fuel efficiency, specifically through its electric drivetrain offerings. These products also help the company address carbon emissions concerns; which is increasingly becoming a point of focus for regulators. We think Deeres risk to increased emissions regulation is moderate given its continued focus on producing next-generation products that reduce machine emissions.We believe Deere is a leader in the agriculture industry when it comes to helping customers reduce the total cost of ownership. Its products employ better efficiency and output for farmers compared with competitors, allowing them to spread costs over the lifetime of equipment (operating leverage as crop yields increase). We believe this dynamic supports its brand value in the eyes of customers looking to optimize their operations.We also think Deeres construction business is strong, thanks to its Wirtgen acquisition in 2017. Prior to the acquisition, the companys product portfolio was focused on earthmoving equipment, such as, bulldozers, graders, wheel loaders, and excavators. That quickly changed as Wirtgen expanded the product portfolio to include both road construction (milling, paving, and compacting) and mineral equipment (surface miners, crushers, and asphalt plants). Today, the move has taken Deeres construction business from being a top 10 global player to a top three player behind Caterpillar and Komatsu. Customers value Wirtgens premium brands given its ability to consistently deliver strong product performance. We believe this has led to the construction business developing pricing power. The segments profitability has improved since the acquisition, showing the near term looks bright. Additionally, we think Wirtgens strong position in the road construction business globally gives Deere access to new customers in emerging markets.Deeres extensive dealer network distributes products and provides access to proprietary aftermarket parts and services across multiple geographies. The breadth of Deeres dealer network is unmatched, with over 2,000 dealer locations in North America and approximately 3,700 globally (has a significant presence on every continent). These dealers are often very large organizations that exclusively sell Deere products. We think its very difficult for existing competitors and new entrants to replicate the size and coverage of Deeres dealers. Fully stocking a branch is challenging without similar product breadth to Deere, hence, why many competitors products are sold at dealerships that carry multiple product lines. Deeres value proposition not only consists of its high-quality products, but it also includes the reliable product support provided by dealers. When customers need parts or machine servicing, they can rely on the dealer network to reduce their machine down-time.Deeres mission-critical equipment and increased focus on its installed base through aftermarket and service offerings keep customers from switching. The companys machines perform mission-critical functions for farmers, who work during a finite window during the year. For customers, switching to an alternative product poses significant risk to their operations, with the potential for disruptions from machine failures and long lead times to service equipment. The high cost of failure associated with switching away from Deeres products increases the likelihood of missing valuable time to plant and harvest crops, ultimately cutting into a farmers profitability. Deeres service agreements give customers priority on proprietary aftermarket parts and services from dealers, making it easy to understand what the total cost of a machine will be throughout its operating life.Furthermore, customers invest a significant amount of time and money into machinery, creating additional friction to switch products. The purchase price of heavy machinery can run up into the hundreds of thousands (and can get into the low-million-dollar range for combines), in addition to the time it takes machine operators to fully train on a machine to reach optimal productivity. The companys parts distribution and extensive dealer network provide customers with aftermarket parts and reliable services to ensure their equipment operate efficiently, saving them from the headache of machine down-time and from having to search for parts independently (parts are not easy to replace). Customers also find value in Deeres strong secondary market, where sellers of used equipment benefit from high resale values, helping reduce the total cost of ownership.We do not think Deeres wide economic moat faces any substantial threats from environmental, social, and governance risks. Deere has exposure to product safety issues, carbon emissions and environmental regulation, but we do not view them as material enough to include in our valuation. Product safety issues include both customer injuries while operating Deere machinery and injuries suffered by Deere employees in the production of products. Carbon emissions regulation is increasingly a topic of discussion, but we think Deere is already hedging against this risk through the development of next-generation products that reduce the carbon emissions of its products, namely its electric drivetrains.Additionally, we think the effect from climate change and regulation by government authorities will likely be incremental rather than immediate. Both the agriculture industry and academic institutions are studying how the effect of changing weather patterns will impact farmer growing operations. For example, academic institutions are focusing on the effects of growing crops in warmer climates. Technology is being used as a critical input to understand what factors drive successful crop generation under this scenario. Deere is also exposed to environmental regulation, largely stemming from the environmental impact that agricultural machines have on soil and water quality. We believe Deere faces little risk on this front, as the company continues to invest in next-generation products that will aim to reduce emissions.Another important topic in the agriculture space is the focus on gasoline blending mandates for internal combustion engine vehicles by government authorities around the world (corn is a major input to the ethanol used in gasoline blending). We think biofuel targets will lead to modest ethanol gasoline adoption, acting as a support to corn demand. However, this positive factor could be offset over the next two decades, as governments start to push for electric vehicle adoption, moving away from ICE vehicles.","We assign Deere a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. We continue to think that the most substantial risk to Deere is a declining commodity environment, given the firm's exposure to crops, such as corn, soybeans, and grains to name a few. The middle part of the last decade was an example of what can happen to corn and soybean prices when global supplies are high. A few years earlier, the reverse was true when prices spiked due to the U.S. drought. The lack of rainfall decreased crop yields and ultimately global supply. Over the past couple of years, prices have increased significantly, reaching relatively close to the level seen last decade. The rise in corn and soybean prices is attributed to strong demand from China and constrained global supply.In construction, we think the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal in the U.S. will be the main growth driver. Globally, we expect infrastructure spending in emerging markets to be relatively strong, as there is ample demand to build new roads and infrastructure to increase urbanization. However, an economic slowdown can quickly reverse investment in construction spending.We think the impact from climate change will be incremental, as the industry and academic institutions are studying ways to grow crops in warmer climates. Additionally, the potential for increased electric vehicle adoption could reduce demand for ethanol (corn is an input) used in internal combustion engine vehicles.Deere faces competition from global rivals, mainly CNH and to a lesser extent Agco. CNH is a viable threat, as its products have garnered strong brand loyalty among farmers. We think its unlikely that these firms can materially improve product quality to rival Deere, but we believe Deere will need to continually improve the efficiency of its products.","We assign Deere an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is exceptional and supports its competitive positioning. We also think Deeres shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think Deere has a sound balance sheet. The companys low balance sheet risk is largely due to its manageable debt levels and access to credit lines. We expect its net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio and the number of debt maturities coming due in the near term to be relatively low. The captive finance arm does carry more debt, but we think this is reasonable given the nature of its operations. The business provides financing for both customers and dealers to support the sale of Deere products.Deeres investment strategy is exceptional, in our view. The companys acquisition strategy has been focused on expanding its product portfolio and digital capabilities. On the product side, Deere acquired Wirtgen, a road construction business in Germany. Deere bought the company for $5.2 billion in 2017 at a transaction multiple of 9.5 times enterprise value/2017 EBITDA, which we think was a fair price, with annual synergies of approximately EUR 100 million by 2022. We like the fact that Wirtgen expanded Deeres product portfolio from earth-moving equipment to include road construction and mineral equipment. The companys premium brands helped Deere move from a top-10 construction player globally to a top-three player. Also in 2017, Deere made a smaller purchase (about $300 million), acquiring Blue River Technology, an ag tech startup. This move illustrates Deeres commitment to investing in next-generation products that utilize computer vision and machine learning to make machines more efficient. Deere gained See & Spray, a sense and act technology that enables plant-level crop management. In 2021, Deere acquired Bear Flag (for about $300 million), the first to market with autonomous tractors. Deere was drawn to Bear Flags retrofit-first focus, meaning its autonomous technology is designed to be installed on existing equipment. The move sped up Deeres development efforts, culminating in the launch of its autonomous 8R tractor at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. Looking ahead, we expect Deere to strategically make acquisitions to boost its competitive positioning. We believe Deere will likely favor organic growth, propelled by investments in internal projects to improve product efficiency and performance. Deere has projected the incremental addressable market is over $150 billion (including small ag and construction markets). By comparison, our estimate of the incremental market opportunity comes in slightly above Deeres expectations, at about $161 billion. We define the market opportunity as the value precision ag creates for farmers, including input cost savings and increased crop yields. This contrasts with the traditional definition of TAM, which measures the total revenue opportunity. In our view, most of the value created will flow to farmers, while ag manufacturers capture the balance through hardware and software sales. In terms of revenue, we estimate Deere pulling in over $7 billion. For Deere, the goal is to get to 10% recurring revenue by 2030 from less than 1% today. We think the company can get there by connecting more machines and driving higher engagement in the John Deere Operations Center. We think this new operating model has the potential to drive higher profitability for the company, but wed like to see Deere gain some additional traction with customer adoption before baking in material sales growth into our forecast. Deere's precision ag prospects pushed management to raise its midcycle operating margin target to 20% by 2030 from 15% previously. We'd like to see the company achieve a few more milestones before materially raising our midcycle margin target. In our cash flow model, we assume operating margins will land at 17.4% by our midcycle year. Our forecast gives Deere additional credit for its precision ag efforts, but we're still taking a measured approach to midcycle margins.We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. Deere is committed to dividend payouts, increasing the dividend year over year and holding it steady during agricultural downturns. We expect a continued commitment to dividend payouts well into the future. Historically, share repurchases have fluctuated based on agricultural demand globally. We think management will be committed to consistently repurchasing shares, returning nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders throughout the economic cycle. In a midcycle environment, we expect free cash flow to be $8 billion.","Deere is the worlds leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, producing some of the most recognizable machines in the heavy machinery industry. The company is divided into four reportable segments: production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and John Deere Capital. Its products are available through an extensive dealer network, which includes over 2,000 dealer locations in North America and approximately 3,700 locations globally. John Deere Capital provides retail financing for machinery to its customers, in addition to wholesale financing for dealers, which increases the likelihood of Deere product sales.","Deere maintains a sound balance sheet. On the industrial side, the net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio was relatively low at the end of fiscal 2023, coming in below 1. Total outstanding debt, including both short- and long-term debt, was $8.4 billion. Deeres strong balance sheet gives management the financial flexibility to run a balanced capital allocation strategy going forward that mostly favors organic growth and also returns cash to shareholders. In terms of liquidity, we believe the company can meet its near-term debt obligations given its strong cash balance. The companys cash position as of fiscal year-end 2023 stood at $5.7 billion on its industrial balance sheet. We also find comfort in Deeres ability to tap into available lines of credit to meet any short-term needs. Deere has access to $3.3 billion in credit facilities.We think Deere can generate solid free cash flow throughout the economic cycle. We believe the company can generate $8 billion in free cash flow in our midcycle year, supporting its ability to return nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we think management is determined to rationalize its footprint by reducing the number of facilities in mature markets. If successful, this will put Deere on much better footing from a cost perspective, further supporting its ability to return cash to shareholders. The captive finance arm holds considerably more debt than the industrial business, but this is reasonable, given its status as a lender to both customers and dealers. Total debt stood at $48 billion in fiscal 2023, along with $51 billion in finance receivables and $1.7 billion in cash. In our view, Deere enjoys a strong financial position supported by a clean balance sheet and strong free cash flow prospects.",DE,Industrials,106217644032.0,NYQ,1758426.0,USD,370.760009765625,True,0,391.3031583898271,378.4848029996173,1
24/11/2023,"Post-Acquisition of Fox Pest Control, Rollins Seems Well-Poised",Rollins Inc,ROL,2,26/10/2023,Grant Slade,40.02,USD,23/11/2023,32.5,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,26/10/2023,"Rollins strong third-quarter performance provided investors with a level of comfort that North American pest-control market conditions havent deteriorated sharply in recent months. The company delivered elevated organic growth of 8.4% year on yearlargely according with our full-year 2023 organic growth expectationsoutperforming the weak third-quarter North American result for wide-moat peer Rentokil Initial. Price increases more than offset inflationary pressures and worked in combination with operating leverage to continue widening Rollins operating margin, which rose 240 basis points to 22.3% in the third quarter and thus was tracking modestly ahead of our prior expectation for 2023 EBIT margin progression. We have lifted our 2023 EBIT forecast to $617 million and our EPS estimate to $0.93, representing respective increases of 3.5% and 4.5%. In turn, the combination of the modest upgrade to our near-term operating margin assumption and a time value of money adjustment leads us to lift our fair value estimate by 5% to $32.50 per share. Rollins robust organic growth relieved investors; the stock was up 8% at the time of writing after having fallen sharply in response to the recent trading update from Rentokil. Still, with Rollins' stock down some 22% since late July, we think investors expectations for the wide-moat company look far more reasonable than they have for quite some time. Indeed, we think Rentokils recent soft trading updatefor greater detail, see our Oct. 19 note Rentokil Initial: Shares Appealing as Weak Pest Control Sales Offer an Attractive Entry Pointhas acted as a reminder to investors that organic growth delivered by Rollins since the coronavirus pandemic is elevated and has outpaced historical norms by a substantial margin.","The recent uptick in capital allocated to tuck-in acquisitions is likely to continue, supporting economies of scale and boosting operating margin.  Phase 2 of the route optimization technology rollout looks to further widen Rollins EBIT margin.  Increasing per-capita spending on pest control should support Rollins organic growth at a mid-single-digit clip. ","Competition is heating up for pest control M&A, putting upward pressure on deal multiples.  A somewhat more passive approach to M&A may see Rollins outbid on value-accretive acquisitions.  The ultimate rollout of phase 3 and 4 of Rollins route optimization technology may be less margin-accretive than earlier iterations. ",27/04/2023,"Rollins strategy is to reinforce the density benefits afforded to its market-leading operations in the highly localized pest-control services markets it competes in across North America. Ever-improving unit costs are offered by economies of density in each regional market in which Rollins operates. Rollins seeks to continue to amass these benefits via organic growth and a continued focus on tuck-in acquisitions aimed at rolling up the fragmented North American pest-control services market.  A persistent focus on improving technician productivity and reducing operating costs reinforces the superior cost curve position of the Rollins franchise. Recent investments in route optimization technology exemplify Rollins cost-out strategy, the continued rollout of which is likely to widen EBIT margins. A durable cost advantage has accrued to Rollins as result of execution of the business strategy, leading to our wide-moat designation. Pest-control acquisitions and continuing focus on cost-out initiatives are key to the strategy. Nonetheless, Rollins remains equally focused on the defense of its leading North American market positions, noting that the loss of customers quickly unwinds the operating-margin-widening benefits of density. This defense comes in the form of a relentless focus on customer service excellence, which Rollins views as key to its high customer retention rates. With the business significant skew toward the residential pest-control segment of the market. where industry barriers to entry are lowest, this forms an important component of Rollins strategy. Rollins requires annual training of all of pest-control technicians and limits its organic market share gains to maintain strong service levels and customer satisfaction. Rollins asserts that persistent organic top-line growth above midsingle digits may negatively affect customer retention rates as the group could struggle to balance growth with service quality. ","We credit Rollins with a wide economic moat rating, reflecting the superior cost position of the North American industry-leading pest-control franchise. Rollins purchased the Orkin pest-control business in the mid-1960s. By the early 1990s, Rollins had fully divested its range of non-pest-control business interests to focus on the pest-control industry. Today, Rollins is North Americas largest pest-control business with operations spanning 47 U.S. states and Canada. Organic growth and spirited merger and acquisition activitywhich commenced in the 1990s and remains a key component of Rollins strategy todayhave delivered market-leading positions across the highly localized pest-control markets in which Rollins competes. Leading share in localized pest-control markets translates into cost advantages, which accrue to a route-based business like pest control as density of service provision increases.The professional pest-control industry provides services to suppress pest prevalence and maintain the hygiene of the physical locations of commercial, public-sector, and residential customers. Interventions carried out by the industry contain pests that could otherwise damage commercial interests or endanger public health, including rodents, cockroaches, bedbugs, ants, wasps, termites, birds, snakes, and fleas. Provision of services to the residential segment of the North American pest-control market, inclusive of termite prevention, accounts for approximately 65% of revenue with the remainder attributed to commercial customers. This contrasts with a number of Rollins major European pest-control peers, which tend to focus heavily on the commercial segment of global pest-control markets. The divergence in sales mix relative to peers is partly explained by the geographic focus of Rollins on the U.S., which features a significantly larger residential market for pest-control services owing to climate and its termite-prone timber-frame housing stock. Rollins does not compete in niche segments of the pest-control market, which include agricultural, marine and large-scale vector control.Economies of scale prevail typically in business operations, which are characterized by high fixed costs. Fixed costs emanate from an inability to scale certain production costs below some minimum level when demand is low. As a result, certain categories of production costs arent fully variable, meaning a business must bear its fixed costs in full regardless of whether demand is high or low. Pest control is a prime example of an inability to scale production costs to precisely align with prevailing market demand. Analyzing Rollins cost structure is challenging, owing to the fact Rollins does not disclose the individual line items that make up cost of services provided or selling, general, and administrative costs. Nonetheless, inspection of the cost structure of its major pest-control peersincluding Rentokil Initial and Anticimexis instructive. Fixed and step-fixed (part fixed and part variable) costs dominate the cash operating costs of pest-control businesses. In the case of Rentokil Initial, an approximate 75% of cash operating costs are considered fixed or step-fixed in nature. Fixed and step-fixed costs account for an approximate 66% of Anticimexs cash operating costs. Most significant among these largely invisible production cost categories is labor, which constituted an average of 60% of total cash operating costs over 2016-20 for Rentokil Initial and Anticimex. Further sources of cost indivisibility stem from pest-control service vehicle fleet costs, property expenses, and other fixed costs. Therefore, players that boast superior localized scale, such as Rollins, benefit from a durable cost advantage as fixed and step-fixed costs are better fractionalized across a larger revenue base relative to players with inferior local market share.The economics of route-based businesses such as pest control are overwhelmingly localized. Increased local market share (scale) translates into better unit costs and therefore a widened operating margin. As market share increases, the use of routing optimization tools, density planning, and smart scheduling for Rollins pest-control technicians unlocks the density benefits from the ongoing consolidation of localized pest control. Rollins global industry-leading cost position is evidenced in its operating margins. Superior density in the North American markets where Rollins competes has yielded higher average EBIT margins over the preceding five years relative to other large-scale internationally active players. These key internationally active competitors, which include Rentokil Initial, Terminix, Anticimex, and Ecolab, are also actively engaged in the ongoing roll-up of the global industry. With Rollins enjoying better margins than its largest competitorswhich also benefit from EBIT margin-widening scale economieswe infer that the cost advantage that Rollins maintains over the highly fragmented tail end of the market is meaningful. ","We assign Rollins a Medium Uncertainty Rating. Demand for pest control benefits from the essential role the services play in protecting the public from health and safety risks. As a result, the groups pest-control revenue is largely insensitive to the vagaries of the business cycle. The highly contracted nature of revenueapproximately 80% of Rollins revenue is contractedprovides a further level of earnings protection. However, the extent of operating leverage in the cost structure does leave the group exposed to customer losses, which mitigates some of the virtues of scale economies enjoyed by Rollins.We deem environmental, social, and governance risks associated with Rollins as low. The pest-control business implements a range of chemical-based pest interventions. Some of these chemicalswhich include pesticides and rodenticidescan, if implemented incorrectly, be dangerous should they come into contact with customers, Rollins personnel, or the surrounding environment. Nonetheless, we see the risk associated with the use of pesticides as well managed by robust technician training and operational procedures. Separately, as a route-based service provider, Rollins operates a substantial fleet of service vehicles. It is transitioning to a lower-emission service vehicle fleet with increasing use of hybrid and electric vehicles. ","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Rollins. Were in favor of Rollins' ongoing participation in the roll-up of the global pest-control industry. Tuck-in acquisitions remain a key part of Rollins strategy. Nonetheless, while we appreciate the highly selective approach to its acquisitions, we think Rollins could create greater value for shareholders by hastening the pace at which it is allocating capital toward tuck-in acquisition targets. Major pest-control peers also active in North America, including Rentokil Initial and Terminix, have outspent Rollins in recent years. Consideration of a wider range of potential acquisition targets, including establishing a meaningful presence in fast-growing Asian pest-control markets, could assist Rollins in deploying more capital toward shareholder value-accretive M&A targets.Rollins prudent approach to its balance sheet is sound and presents very little risk to shareholder value. In fact, we think the companys highly conservative approach to debt could be somewhat relaxed without risking the balance sheet, particularly given that revenue is largely immune to the ebbs and flow of the business cycle, owing to the ""necessitylike"" demand characteristics of pest control.We deem Rollins shareholder distribution policies as appropriate. The business is highly cash-generative, owing largely to the capital-light nature of the pest-control industry. While acquisitions are Rollins largest use of cash, free cash flow is also returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. A special dividendtypically declared at the end of the third quarter of the fiscal yearprovides Rollins with the flexibility to return capital to shareholders that is surplus to near-term M&A requirements. Historically, surplus capital has also been returned to shareholders via on-market share buybacks, albeit on a far less frequent basis than via the payment of special dividends. ","Rollins is a global leader in route-based pest-control services, with operations spanning North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Australia. Its portfolio of pest-control brands includes the prominent Orkin brand, market leader in the U.S., where it boasts near national coverage, and in Canada. Residential pest and termite prevention dominates the services provided by Rollins, owing to the groups ongoing focus on U.S. and Canadian markets. ","Rollins typically conservative balance sheet is in good health, with a net cash position of $50 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 despite the modest use of debt to fund the April 2023 Fox Pest Control acquisition. Rollins takes a highly prudent approach to the use of debt, typically using it only to act opportunistically when a quality acquisition target is in play and using subsequent operating cash flow to promptly retire debt. In line with this approach, we expect Rollins to use free cash flow to promptly retire debt used to finance the Fox Pest Control acquisition.We think Rollins has the capacity to incorporate more debt in its target capital structure, particularly given the demand profile for pest-control services, which tends to be very insensitive to the vagaries of the business cycle. As such, Rollins retains substantial balance sheet flexibility to capitalize on larger acquisitions if such opportunities arise. Returning surplus capital to shareholders could also be considered.Rollins maintains $425 million in debt facilities, which provide an additional source of liquidity. The facilities carry a leverage covenant of 3.0 times net debt/EBITDA and mature in April 2024.",ROL,Consumer Cyclical,19801995264.0,NYQ,1409937.0,USD,40.02000045776367,True,0,37.89478373808,43.17575680768272,1
25/11/2023,China Citic Bank Faces Smaller Margin Pressure Than Peers in 2023,China Citic Bank Corp Ltd,601998,3,,Iris Tan,5.45,CNY,24/11/2023,5.2,High,,Poor,,,No Text Available,"Citics bank wealth management products grew 5.4% from 2022, in contrast to the 8.4% decline for the bank industry.  The bank has achieved some positive outcomes from its three-year business reform since new management came onboard in 2019. These included a strengthening wealth management business, enhanced corporate customer mix and credit quality. Citic also adopted strict loan classification by including loans overdue more than 60 days as bad debt.","Citic's property exposure faces growing risks due to the weakening property sales and rising developer defaults. Citic will face higher interest payment for its convertible bonds in 2023 and 2024 as interest rates for the fifth and sixth year of its duration are set to be higher at 3.2% and 4% respectively.  Citic faces greater capital strain than peers: Given its weaker deposit franchise, the bank has to rely heavily on the more expensive wholesale funding.",26/09/2023,"Corporate banking is China Citic Bank's flagship business, which boasts a solid customer base of large-scale state-owned enterprises. This is thanks to its strong connection with its parent China Citic Group, one of the largest SOE conglomerates, with businesses covering financial, real estate, infrastructure, energy, resources, manufacturing, and construction. Serving nearly 700,000 corporate customers, the bank specializes in trade finance, cash management, and custodian services.  Citic has strong relationships with strategic corporate customers. These large and financially strong companies concentrate in the auto, energy, construction and equipment manufacturing. Another group of its strategic customers are institutional customers in public sectors, including municipal construction, transportation, education, science and health. These customers have good credit quality and represent nearly half of the corporate loan book. These two corporate customer groups contributed about half of the bank's total deposits. They are also significant contributors to fee income. Management has taken effective measures to reduce corporate loan risks through structure optimization and better customer selection, but its corporate bad-debt ratio remains higher than peers.  Investment banking and retail banking are two primary focuses for its strategic transition. Leveraging its relationship with Citic Group, it aims to establish an integrated platform to provide various financial services to its corporate customers through cooperation with the group's subsidiaries: Citic Securities, Citic Trust, Citic Prudential Life Insurance, and Hua Xia Fund. We are positive about this move, as these financial subsidiaries are well positioned in their respective markets. Retail banking in wealth management, retail lending, and card business is another focal point. We believe Citic is gaining increasing synergies from its parent group in customer engagement and comprehensive financing businesses, evidenced in its solid growth in assets under management and fee income growth from credit card and wealth management services. But we believe the bank still need time to strengthen its deposit base.","We believe China Citic Bank does not have an economic moat as the bank is operating at a smaller scale than those moaty Chinese banks we cover. Citic's bank deposit shares and bank asset shares both constitute about 2% of the industry in China. Comparing it with the Big Four state-owned enterprise banks, which each boast market share from 8% to 10%, we do not believe Citic enjoys significant scale advantage.The banks weak retail banking business translates to high funding costs. Its retail deposits represent merely 24% of total deposits, much lower than the above-45% levels for high-quality large banks in our coverage. Additionally, it relies more heavily on wholesale (interbank) funding (representing about one third of its total liabilities). Along with other smaller banks, it has to offer higher deposit rates to lure depositors from other banks. Citic's average deposit rate is higher than those of SOE banks and China Merchants Bank. As a result, Citics average funding costs stand at the high end of the industry over the past few years.The banks operating efficiency is slightly weaker than the average level of the eight listed Chinese banks under our coverage. As the bank has been actively shifting its focus into retail banking and asset management through optimization and expansion of its branch network and investment in internet finance, we expect its operating efficiency will face rising pressure in the long run.Over the past few years, Citic has recorded below-average returns, as a result of low fee-income contribution and high funding costs. We expect an average return on equity over our forecast period of 8%, below our 12% cost of equity assumption. This is in light of rising pressure on funding costs, persistent provision pressure as the bank gains increased exposure to the property market, and increased operating expenses as the company shifts its strategic focus to retail banking, investment banks, and internet finance, in order to offset slowing credit demands from the troubling corporate sector. We do not expect Citic to strengthen its deposit base and reduce funding costs during our forecast period, as we have yet to see the bank develop wise strategies to attract and retain retail customers.","We have an Uncertainty Rating for CITIC of High, down from Very High. We believe the bank has achieved some positive outcomes from its three-year business reform since new management came on board in 2019. To gauge uncertainty level among Chinese banks, we review a set of valuation metrics based on seven factors: operating leverage, financial leverage, revenue cyclicality, pricing power, loan quality, policy risk and market risk, according to Morningstar valuation methodology.CITIC's credit quality and property exposure are our key concerns. Citic has reduced its credit risk exposure in property, retail and wholesale and construction sectors. New management?s asset de-risking efforts over the past three years had showed positive progress. The bank's bad debt ratio fell to a new low of 1.21% since 2015 and other leading indicators for asset quality seeing consistent improvement. Lending to property developers accounted for 5.3% of total loans. Such proportion was lower than joint-stock peers but non-performing loan ratio was higher than peers at 5.29%. We expect future provisioning pressure for Citic's property exposure in light of mounting property market risks.We believe CITIC's environmental social and governance, or ESG, risks are low and immaterial to the group. We see failure to meet regulatory requirements, laws, or mis-selling products, and weak internal control as the largest and potentially most material risks the bank must manage. We do not make any specific allowances for potential (unknown) penalties or customer remediation in our base case, given the amount is very small when compared with CITIC's business scale as evidenced by past cases.","We believe China Citic Bank has a Poor Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The bank's loan underwriting is more aggressive than peers, as evidenced by its high off-balance-sheet exposure to property developer loans, such as financing to debt-ridden Evergrande. The bank also has weaker capital position and we expect it to face capital pressures. As of mid-2023, the banks core Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, and capital adequacy ratio were 8.85%, 10.68%, and 13.22%, respectively. Current regulatory minimum ratios for Chinese banks are 7.5%, 8.5%, and 10.5% after considering a 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The guiding opinion on Chinas domestic systematically important banks, or D-SIBs, rules which were released in April 2021 require different additional capital buffers for banks in different buckets. These buffers are 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, respectively for banks in five buckets based on different scores graded on business scale, interconnectedness with other financial institutions, substitutability, and complexity. The additional capital buffer for Citic is to be 0.5%, leading to targeted core Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, and capital adequacy ratio at 8.0%, 9.0%, and 11.0%, respectively. We believe capital pressures for Citic are manageable, as the current core Tier 1 ratio was 85 basis points above the regulatory target. The banks return on equity was 10.80% in 2022. We estimate this will support an about 7% growth in assets over the next three years. Given the governments call to have banks support real economy through bank lending, there will be some pressure for capital raising over the next five years. Chinese regulators have put a floor price for SOEs secondary offer at 0.9 times of their book value. As shares are currently trading at a much larger discount to its book value, we believe the bank will have difficulties in raising capital. The weaker capital position also places dividends at risk. The bank maintains its dividend payout ratio at 26% on average over the past three years, we expect the future dividend payout will remain at around 25%. Technology investment reached CNY 8.7 billion or 4.14% of total revenue in 2022. Key areas of technology investment include big data, cloud computing, block chain, and artificial intelligence. ","As the second-largest joint-stock banks, China Citic Bank is headquartered in Beijing. It offers a full range of commercial banking services, with 1,410 outlets in 146 cities in China and branches in Hong Kong, Macau, New York, Los Angeles, and Singapore. As of 2022, the bank is the 9th-largest nationwide listed commercial bank in China in terms of total assets.","As a result of Citic's fast-growing assets and relatively low profitability, the bank has a weaker-than-peer capital position. Its core Tier 1 capital and its Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios reached 8.85% and 10.68%, respectively as of mid-2023. Both ratios exceed the 8% and 9% minimum requirements under the new capital rules in China. The bank issued CNY 40 billion in A-share convertible bonds in March 2019, which will mature in March 2025. However, given low investor sentiment for the banks, the convertible bonds have yet to complete the conversion.",601998.SS,Financial Services,231878557696.0,SHH,21775200.0,CNY,5.449999809265137,True,0,5.6167901298185186,5.825822769841774,1
25/11/2023,Equifax's Workforce Solutions Segment Is Its Largest Profit Driver,Equifax Inc,EFX,4,19/10/2023,Rajiv Bhatia,210.74,USD,24/11/2023,270.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,B,19/10/2023,"Equifax saw a third quarter somewhat softer than expected as mortgage volumes continue a downward trend. Revenue was $1.32 billion or $1.30 billion excluding its acquisition of Boa Vista, which was just shy of the $1.33 billion FactSet consensus and the firms midpoint guidance of $1.33 billion. We attribute the softness to lower mortgage volumes (mortgage credit inquiries were down 29% in the quarter) and to a lesser extent a stronger dollar weighing on reported results. With mortgage rates continuing to move higher, investors patience on mortgage volumes will be tested, but we believe mortgage volumes will rise over the long term and view Equifaxs shares as attractive at current levels. We will maintain our wide moat rating and $270 fair value estimate on Equifaxs shares. Equifax Workforce Solutions, or EWS, Equifaxs largest segment, grew revenue 3% with nonmortgage revenue growing 11%. Equifax finished the quarter with a 12% year-over-year growth in payroll records, a slight deceleration from 14% in the second quarter but still a solid result, in our view. Government revenue growth of 23% was the star, and Equifax continues to win and extend contracts, notably for Medicaid redetermination and the USDAs SNAP program. Talent solutions revenue growth of 6% was not bad as hiring, particularly for professional workers, continues to be slow. If there was an area of disappointment for us in the nonmortgage verification business, it was consumer lending, which was down 8%. Equifax over-indexes to subprime, which has been hit harder than prime lending. EWS mortgage revenue was down 17%, which was better than the 29% decline in mortgage credit inquiries.","The workforce solutions segment is a fast-growing business built on unique data and can contribute meaningfully to earnings growth. Equifax can increase use cases in nonmortgage applications for income verification. Equifax's businesses lines are capital-light, and incremental revenue tends to flow to the bottom line, generating high returns on invested capital and operating margin expansion. Equifax's acquisitions can further solidify its moat and diversify its lines of business.","Mortgage volumes drive Equifax's core credit bureau business and its workforce solutions segment, but they are difficult to predict, given their sensitivity to mortgage rates and homebuying activity. In addition, higher rates will weigh on the purchasing and refinancing mortgage market. While Equifax is the leader in income verification, its success could attract new entrants.  Equifax faces operational risk related to data security. Another breach could materially affect the firm's ability to win new business or new partnerships.",03/10/2023,"Along with TransUnion and Experian, Equifax is one of the big three credit bureaus. Given the fixed costs inherent in a data-intensive business, Equifax has been able to enjoy strong operating leverage from incremental revenue. As the U.S. credit bureau market is relatively mature, the company has been adding new capabilities and expanding its geographic footprint, both organically and through acquisitions. As an example of its bolt-on acquisition strategy, Equifax announced in January 2021 that it will acquire e-commerce fraud prevention platform Kount for $640 million. Kount builds on Equifaxs existing antifraud products and we think acquiring unique data and software assets makes sense. Equifaxs star in recent years has been its workforce solutions segment, which is now its largest segment. Workforce solutions includes income verification (primarily for mortgages), and we dont believe Equifax has meaningful direct competition for this service. We expect Equifaxs competitive position to persist as the large amount of existing records and the difficulty of convincing employers to share employee information would be too tough for new entrants to overcome. In the years ahead, we expect Equifax to focus on expanding use cases of income verification beyond mortgage to auto, card, government services, and employment screening. Workforce solutions also includes employers services, which consist of employee onboarding solutions, I-9 management, tax form services, and unemployment claims processing. Growth by acquisition in Workforce Solutions has also been a focus, most notably with its $1.8 billion deal to buy Appriss Insights.  Equifaxs reputation took a beating after a well-publicized data breach in September 2017. This wasnt the first time Equifax suffered a data breach; however, the depth and the breadth of the breach created ire among the public and showed that the company wasnt prepared to handle customers data securely. Following the breach, Equifax has invested heavily in cybersecurity and incurred significant legal and product liability costs. In our view, Equifax has largely put the episode behind it.","Overall, we believe Equifax merits a wide moat rating based on intangible assets.Equifaxs data is critical to its customers (often banks) underwriting decisions, and the price of its services is negligible relative to the loan amounts at risk. We estimate that North American credit bureaus revenue represents about 1-2 basis points of total household debt. Because the accuracy and completeness of data is critical to credit decision-making, lenders often pull from more than one credit bureau, and we do not believe pricing is the primary factor for choosing a credit bureau. We believe the barriers to entering the credit bureau business are high, as replicating a database of millions of customers would be incredibly difficult. Because the credit bureaus data is based on the voluntary reporting of thousands of financial institutions, its unlikely that a startup, particularly with heightened data security concerns, could convince banks to share consumer information. Mortgage-related revenue makes up 25% of U.S. information services revenue. Government agencies (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) require a credit report from all three bureaus (known as a tri-merge report in the industry). Given that the bulk of mortgages are agency-compliant, using Equifax (along with TransUnion and Experian) is essentially required for a mortgage lender. However, in October 2022, the Federal Housing Administration announced that it will work toward moving from a tri-merge to a bi-merge which would only require two credit bureau pulls. The timeline for this change is unclear. While this has the potential to expand mortgage credit to more of the population, we view the requirement of going from three credit bureaus to two as a modest negative.The 22% of firmwide revenue that Equifax generates outside the U.S. tends to be lower-margin, with segment adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% versus the firmwide 34%. Given the relatively fixed-cost nature of Equifaxs operations and less amount of scale, we do believe Equifaxs EBITDA margins will improve but still trail the core U.S. business, given the smaller market size in each individual country. Equifaxs workforce solutions segment (45% of revenue and 57% of adjusted EBITDA) has been a key driver of earnings growth. The growth driver has been verification services (about 80% of segment revenue) whereby Equifax offers end users (lenders, employers, government, and so on) the ability to verify a persons income. Given the need to persuade businesses to share sensitive employee income data, we believe this business benefits from a first-mover advantage that allowed it to amass a sizable number of records. We note that margins have meaningfully expanded in recent years as its database has grown. In 2022, Equifax had over 600 million historical employment records, up from 255 million in 2014 and 203 million in 2009. ","Equifax does face some risks related to the macro environment. A tight credit market and a worsening macroeconomic environment could reduce demand for its information. With regard to mortgages, purchasing volumes are not necessarily cyclical and refinance volumes depend largely on interest rates. The Verification Services employment screenings business is tied to the number of new hires. Equifax does have some offsets such as its unemployment claims processing business, which has proved countercyclical. Overall, we assign the firm a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High.Finally, Equifax generates over 20% of its revenue outside the U.S., leading to currency risk. It typically does not hedge this exposure, which could add volatility to the top line, but since there are expenses in foreign currencies, there is a bit of a natural hedge.Equifax is also exposed to environmental, social, and governance risk, the greatest of which are in the areas of data security/privacy and data accuracy. The issue of data security came to the forefront with the well-publicized breach in 2017. Breaches can increase costs and hurt a firms reputation, making it more difficult to win new business and new partners. Workforce Solutions has very strong market share, and the company's operations and practices could face antitrust scrutiny. We note that TALX entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2008 concerning anticompetitive practices. Equifax uses third parties for some of its data, and its business could be disrupted if it lost access to key data suppliers. In addition, the credit bureaus can have negative sentiments from the public, and the industry typically receives tens of thousands of complaints per year. Finally, from a bribery and corruption perspective, Equifax is exposed to cultural, economic, political, and currency risks through its overseas operations.","Overall, we believe Equifax merits an Exemplary capital allocation rating. We believe the firms balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decision are exceptional, and capital returns strategy is appropriate. In particular, we believe the acquisition of TALX for $1.4 billion in 2007 (what today is Workforce Solutions) proved to be very accretive and that today it is worth multiple times what it paid for it. Mark Begor replaced Richard Smith as CEO in April 2018 following the companys well-publicized data breach. Begor joined Equifax from private equity firm Warburg Pincus and before that had a 35-year career at General Electric, leading its retail credit card business (now Synchrony Financial). Begor also served on the board of Fair Isaac. Given his experience in consumer credit and consumer data, we believe Begor was a logical choice and are pleased with his tenure so far. Were generally positive on Equifaxs corporate development activities. We think since acquiring TALX in 2007, management has done a good job building out its workforce solutions segment. This includes getting more employers on its platform, which increases the usefulness of its product as well as expanding use cases for its service. We think Equifaxs acquisitions have made strategic sense. The acquisition of Computer Sciences Corp. was a unique deal in that it was an affiliate and Equifax was obligated to purchase the firm. Equifaxs $1.9 billion acquisition of Veda was a logical move to expand credit reporting services geographically in Australia. Equifaxs other acquisitions include PayNet in 2019 (credit data for small and medium businesses) as well as e-commerce fraud prevention platform Kount (announced in January 2021). While we always keep an eye out for acquisitions that dilute the firms moat, we think these assets will over time solidify the moat and diversify Equifaxs revenue. Given that most of these acquisitions have been or are expected to be accretive to earnings, we do not believe Equifax overpaid for them. In September 2017, Equifax announced that hackers had accessed the company's systems from mid-May to July, including large quantities of sensitive consumer data. This was not the firms first data breach, and compared with peers, Equifax cybersecurity did appear to be antiquated. We also believe management could have handled the breach better in the immediate aftermath. This includes reporting the breach immediately after it was discovered, avoiding public relations missteps, and rethinking the offering of free credit monitoring services with perceived consumer-unfriendly attributes. Additionally, some executives sold stock during the episode, which raised insider trading concerns. That said, were pleased with the firms decision to boost cybersecurity and technology spending. While data and technology security spending is going to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, we believe Equifax has largely put the episode behind it.The firms leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) at the end of 2022 was about 3.2 times by our calculations, which we believe is appropriate. Following the 2017 breach, the firm froze its dividend and suspended share repurchases through early 2021. The firms dividend payout ratio on adjusted earnings has generally been about 20%-30% in recent years, which we think is appropriate. Though share repurchases would have been highly accretive, due to the breach, the firm incurred meaningful one-time costs, and deleveraging improved its cash position.","Along with Experian and TransUnion, Equifax is one of the leading credit bureaus in the United States. Equifaxs credit reports provide credit histories on millions of consumers, and the firm's services are critical to lenders credit decisions. In addition, about a third of the firms revenue comes from workforce solutions, which provides income verification and employer human resources services. Equifax generates over 20% of its revenue from outside the United States.","Equifax management has historically been reasonably conservative with the balance sheet, with leverage ratios (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) between 1.5 and 3.0 times in the past several years. Management has shown a willingness to increase debt after an acquisition. Following the acquisition of Veda in 2016, the leverage ratio went to 3.5 times, but the firm quickly paid some of its debt to reduce leverage. Following the data breach in 2017, leverage increased as the firm incurred significant costs related to the breach.At the end of 2022, Equifax disclosed that it had $5.8 billion in long-term debt and $0.3 billion of cash. On a net leverage basis, we calculate Equifax's leverage at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 was about 3.2 times. We view Equifax's revenue as moderately cyclical and believe this leverage ratio is appropriate for the firm.",EFX,Industrials,27368960000.0,NYQ,1024508.0,USD,210.7400054931641,True,1,189.6950306611906,247.34316142012437,1
24/11/2023,Vogtle Project Completion Begins New Chapter for Southern,Southern Co,SO,3,02/11/2023,Travis Miller,69.59,USD,23/11/2023,68.0,Low,Narrow,Exemplary,B,02/11/2023,"We are reaffirming our $68 fair value estimate for Southern after the company reported $1.42 per share of operating earnings during the third quarter, up from $1.31 in the same quarter in 2022, primarily because of warmer summer weather. We are reaffirming our narrow moat rating. Year-to-date earnings are on track to meet our forecast and management's $3.55-$3.65 EPS guidance range. The third-quarter weather benefit helped offset the first-half earnings drag from a warmer-than-normal winter. Weather is still a $0.09 per share drag through the first three quarters, but that doesn't have a material impact on our fair value estimate or our outlook for 2024 and beyond. Southern still plans to bring the Vogtle 4 new nuclear unit online in early 2024. Management raised its share of total estimated project costs by $160 million to $10.8 billion but also estimated only $258 million is left to spend, limiting the risk of any substantial additional cost overruns. Southern's stock has been one of the top-performing utilities this year, beating the Morningstar US Utilities Index by 15 percentage points. The stock trades in line with our fair value estimate as of Nov. 2. Southern's 4% dividend yield is slightly above the sector median, but we expect only 3% annual dividend growth for at least two more years until Southern's payout ratio falls below 70%. We continue to forecast 6% long-term weather-normalized annual earnings growth, in line with management's 5%-7% target, based on an average $8.6 billion annual capital investment during 2023-25, excluding Vogtle. We think that capital investment run rate could increase when management updates its plan in February based on investment opportunities in Georgia and Alabama along with renewable energy projects at Southern Power. We continue to forecast 2024 weather-normalized earnings in line with management's $3.95-$4.10 post-Vogtle EPS guidance range.","Southern has excellent regulatory relationships due in large part to low utility rates and solid reliability. Although operational performance is the foundation for these relationships, management maintains strong political ties as well. As the new Vogtle nuclear units near completion, cash flow should increase, supporting a stronger balance sheet and faster dividend growth. Business investment and customer growth remains strong in Southern's primary Southeast U.S. service territory, supporting growing energy demand.","Cost overruns at Vogtle and Kemper have added uncertainty to Southern's excellent regulatory relationships and frameworks in Georgia and Mississippi. A change in the constructive ratemaking structures in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi could lead Southern to reduce its $43 billion five-year capital investment plan. Energy efficiency is reducing sales growth, and we expect this trend to continue in the next decade.",05/10/2023,"Southern is undergoing one of the most dramatic transformations in the utilities sector with its plan to invest $43 billion during the next five years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, build renewable energy projects, strengthen the gas system, and support the Southeast region's fast-growing energy demand. In 2000, almost 80% of the electricity Southern sold was generated using coal. That share is now below 20% and falling. The company is aiming to retire all but eight coal plants by 2028 and reach net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. Nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy are all increasing their share of generation. However, the transformation has had hiccups, notably the construction delays and cost overruns at the new Vogtle nuclear units 3 and 4. The units are five years behind schedule and more than double the initial cost estimate, but the project is nearly complete. Unit 3 has begun the startup phase and unit 4 is on schedule to begin operations in early 2024. Vogtle's total capital cost is now set to top $23 billion, with Georgia Power's 45.7% share approximately $10.6 billion net of a $1.7 billion settlement payment from Toshiba, which declared bankruptcy in 2017 in part due to the project's financial challenges. Other setbacks with Southern's transformation were the delays and cost overruns at the Kemper (Mississippi) project, a planned first-of-its-kind lignite coal-to-gas combined-cycle plant with carbon capture. But the project fell three years behind schedule and the budget doubled before Southern decided to run it as a traditional gas plant. Abandoning the lignite-to-gas operation ultimately required a write-off of roughly $6 billion pretax. Although these two projects have stolen headlines and impaired shareholder value, Southern has a long history of solid execution across its businesses. With a renewed focus on smaller projects, we think Southern can produce steady 6% earnings growth. Dividend growth has trailed earnings growth in recent years because of Southern's large investments, but we expect dividend growth to accelerate and match earnings growth starting in 2024 when Vogtle is finished.","We believe Southern has a narrow moat supported by its state-regulated utilities, which represent approximately 90% of its earnings. Service territory monopolies and efficient scale advantages are the primary moat sources for Southern's regulated utilities.State and federal regulators grant Southern exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow it to earn a fair return on and return of the capital it invests to build, operate, and maintain their infrastructure. In exchange for Southern's service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers. We expect returns on invested capital to remain at a modest but consistent spread above Southern's cost of capital for the foreseeable future, supporting our narrow moat rating.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow Southern's utilities to achieve at least their costs of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing.Southern benefits from favorable regulatory environments and fastest-growing local economies in most of its service territories. These factors contribute to the premium returns Southern has earned and its constructive relationships with regulators, the most critical component of a regulated utility's moat.The investment opportunities and regulatory mechanisms that have allowed Southern to earn its best-in-class returns on equity are in large part because of the company's constructive relationships with state regulators in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Southern will have to prove it can build constructive regulatory relationships in more challenging states such as Illinois following its acquisition of AGL. In addition, the delays and cost overruns at the Kemper and Vogtle projects have weighed on earned returns.Southern's competitive generation business benefits from long-term contracts that lock in favorable returns for capacity and energy. Its average contract length is over 10 years and it takes little direct commodity risk.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Southern is Low.We forecast 6% average annual earnings growth now that the new Vogtle nuclear project is nearly complete. We don't anticipate any significant additional cost overruns as unit 4 enters service.Possible environmental legislation and other fossil-fuel regulations are long-term uncertainties, but Southern's investment plan is meant to reduce that environmental risk.Environmental compliance requirements could prove to be less painful to shareholders than some might expect and could actually boost earnings if new regulations lead to additional growth investment opportunities. Achieving Southern's carbon emissions reduction goals will require regulatory support for coal plant closures and new renewable energy.The biggest threat that Southern faces is a deterioration of regulatory relationships in its three retail electric service territories. Much of the company's success hinges on the relationships it has built through years by providing low-cost, reliable electric service. This topnotch operational performance and the constructive regulatory relationships should protect shareholders from any major regulatory setbacks that might impair shareholder value.","We assign Southern an Exemplary capital allocation rating due in large part to management's plan to invest in rate-regulated projects that have strong regulatory support and promote clean energy growth.Despite the Vogtle and Kemper setbacks, we are confident that management will continue to allocate capital prudently and maintain constructive relationships with many stakeholders, from regulators to customers. Management remains focused on constructive relationships with state regulators, which is a crucial driver of utilities' earned returns over the long run.We believe Southern's strong leadership was evident while managing the Westinghouse bankruptcy and persuading Vogtle's partners, regulators, and other government leaders to continue the project. Although the problems at Vogtle have been difficult and reduced near-term returns, the project is nearly complete. We believe management's response to the Kemper and Vogtle problems demonstrates a strong commitment to prudent capital allocation.CEO Chris Womack replaced retiring CEO Thomas Fanning in March 2023. We expect Womackand Fanning, who remains board chairmanto continue Southern's decarbonization strategy, positioning Southern for a long runway of growth. Womack's experience in a variety of roles since joining Southern in 1988 should help him maintain constructive relationships with many stakeholders, a hallmark of Southern's value proposition for shareholders.Fanning leaves with a mixed record as CEO since late 2010. He oversaw two of the industry's largest and most ambitious projects in several decadesthe Kemper (Mississippi) coal gasification plant and two new units at the Vogtle (Georgia) nuclear plant. However, each project ran into financial and operational challenges that ultimately led to shareholder losses. Through year-end 2022, Southern shareholders realized a 220% return, including dividends, with Fanning as CEO, trailing the 240% total return of the Morningstar US Utilities Sector Index during the same time period.","Southern is one of the largest utilities in the U.S. The company serves 9 million customers with vertically integrated electric utilities in three states and natural gas distribution utilities in four states. It owns 50 gigawatts of rate-regulated generating capacity, primarily for serving customers in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Subsidiary Southern Power owns 13 gigawatts of natural gas generation and renewable energy across the U.S. and sells the electricity primarily under long-term contracts.","Southern has stabilized its balance sheet and its credit metrics should continue to improve as the Vogtle project wraps up. Investors should benefit from a jump in cash flow as Southern incorporates its full Vogtle investment into customer rates starting in 2024.The AGL acquisition and Kemper write-downs increased debt/capital to over 67% at 2017 year-end versus 57% in 2015. Asset sales and equity issuances since then have helped Southern improve its balance sheet. We still think Southern can operate with slightly higher leverage than its peers because of its constructive regulatory frameworks.Southern's dividend growth has averaged just 3% annually for the last 10 years, slower than many of its peers' dividend growth. We forecast a 58% payout ratio in 2023 based on an $0.08 per share, or 3%, annualized dividend increase. This is in line with the rest of the regulated utilities industry. We expect dividend growth to accelerate during the next five years as cash flow increases following the completion of the new Vogtle units.",SO,Utilities,78001143808.0,NYQ,3993122.0,USD,69.58999633789062,True,0,66.64943345013765,68.96042962721606,0
24/11/2023,Nomura is Japan's Largest Independent Securities Firm,Nomura Holdings Inc,NMR,3,02/11/2023,Michael Makdad,4.15,USD,23/11/2023,4.2,Medium,,Standard,D,02/11/2023,"We are raising our fair value estimate for Daiwa Securities to JPY 800, or 0.76 times book value, from JPY 650, or 0.62 times book value, while maintaining our estimate for Nomura Holdings at JPY 590, or 0.54 times book value. Daiwas September-quarter ROE of 8.0% outperformed Nomuras 4.3% and our estimate of around 6% for the sector average. Daiwas earnings were well-balanced among its retail, wholesale, and asset-management segments, in contrast to Nomura, which lagged in its global wholesale business even as it enjoyed strong retail-segment profits in Japan. Rather than the earnings performance, though, the main driver for our increase in our fair value estimate for Daiwa is larger shareholder distributions than we previously expected. Daiwa announced a JPY 35 billion share buyback on top of the JPY 25 billion it already completed this fiscal year. That means that the total payout ratio this year, which already reached 81% of earnings in the fiscal first half, is likely to top 100% for the full year, per our estimates. We had previously forecast that Daiwa would pay out 50% of its earnings as dividends and use an additional 20% of its earnings to repurchase shares, for a total shareholder return payout ratio of 70%. We now forecast that Daiwa will have a total shareholder return payout ratio of 75% in future years, after distributing all its earnings and then some this fiscal year. We remain somewhat cautious on our forecasts of Daiwas future earnings, however. We see midcycle ROE for it of around 7.5%, above our forecast for Nomuras midcycle ROE of around 6.0%, but still slightly below the cost of equity given its lack of an economic moat.","Given its business of selling and managing financial assets, Nomura is one of the Japanese companies best positioned to increase earnings quickly in a strongly reflationary macroeconomic scenario. Low investor expectations, due to Nomuras history of expanding and retrenching overseas and occasionally posting big losses, belie the firms inherent strength in its core businesses. Although Nomura has adopted more pay for performance than in past decades, the compensation structure is still more weighted toward fixed costs that create operating leverage in an upswing.","Nomura has posted large unexpected losses several times in its history, such as the JPY 700 billion loss in fiscal 2008, which included exposure to Iceland and the Madoff scheme as well as write-downs of real estate assets.  Nomura relies on bank borrowings and confidence-sensitive market funding, which is a disadvantage vis-a-vis competitors that are part of banking groups with large stable deposits. Nomura has been unable to generate consistently positive returns from its overseas operations.",02/11/2023,"Nomura is Japans largest independent broker, with a market share of around 30% of client assets (stocks, bonds, funds, and so on) held in brokerage accounts in Japan, larger than the 18% held at rival Daiwa Securities and the 10%-17% shares at the securities units of the three megabanks. In investment trusts, Nomuras market share of assets under management in publicly and privately placed funds was 18% as of mid-2023, roughly double the share of its largest rivals.  Japanese people associate the Nomura name with competency in handling such investment products, and it has accumulated decades of know-how in training its branch staff to gather assets and develop long-term relationships of trust with high net-worth individuals. We estimate that the return on equity of Nomuras domestic retail and asset-management businesses has historically been well above 10%.  Meanwhile, Nomuras global wholesale business has no clear advantage competing with foreign securities companies with better connections overseas. Even the European investment banks, which are larger than Nomura and more culturally similar to the U.S., consistently lost share to the U.S.-based banks after the global financial crisis owing to their inability to fully penetrate the U.S. market, which accounts for close to half of the total global fee pool. On its own, Nomura lacks the resources to be more than a niche player, in our view. Despite this fact, Nomura continues to hold more balance sheet risk than it needs to pursue its core business, although it has made some progress in the past few years reducing its high overseas cost structure. Another issue is that Nomura's relatively moaty core business of domestic retail and asset management is facing some erosion of its long-term advantages as its core customer base ages. We think Nomura's traditional approach has less currency with younger generations and the firm needs to enhance its digital offerings to fend off potential competition from internet firms.","We do not believe Nomura has an economic moat. Its lack of scale in its global wholesale business compared with European and especially U.S.-based competitors is too much of a drag on its overall returns, despite the likely presence of narrow moats surrounding its domestic retail and asset-management businesses, where Nomura benefits from the intangible asset of its strong brand name and customer relationships. In Japan, we estimate that Nomura has a market share of around 29% of client assets (stocks, bonds, funds, and so on) held in brokerage accounts, larger than the approximately 18% held at rival Daiwa Securities and the 10%-16% shares at the securities units of the three megabanks, underpinning Nomuras advantage in the retail business. In investment trusts, Nomuras market share of assets under management, or AUM, in publicly and privately placed funds is around 18%, roughly double the share of its largest rivals. Japanese people associate the Nomura name with competency in handling such investment products, and it has accumulated decades of know-how in training its branch staff to gather assets and develop long-term relationships of trust with high-net-worth individuals. We estimate that the ROE of Nomuras domestic retail and asset-management businesses has historically been well above 10%. However, the strengths of the domestic retail and asset-management businesses are diluted by Nomuras subscale global wholesale business, where the firm has no clear long-term advantage competing with foreign securities companies with better connections overseas. Even the European investment banks, which are larger than Nomura and more culturally similar to the U.S., consistently lost share to the U.S.-based banks after the global financial crisis owing to their inability to fully penetrate the U.S. market, which accounts for close to half of the total global fee pool. ","The Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Nomura is Medium. As a securities firm, its earnings are tied to inherently volatile capital markets. Although its domestic retail and asset-management segments have historically been relatively stable, its global wholesale operations have not only failed to earn a decent return on capital over the past two decades, but its returns have been quite volatile, such as in the fiscal year ended March 2009, when the wholesale segment posted a huge pretax loss of JPY 717 billion, or in the fiscal year ended March 2019, when it had a JPY 111 billion pretax loss.Nomura has a history of encountering regulatory sanctions and civil lawsuits from counterparties. Several times in the past, regulatory issues have prompted senior management to resign, but the earnings impact has usually been limited to only a few quarters. That said, we believe that if Nomura were to fall afoul of Japanese regulators in a major way, its future as an independent firm could be in question. We believe Nomura' environmental social and governance, or ESG, risks are moderate and do not pose significant additional aggregate risk beyond the risks we already incorporate in our bear-case scenario. ","We assign a capital allocation rating of Standard to Nomura. Its policy is to pay at least 40% of earnings in each semiannual period in the form of dividends and to aim for a total shareholder return ratio, including both dividends and buybacks, of at least 50%. In fact, the firm has returned almost all its earnings over the past seven years to shareholders (47% in the form of dividends plus another 45% in the form of share buybacks). However, Nomura management has in the past sometimes elected to pursue large acquisitions that ultimately ended up destroying shareholder value.The firm's history is studded with a variety of scandals, most recently an information leak in 2019 and previously an insider-trading scandal in 2012 that forced out the CEO at the time. Although unrelated to the insider-trading scandal that led to his ouster in 2012, former CEO Kenichi Watanabes decision in 2008 to acquire former Lehman Brothers assets in Asia and Europe proved to be a poor one in hindsight, whether because of misguided strategy, inadequate execution, or just bad luck related to unforeseen developments such as the euro crisis. By more than doubling its number of overseas employees from 4,000 to around 11,000 currently, Nomura increased its total costs by more than a quarter, yet revenue did not rise to the same extent, and Nomuras ROE has averaged only 5.5% since 2010. Dilutive equity offerings in 2009 to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and the increased costs have resulted in Nomuras share price staying below JPY 1,000, after having traded consistently above this level (sometimes greatly so) in the quarter century before 2008. ","Nomura is Japans largest broker, about twice the size of rival Daiwa Securities and roughly three times the size of the securities units of the three megabanks. It is also the largest asset-management company in Japan, with a similar size differential compared with its rivals. Despite its topnotch brand name in retail broking and asset management in Japan, Nomura has struggled to compete effectively in the institutional securities business against larger global rivals. In 2008, Nomura bought European and Asian assets of the failed Lehman Brothers, which led to a sharply higher cost base but did not provide commensurate revenue. Nomura has reduced the scale of these businesses but maintains its ambition to compete globally with the top players.","Nomura's consolidated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.7% as of JUne 2023, above the average for global systemically important banks of 12.7% (though Nomura, as a broker, can see more short-term volatility in its risk-weighted assets than commercial banks do, suggesting the need for a buffer if it wanted to maintain similar ratios even during periods of market stress). Its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure had been below the GSIB average but was 5.41% as of June 2023.Nomura has not been included in the list of GSIBs since the Basel-based Financial Stability Board started to designate such banks in 2011, but Japans Financial Services Agency has designed it as a domestic systemically important bank and requires the firm to meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements. Nomura depends on having access to bank and market funding. Of its approximately JPY 12 trillion in unsecured funding, 70% is long-term, with an average maturity of 6.2 years as of March 2023. The company calculates its liquid assets at JPY 7.65 trillion, or 16% of total assets. High Quality Liquid Assets as defined by Basel rules were JPY 6.5 trillion as of June 2023, slightly more than twice the amount of theoretical net cash outflows.",NMR,Financial Services,12510341120.0,NYQ,6320101.0,USD,4.150000095367432,True,0,3.998588250665882,5.103580227602468,1
24/11/2023,"AMC Networks Has Valuable Content and Cable Channels, but Much Larger Competitors Pose Challenges",AMC Networks Inc,AMCX,4,03/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,15.41,USD,23/11/2023,25.0,Very High,Narrow,Standard,C,03/11/2023,"The importance of partnerships was the key theme in AMC Networks third-quarter earnings report as the firm struggles against steadily declining revenue. AMCs small size leaves it in a weakening position as the traditional television business shrinks, cutting into the firms ability to get content in front of audiences and otherwise monetize the content. Wed still prefer the firm find a suitor, but until then, working with better-positioned rivals makes sense, in our view. We are maintaining our $25 fair value estimate. Management was particularly pleased with the success of the recently concluded two-month pop-up of its content on Warner Bros. Discoverys Max streaming service. Several of the seven AMC original series on Max surfaced on daily top 10 lists and helped drive traffic to AMC+ for newer seasons. The firm is also excited about Xumo, the new video platform from Comcast and Charter, which will feature AMC content. Recent comments from Comcast indicate that it views Xumo as a tool to bundle various streaming services. AMCs long-term negotiating position in these relationships is unclear, which is why wed prefer the firm find a permanent home inside a larger media firm. The Max deal, while only an early experiment, doesnt appear to have generated licensing revenue for AMC. Total revenue declined 7% versus a year ago, with streaming growth and a small bump in licensing revenue more than offset by the weak core traditional television business. AMC ended the quarter with 11.1 million total streaming customers across its various services, up from 10.7 million a year ago. The firm has clearly shifted away from pushing AMC+ as a stand-alone offering, instead preferring to view it as an extension of its traditional television offering. Again, this speaks to the firms reliance on other firms to deliver its content. ","AMC has the shows and ratings to increase affiliate fees, decreasing its reliance on the more volatile advertising revenue stream. AMC built a unique niche with its scripted original programming that has generated buzz through Emmy awards and resulted in high ratings. The hype around cord-cutting due to recent subscriber declines has been overblown. Pay-TV subscriptions have been resilient.","AMC's direct competitors own large studios that can produce shows for their own networks or other networks. These competitors are more likely to be approached first by show creators. The streaming landscape is becoming more competitive by the day and the firm's niche offerings may not be able to keep up with the larger competitors.  Larger cable networks have noticed the success of AMC, especially its edgy original content. These larger networks like FX and TNT have deeper pockets and are capable of investing in similar programming.",09/10/2023,"AMC Networks has transformed its flagship AMC channel from a minor cable channel showing classic movies into a premier prestige platform for original scripted content. The transformation provides AMC with growth potential, but this growth remains contingent on AMCs ability to source and cultivate strong original content as well as monetize programs internationally and on streaming platforms. The firm has successfully monetized programs like Better Call Saul with third-party streaming platforms, but the launch of AMC+ may lower the price of future streaming rights if the rights are no longer exclusive.  The firms most widely distributed channel, AMC, reaches 70 million households in the U.S., while WE tv and IFC reach 68 million and 60 million customers, respectively. The shift away from showing lower-rated movies to original content was spurred by the success of shows including Mad Men and The Walking Dead. While AMC has focused on scripted shows, WE tv, traditionally targeted at female audiences, has had success based on unscripted series, and IFC has created a niche around independent films and alternative comedy series. AMCs large audience has given it leverage in negotiating carriage fees with pay-TV distributors, which we expect will continue as carriage agreements expire. AMC is increasingly competing for content with firms that have global reach, including streaming players and increasingly traditional media players. The deeper pockets of these competitors and their ability to monetize content across the globe has and will challenge AMCs ability to source new programs. AMC first moved into the streaming marketplace via more niche platforms like Shudder and Acorn. The firm launched AMC+ in 2020, which offers a selective library of the content from AMC and the other networks. While AMC shows make up the bulk of the content, much of the library is not exclusive. Unlike its larger peers, we expect AMC will continue to license some of its larger shows to other platforms and not turn AMC+ into an all-exclusive service. We think that the firm's shows aimed at key demographics will remain popular with audiences and thus streaming services. ","We assign AMC Networks a narrow moat rating. AMC operates five domestic cable channels and a portfolio of international channels that reach over 350 million subscribers in more than 125 countries. Its primary channel, AMC, regularly ranks in the top 25 cable networks in the U.S., with WE tv just outside. The company expanded its exposure to international markets via the acquisition of Chellomedia, raising the percentage of revenue earned from outside the U.S. to 20%. Our guiding premise in media is that the value of video content continues to increase even as the distribution markets mutate. Despite the changes in consumption patterns, pay-TV penetration remains well above 60% of households in the U.S. Even without a pay-TV subscription, most ""cord cutters"" still consume video content. While over-the-top offerings such as Netflix and Amazon Prime create their own content, both services and the raft of new competitors require deep libraries to gain and retain subscribers. Given the ongoing demand for content, we believe content creation for cable networks is not a zero-sum game, as quality content will always find an outlet.The companys largest network, AMC, reaches over 78 million households subscribing to basic cable in the U.S. The next largest channel, WE tv, is in over 76 million homes, while BBC America is in 73 million. The two smaller channels, IFC and SundanceTV, are in 68 million and 66 million households, respectively. A new entrant into the content space will encounter two major hurdles to launching a either new cable channel or streaming service without widespread distribution or a content library in the U.S. or abroad. First, the cost to create new quality content is very high, especially the higher-quality scripted content on AMC such as The Walking Dead, Preacher, and Better Call Saul. Second, gaining distribution for a cable channel without paying for carriage in many markets for a new company may be nearly impossible, as cable operators have no need for new channels, which only add potential costs down the road. Additionally, firms without established viewer reach or recognition will encounter significant hurdles when jumping into the streaming landscape. Even Apple, with its massive consumer ecosystem and cash balances, has been forced to give away months or even years of free access to build a subscriber base. Over the past 15 years, the AMC networks have positioned themselves as some of the most important platforms for prestige scripted television, with 15 Emmy nominations for outstanding drama series over the last decade with three wins. We believe AMC will continue to prosper as an outlet of choice for creators of original scripted programming that want to leverage the distribution and audience reach that AMC has attained. Beyond prestige programming, AMC has proved its ability to deliver a large audience for its shows, given the success of The Walking Dead. Even though ratings have dropped from the peak audiences of 17 million plus, the show remains a hit on both cable and streaming with viewers in the key demographic of viewers ages 18-49. ","Based on the exceptionally competitive media market that AMC operates in along with the relatively high level of advertising revenue that is exposed to the economy and economic cycles, and the range of return outcomes used by our star rating system, we believe a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is most appropriate for AMC.AMC faces several secular risks in addition to its economic sensitivity that stems from its cable networks depending heavily on advertising (about 35% revenue), which is economically sensitive.Competition from larger general entertainment networks, which also generate original content, could cause AMC's viewership to decline. The firm remains dependent on the cable bundle to generate affiliate fee and ad revenue, so an acceleration of cord-cutting would hurt the firm. AMCs success remains contingent on its ability to source and cultivate strong original content as well as monetize the programs internationally. The increased interest in original scripted content from traditional cable networks, premium cable networks, and streaming platforms like Netflix could cause the cost of acquisition for original programming to rise dramatically, hitting margins. AMCs overseas expansion exposes the company to country-specific regulatory risks as well as potential foreign-exchange headwinds.While AMC continues to sell some of its programs to third-party streamers like Netflix, the firm is increasingly moving to a digital niche streaming strategy. This move increases the firms exposure to a highly competitive market that includes multiple players that have not only much deeper pockets, but also stronger technology capabilities and deeper content libraries. We have also examined environmental, social, and governance risks for AMC while examining our Uncertainty Rating. While we dont see any material issues right now, we would like to see the firm improve its ESG disclosure policies to increase our confidence that it is managing risks appropriately.","We assign AMC Networks a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. Our rating is driven primarily by the likelihood that AMC adds value through investments but also takes into account the shape of its balance sheet and its shareholder distributions.Include a cash balance of $764 million, net debt was under $2 billion at the end of March 2023, a reasonable level for a firm that generated over $360 million in free cash flow on average for the previous five years. We think that the firm would increase its leverage to make any large-scale acquisitions and it has the ability to do so.AMC returned over $800 million to shareholders via share repurchases over the last five years. While the cash was available, we view the level of repurchases as slightly high for a company that largely had a sub $3 billion market cap for most of this time. While we did view the shares as undervalued during much of this period, we think that AMC should be allocating more of its cash flow to investing in more third-party rights for its streaming platform and further expanding its content creation studios. AMC operates in a highly competitive landscape in which many of its larger peers are transitioning to a direct-to-consumer focus or adding a DTC offering like Disney+, Peacock (NBCUniversal) or Paramount+ (ViacomCBS). Unlike Disney, AMC is running a split DTC strategy under which the firm operates a few niche streaming platforms like Acorn or Shudder while still selling the streaming rights for its original series to larger players like Netflix or Amazon. Given the increased competitive landscape and the rising costs of content production, we view increased content investment by AMC as necessary, but it brings increasingly higher risk of lower returns or even failure.","AMC Networks owns several cable networks, including flagship AMC, WE tv, BBC America, IFC, and SundanceTV. AMC, the most widely distributed channel, reaches more than 70 million pay-TV households in the U.S. Over the last decade, AMC shifted its focus to original scripted programming from classic movies. WE tv targets a female audience and reaches roughly 68 million households. IFC mainly shows independent films and alternative comedy series. AMC also operates a number of niche streaming platforms including Acorn (focused on British shows) and Shudder (focused on horror programming). The firm launched AMC+, a streaming platform for its own content in 2020. ","AMC has a sound balance sheet and is in decent financial shape. Unlike some of its peers, AMC decreased its debt load during 2020 to $2.8 billion and ended 2021 at the same level. With $764 million of cash, net debt is $2 billion as of March 2023, a reasonable level for a firm that generated over $390 million in free cash flow on average for the previous four years even with a $143 million impairment charge for a one-time litigation settlement in 2021. Since the firm currently does not pay a dividend, we expect that any cash flow over the next few years will be used to reinvest in the business, repurchase stock, and repay debt.",AMCX,Communication Services,703887552.0,NMS,333350.0,USD,15.40999984741211,True,1,12.338823497997648,16.134938310690124,1
24/11/2023,Criteo's Dependence on Retargeting Lessened but Macro Headwinds Remain,Criteo SA,CRTO,4,02/11/2023,Ali Mogharabi,24.52,USD,23/11/2023,41.0,Very High,,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"We are maintaining our $41 fair value estimate on Criteo. Our takeaways from Criteo's third-quarter results and the firm's earnings call are mostly positive. First, strong organic growth in retail media, combined with the contribution from the Iponweb acquisition, have reduced the firm's dependency on the declining retargeting business, which for the first time represented less than half of total revenue in the quarter. Second, Criteo's one-stop-shop strategy is becoming more critical as some retailers are putting pricing pressure on the supply side. As advertisers and retailers demand more direct relationships with one another for digital ad buying and selling and first-party data usage, we think Criteo's complete ad-tech stack and focus on retail will continue to differentiate it from its peers. And third, while one of Criteo's largest retail clients has decided to do some of its retail media in-house, the recurring fee that Criteo will continue to receive for its underlying technology will drive further margin expansion starting in 2025. While we continue to rate Criteo as a no-moat company given its platform's lack of a network effect and minimal switching costs for its clients, the firm's full offering could lessen the impact of client decisions to develop similar offerings in-house. We reduced our 2024 net revenue projection for Criteo given the client decision, but increased margin assumptions offset the impact on our fair value estimate. The stock is down nearly 12% in reaction to Criteo's client news and is now trading at a 40% discount to our fair value estimate.","With a focus on delivering high returns on investment for its clients, Criteo should be one of the main beneficiaries of a shift to digital ad dollars in retail and other verticals. With Criteos programmatic digital display ads, the role of ad agencies will be diminished, which will drive Criteo's margins higher. Criteo may soon design a feature to circumvent Apples ITP and again attain user behavior data.","Increased installations of ad-blocking software could reduce Criteo's revenue drastically if they were to eliminate the Criteo Engines effectiveness. Googles DoubleClick and its increasing presence on the demand-side platform will push out Criteo and other demand-side ad-tech companies. Other browser providers could offer features similar to Apples ITP, preventing Criteo from collecting enough data to analyze user behavior, which will negatively affect the firms high-ROI ad purchasing and placement for its clients.",14/02/2023,"On the back of the growing digital ad market, Criteo stood out among many ad-tech companies in 2022 as it added clients, increased its top line, and expanded margins to remain profitable and cash flow positive. However, limitations brought forth by Apples Intelligent Tracking Prevention, or ITP, and its removal of Identifiers for Advertisers, or IDFA, and Googles plan to abandon third-party cookies in 2024 adversely affected Criteos ability to capture additional user data, in turn weighing on the firms machine-learning capabilities, ad purchase and placement, and client growth. For this reason, we view Criteo as a no-moat company. With platforms that attract both retailers ad buyers and sellers, we think Criteo is well positioned to benefit from the growing global retail media digital ad market. We agree with some industry studies that project the market to grow at around 10% annually, to $160 billion, by 2027. Criteo manages the ad supply for various retailers and applies first-party customer data to make those inventories more attractive to advertisers. While the value of retargeting, which still represents nearly 50% of net revenue, has diminished due to the diminishing value of third-party cookies, we think Criteo's relationship with many retailers and its offering to both sell their ad inventories and also implement their omnichannel marketing strategies positions the firm to benefit from growth in retail media ad spending. While the decisions by Apple and Google have continued to pressure top-line growth, the firm remains profitable We think net revenue growth acceleration driven by further adoption of its platform by publishers and advertisers, in addition to acquisitions like that of the supply-side platform provider Iponweb in 2022, will expand Criteos margins through 2027.  ","While Criteo still benefits from network effects and intangible assets consisting of machine learning technology and collection of user behavior and product data, we do not believe such economic moat factors are maintainable. Limitations brought forth by Apples Intelligent Tracking Prevention, or ITP, and its removal of Identifiers for Advertisers, or IDFA, and Googles plan to abandon third-party cookies in 2024 adversely affect Criteos ability to capture additional user data, in turn weighing on the firms machine-learning capabilities, ad purchase and placement, and client growth. For these reasons, we believe it is not likely that the firm will generate excess return on capital over the next 10 years. We believe that user behavior data was the key to Criteo's success, and an inability to collect data can disrupt the digital ad sale and purchase process. With less data, Criteo is less effective in calculating the probability that a user will engage with an ad. In turn, advertisers may see a lower ROI on such ads and, similarly, may run fewer ads through Criteo in the future.Prior to moves by Apple and Google, Criteos platform had created a heterogenous network effect due to the positive virtuous cycle and incremental value it created for advertisers and publishers as the platform gained scale. As its clients ads drove more revenue for the client (say, online clothing sales at Macys), more clients jumped on board. In turn, Criteos offering was more attractive to publishers, which resulted in improved access to inventory and data, which then drove more sales and ROI for clients. Higher ROI drove higher client spending and attracted more publishers, providing Criteo with more access to inventory, which allowed the company to deliver more ads. With more ads, Criteo gathered more data which the firm utilized to make its ads more effective, creating value for clients and helping to bring in more clients and campaigns. Such network effect dissipated mainly due to heightened uncertainty about the firms access to user behavior data.","Our fair value uncertainty rating for Criteo is very high. Given Criteos dependence on the well-being of the economy and overall consumption, the firm would be affected by macroeconomic trends such as a decline in consumption and discretionary spending. In terms of revenue, such risk is partially offset given the continuing mix shift in retail from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, which would be accommodated by more digital spending during the next three to five years. However, Criteos profitability would be hurt.While Criteos direct relations with publishers continues to grow, most of its revenue remains based on ad impressions purchased from intermediaries. In addition, the firms direct agreements with publishers are not long-term. There could be a disruption in Criteos access to ad inventory for a variety of reasons at any time, which could drive revenue much lower and traffic acquisition costs much higher. Such disruption could come about from larger players in the online ad space, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta, shifting focus more toward the demand side and possibly pushing out smaller players such as Criteo.An increase in downloads of ad-blocking software and applications poses a real threat to ad revenue generated by Criteo. The firm remains dependent on individual tracking data resources. Apples ITP and IDFA decisions, along with Googles plan to no longer accept cookie nor cookie-substitutes beginning in 2024, has placed the firms main business model at risk. While cookie alternatives (such as The Trade Desks UID 2.0) may lessen the impact, the firms high dependence on user data also represents an ESG risk. Consumers and regulatory agencies worldwide are demanding data privacy and security. ","We assess the capital allocation of Criteo as Standard.The management team continues to make investments (via acquisitions) in current offerings and to spur innovation and create new products. For example, while making various acquisitions to enhance Criteos mobile analytics and email marketing channel offerings since 2013, the company also acquired assets to speed up innovation, such as creating retail ad campaigns for use in the search engine marketing environment. Criteo also acquired HookLogic, a leading performance marketing exchange provider for consumer brand manufacturers, in late 2016, with the intention to increase demand for Criteo's performance-based marketing services by bringing on consumer brand manufacturers.In 2018, Criteo bought Manage, an in-app programmatic ad buyer. While we think managements attempt to diversify the firms offerings is commendable, especially given the potential impact of Apples ITP and data limitations imposed by Google, returns on those moves by this no-moat firm face very high uncertainty. For example, while Criteos latest offerings are based less on real-time user behavior data and more on client data, to which Criteo has access, the inability to compile more data is likely to lessen the value of the data the company has at hand. In addition, while the purchase of Manage helped maintain Criteos client retention rate, it did not create a switching cost moat source for the firm.The firm also purchased Iponweb in 2022 to enhance its supply-side platform with focus on the retail media market within digital advertising. While Criteo has been profitable historically and has generated free cash flow every year since 2014, the firm has continued to invest in R&D as innovation is one of the main organic growth drivers. Such capital allocation benefited shareholders until the European Commission decided to enforce data privacy by announcing the GDPR in 2016 and implementing it in 2018. We believe the firm will continue to spend 7%-8% of gross revenue on R&D. We do not see Criteo distributing dividends to shareholders; however, it began to aggressively repurchase shares in 2019. The firm allocated around $100 million to share buybacks in 2019 and 2020 and launched another $100 million and $200 million stock buyback in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Criteo was founded in 2005 in Paris by Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, Romain Niccoli, and Franck Le Ouay. Rudelle was CEO until January 2016, when he became executive chairman. In April 2018, Rudelle returned as CEO to get the company back on the innovative front. In November 2019, the firm named Megan Clarken, former chief commercial officer of Nielsen, as its new CEO. According to the firm, Clarken will continue to increase investments in research and new product development, a strategy initiated by Rudelle. Sarah Glickman became CFO in September 2020, after the departure of Benoit Fouilland. Before joining Criteo, Glickman was the acting CFO at XPO Logistics. She also served as operational CFO at Novartis and Honeywell International.","Headquartered in Paris, Criteo is one of the leading ad-tech companies in the digital advertising market. Its technology, allows retailer advertisers to launch multichannel and cross-device marketing campaigns in real time. With real-time return on investment analysis of the ads, the firms clients can adjust their marketing strategies dynamically. The firm also provides technology allowing retailers to effectively manage their ad inventories and improve yield optimization. ","Criteo has a strong balance sheet with $348 million in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt at the end of 2022. In a space where continuing investments in innovation and product enhancement are required to remain competitive, we believe the company is well positioned in terms of access to capital.Criteo generated $256 million in cash from operations in 2022. We expect it to generate free cash flow going forward. The firms free cash flow to equity to gross revenue ratio averaged 8% in the last three years, and we project this ratio to improve to 12% by 2027 as a result of operating margin expansion, with only single-digit top-line growth.",CRTO,Communication Services,1408255872.0,NMS,414855.0,USD,24.520000457763672,True,1,28.350705831188225,28.0712961032037,1
24/11/2023,Continental Has Growth Potential in Automotive Electronics and Active Safety,Continental AG,CON,5,08/11/2023,Richard Hilgert,68.96,EUR,23/11/2023,162.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,08/11/2023,"Narrow-moat-rated Continental reported disappointing third-quarter earnings per share before special items of EUR 1.63, missing the EUR 1.87 FactSet consensus by EUR 0.24 but EUR 2.47 better than the EUR 0.84 loss a year ago as supply chain disruptions lessened but inflationary cost pressures and currency offset. Consolidated revenue missed consensus by 2% and slipped 2% to EUR 10.2 billion from EUR 10.4 billion last year, while organic revenue increased 3%. Automotive organic revenue increased 5%, flat with global light vehicle production. Tire organic revenue was nearly flat, up 0.3% even though volume slipped 3%, due to pricing and mix. ContiTech organic revenue rose 1% mostly on automotive volume growth and customer recoveries, but weaker industrial volume. Adjusted EBIT was EUR 637 million for a 6.2% margin, up from EUR 605 million and a 5.8% margin last year as favorable automotive operating leverage was partially offset by inflationary cost pressures, minor supply chain disruption, and negative currency effect. Inflation was a EUR 330 million headwind in the quarter and Continental tags a EUR 1.4 billion 2023 total headwind. Free cash flow was EUR 466 million versus negative EUR 496 million last year on improved earnings, working capital, and lower capital spending. Management reduced 2023 revenue guidance to EUR 41.0-EUR 43.0 billion, down from EUR 41.5-EUR 44.5 billion due primarily to currency translation. Adjusted EBIT margin guidance remains 5.5%-6.5%. We reduced our 2023 revenue estimate to EUR 42.0 billion from EUR 43.0 billion. Our 2023 assumptions reflect the midpoint of revenue guidance and the low end of margin due to risks we see from industry headwinds in 2023. The 5-star-rated shares of Continental currently trade at a compelling 60% discount to our unchanged EUR 162 fair value estimate.","Continental is well positioned to capitalize on auto industry trends like safety, electronics, connectivity, and automated driving. As a result, we expect the company's revenue to average growth in excess of average annual growth in global light vehicle production. The ability to continuously innovate new process and product technologies should enable Continental to maintain a narrow economic moat. A global manufacturing footprint enables participation in global vehicle platforms and provides penetration in developing markets.","The cyclical, capital-intensive nature of the automotive industry can cause companies to experience substantial swings in profitability. New-car markets are highly competitive, forcing automakers to slash costs wherever possible. Standard industry supply agreements can include annual contractual price declines of as much as 5%, seriously eroding vendor's margins. Raw material costs including rubber, synthetic rubber (petroleum-based), plastics (petroleum-based), steel, copper, and aluminum are volatile, adding a degree of uncertainty to margin.",08/11/2023,"Considering industry trends in connectivity, electronics, and safety, we think Continental's revenue will grow by roughly 2-4 percentage points more than our estimated 1%-3% long-term average annual growth in global vehicle production. Above-industry-average research and development spending enables consistent product and process innovation, supporting Continental's revenue growth, healthy return on invested capital, and a narrow economic moat rating. After an acquisition binge that culminated in 2007 with the purchase of Siemens VDO, Continental has grown from being predominantly a European tiremaker to a global supplier of automotive components, systems, and modules. In 2008, Continental became an acquisition target as Schaeffler unsuccessfully bid for the company (Schaeffler still owns 46% of the voting interest). Even so, management spun off its powertrain division in September 2021 into a new company called Vitesco that trades under the ticker VTSC. Continental has a small amount of contract manufacturing for Vitesco from parts made in previously shared facilities. Continental should benefit from automotive industry trends, including advanced driver-assist systems, autonomous driving features, V2X connectivity, and increased vehicular electronics. The company invests in and successfully cultivates innovative technologies. We think Continental's innovation combined with industry trends plus the offering of premium tires in passenger-vehicle, commercial-vehicle, bus, and two-wheeler markets results in revenue growth and margins that are better than industry averages. Management's long-term targets are to annually increase revenue in excess of 5% and generate adjusted EBIT margins in the 8% to 11% range.","Generating excess returns over its cost of capital of 5.1 percentage points on average since 2002, Continental has a narrow economic moat that flows from its intellectual property, high customer switching costs, and cost advantages (tires). Generally, suppliers like Continental that consistently produce economic profits that translate into solid returns for investors have a substantial global manufacturing presence, a well-diversified customer base, highly integrated and long-term customer ties, and moderate pricing power. Additionally, some portions of the parts supply industry, such as complete passive safety systems, are oligopolistic, limiting automotive manufacturers' vendor choices. Manufacturers of automotive original equipment want vendors that can supply their requirements globally. To reduce cost, the underlying structure of a vehicle produced in Europe may be the same as another vehicle manufactured in the U.S., Japan, or China. Also, some countries have local content laws that require a certain percentage of components be sourced from within that country.Winning a contract to supply a major component or system for a global vehicle program requires a supplier with a substantial global manufacturing presence. Developing a sizable manufacturing footprint requires an enormous capital investment, which provides a substantial barrier to entry for potential competitors, particularly given auto suppliers' uncertain prospects of economic profit. Continental has 519 locations in 57 countries. Not all OEMs are created equal. Barring a global economic meltdown, suppliers with a diversified OEM customer base have a better probability of more consistent revenue streams than companies that rely heavily on any one manufacturer or geographic region. A diversified customer base enables suppliers to reap the benefit of differences in the level of demand in varying global regions. Additionally, customer diversity reduces the risk to the supplier that any one particular vehicle program may fail, by increasing the chances for supplying a highly successful model. Suppliers with a diverse customer base are also more likely to achieve targeted pricing for a product that represents a valuable innovation or substantial cost savings derived from a technologically advanced manufacturing process. The company's top five customers include Ford, Mercedes-Benz, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Stellantis, and Volkswagen, representing about 32% of total revenue. Close ties with OEM customers are critical to success in the automotive industry supply base and create another significant barrier to entry. New-vehicle development cycle times can be up to 36 months. For complex vehicle systems, engineers are involved early in the development process. For example, the brake system is an integral part of vehicular operation. The system must be engineered in such a way that safety regulations are met and the vehicle is able to stop within a reasonable distance; if the specifications require, it includes antilock technology, performs stability control functions, and assists in emergency braking. The requirements for each vehicle are vastly different and require varying degrees of engineering and supplier involvement. For example, brakes for a Fiat 500 would not require the robust engineering and the electronics of a Mercedes S-class brake system, which would not require the stopping performance of the brake system in a Ferrari. Once launched, most vehicle programs have a 5-10-year lifecycle, ensuring some suppliers long-term contractual streams of revenue, albeit subject to volume changes dependent on consumer demand. When a vehicle nameplate has a complete redesign, and a particular supplier that has provided a specific component or system is on the predecessor program, that company typically becomes the incumbent supplier for the redesigned successor vehicle program. In total, suppliers generally have a 6- 13-year tie-up with each customer's vehicle program. The OEM customers of certain suppliers would incur prohibitively high switching costs should they decide to withdraw business in the middle of a vehicle program, especially when a supply agreement is in place for a complex, highly engineered, critical vehicular system. Costs for switching to another supplier would include the substantial lead time and investment to develop and validate a new system, the potential for production disruptions during transition, and the cost of moving large, expensive heavy equipment and tooling. The whole process of changing a critical supplier might cost an OEM as little as a few million dollars to as much as several hundred million dollars, depending on the size and scope of the components or systems being replaced. Consistent product or process technology innovation, combined with the ability to commercialize new technology, enables more favorable pricing relative to many automotive industry suppliers overall. Suppliers cannot simply cost-cut their way to prosperity and must support measures to expand the top line. Even so, a single innovation in a highly competitive industry represents a temporary advantage at best, by no means creating an economic moat, as competition can quickly adapt to or even outright copy the technology. However, the frequent, consistent development of innovative products and processes enables a pipeline filled with individual competitive advantages, generating a steady stream of economic profits, potentially flowing into a narrow economic moat. Continental does not disclose the number of patents owned but, during the past 15 years, average research and development spending has been substantial at 6.7% of revenue, net of customer reimbursements. Automakers are willing to pay for components and systems that provide substantial product differentiation, weight reduction, enhanced safety, reduced cost, or a unique cost-effective solution to meeting regulatory requirements. Pricing power is further enhanced for suppliers with diverse customer bases in varying geographic locations as innovative technology can then be reserved for customers that are willing to meet the suppliers' pricing objectives. Continental possesses the ability to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital, making for a compelling investment. Substantial barriers to entry for competitors exist due to Continental's established global manufacturing presence and the company's long-standing customer relationships, high customer switching costs, and intellectual property. Suppliers that have invested heavily in developing their global presence are in a competitively better position if they are able to substantially diversify their customer base like Continental. Customers' switching costs can be prohibitively high, in combination with the integral nature of the supplier/customer relationship, making Continental's market shares very sticky. Lean manufacturing practices and technological innovation are the mere price of entry into the automotive supplier industry. However, there are only a few that have engrained lean manufacturing into their culture and even fewer like Continental that have successfully generated product or process innovations that regularly translate into a consistent stream of competitive advantages.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Continental is High. The firm operates in the cyclical, capital-intensive, highly competitive automotive-parts industry. Risk factors include fluctuations in global vehicle production from economic cycles and the volatile costs of commodities like steel, rubber, petroleum, plastic resins, and copper. The microchip shortage also represents risk to volume through 2024. Annual contractual price reductions are the industry norm so Continental has to aggressively employ kaizen, kan ban, and Six Sigma lean manufacturing programs to save costs.Since the company operates in a capital-intensive industry subject to cyclical demand, it has a high degree of operating leverage, so sudden declines in volume can have a meaningful impact on profit. Conversely, any sudden increase in sales following large cost-cutting measures significantly raises profits. The potential challenges to profitability brought on by volatile commodity costs, the firm's operating leverage, and by cyclical demand result in our high fair value uncertainty rating.Continental has some environmental, social, and governance risk exposure, which we include in our high uncertainty rating. Continental supplies the global automotive industry, which is transitioning to zero-emission electric vehicles from GHG emitting internal combustion engines. After the powertrain segment spinoff, most of the company's technologies are agnostic to powertrain (ICE and EV need connectivity, brakes, tires, and can use advanced driver-assist and automated driving technologies). Even though all automotive suppliers have product governance risk exposure from potential recalls, various governments' safety regulation compliance increases scrutiny. Continental's products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain highly skilled human capital with expertise in software and various engineering disciplines.","We assign Continental a Standard capital allocation rating, which reflects our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized maintainable midcycle, we estimate Continental's return on invested capital exceeds its weighted average cost of capital by 2.4 percentage points.The balance sheet is sound, with 1.6 times net debt/EBITDA and a net debt/total capital ratio of 31% at the end of December 2022. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound. Despite being an acquisitive company, since 2012, net debt/EBITDA and net debt/total capital have averaged 1.1 times and 24%, respectively. Management targets a 40% to 60% gearing ratio range (41% historical average since 2012) and investment-grade credit ratings. During the same time frame, the company has returned roughly $6.4 billion to investors in the form of stock dividends. Despite suspending dividends from 2008 to 2010 due to the financial crisis and again in 2020 because of the pandemic, Continental's median dividend payout ratio during the past 15 years is approximately 26%. Management targets dividend payout ratios in the 15%-30% range.We applaud Continental for targeting excess returns above weighted cost of capital as a means to long-term value creation. One manifestation of an economic moat that we look for is the consistent generation of excess returns, also known as economic profit.After the surprise announcement on Oct. 29, 2020, that Continentals CEO Dr. Elmer Degenhart was stepping down due to health reasons, the company announced Nov. 12, 2020, that the Supervisory Board named Nikolai Setzer as the new CEO. Dr. Degenhart had about another four years remaining on his contract term and had served 11 years in the CEO role.We like Mr. Setzers credentials, having been with the company for 23 years. He has served in various roles, including head of passenger tires in 2009, he led the tire group beginning in 2011, corporate purchasing in 2015, and was responsible for the automotive group business strategy since April 2019. The Supervisory Board granted Mr. Setzer a term as CEO until March 2024, effective Dec. 1, 2020. We believe continuity of management and execution of restructuring plans remain in place.Being a German company, Continental is governed by a supervisory board and an executive board. The supervisory board has 20 members, half elected by shareholders and the other half elected by Continental's employees. We do not like that the executive board is elected for four-year terms, but the entire supervisory board membership is up for re-election annually, giving shareholders an opportunity to make major changes if required. The company is exposed to significant influence from Schaeffler Group through a supervisory board member and stock ownership with 46% of Continental common stock voting rights controlled by two family members, Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann (stepped down from the board in 2022) and her son, Georg F.W. Schaeffler. The family also controls 75% of auto supplier Schaeffler AG. Georg Schaeffler has a seat on Continental's supervisory board. The remainder of the supervisory board members collectively hold less than 1% of the company's common stock, and the same is true for the executive board. The supervisory board appoints, oversees, and advises the seven-member executive board, which is directly responsible for the management of the company. In our opinion, the supervisory board's members contain sufficient automotive industry experience.","Continental is a global auto supplier and tiremaker. Operating segments include the automotive group (electrical architecture and networking, autonomous mobility, safety and motion, smart mobility, and user experience), tires, and ContiTech which uses rubber in industrial and automotive components and systems. Last year, automotive group revenue was around 48% of the total, tire was 35%, ContiTech was 16%, and contract manufacturing for Vitesco was 1%. Top five customers include Ford, Mercedes-Benz, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Stellantis, and Volkswagen, representing about 32% of total revenue. Europe, at 47% of total revenue, is the companies largest market, followed by North America at 27%, Asia (mostly China) at 22%, and 4% in other regions.","Continental's financial health appears to be in good shape. Management targets investment-grade credit ratings and a gearing ratio (net debt/equity) range of 40% to 60%. At the end of 2022, the company's liquidity was EUR 7.7 billion, the gearing ratio was 46%, and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which treats operating leases as debt and rent expense as interest, was 3.7 times. Since 2012, Continental has averaged 2.1 times total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, while netting cash against debt results in about a 1.4 times ratio. We believe Continental's cash generation and liquidity are more than sufficient to buffer a cyclical downturn in auto demand, including lingering effects of the pandemic and the microchip shortage.By the end of 2006, Continental had reduced its debt to a more prudent level after its acquisitions made between 1998 and 2004. The capital structure became heavily debt-laden in 2007 when management made four acquisitions: Siemens VDO, Matador, Thermopol, and AP Italia. As a result, the company went through the financial crisis with a highly leveraged balance sheet, and debt levels remained elevated through 2013. Since 2012, the gearing ratio has averaged 41%. However, since 2014, Continental's gearing ratio has averaged only 34%.The company has mostly used bank credit lines but also has outstanding bonds, securitization, factoring, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and capital leases, all of which are on balance sheet. Maturities appear well laddered with the exception of roughly EUR 3.7 billion in short-term debt. The company has EUR 6.2 billion in open credit lines, of which, EUR 4.6 billion was available at year-end 2022. While Continental's EUR 4.0 billion revolving bank line of credit due in 2025 had EUR 300 million utilized, short-term debt includes EUR 1.3 billion outstanding on other lines of credit. The large short-term debt balance has typically been rolled to the next year.",CON.DE,Consumer Cyclical,14184425472.0,GER,29298.0,EUR,68.91999816894531,True,1,66.48206908127702,73.2219273210952,1
24/11/2023,Federated Hermes Will Lose Money Market AUM Over Time as Investors Re-Risk Their Portfolios,Federated Hermes Inc,FHI,3,,Greggory Warren,31.59,USD,23/11/2023,36.0,High,,Standard,A,,No Text Available,"With $525.1 billion in money market assets at the end of September 2023, Federated is one of the largest domestic money market managers, despite holding less than 10% of the market Federated has historically taken advantage of its position as a scale player in the money market business to pick up additional assets, especially as other asset managers look to unwind part or all their cash management offerings. Federated's equity and fixed-income strategies have generally posted solid investment performance, providing the firm with a platform of competitive funds for investors.","Federated's prime money market AUM, which generates higher fees than its other cash management offerings, has been negatively affected by the adoption of floating NAVs, redemption fees and other restrictions. With 64% of its money market AUM in government agency and Treasury funds, Federated has to waive fees on a large part of its business during periods of extremely low interest rates. Federated still lacks the scale necessary in its equity, multi-asset, fixed-income and alternative offerings to offset the losses it would see if there were large outflows from its money market funds.",16/11/2023,"Several issues have made it increasingly difficult for asset managers that are running predominantly active portfolios to generate positive organic AUM growth. Poor relative active investment performance, the growth and acceptance of low-cost index-based products, and the expanding power of the retail-advised channel are leaving them more dependent on market gains to increase their managed assets. We believe there will always be room for active management, but the advantage of getting and retaining placement on platforms will go to asset managers with greater scale, established brands, solid long-term performance, and reasonable fees. Despite Federated Hermes having $715.2 billion in assets under management, or AUM, at the end of September 2023, a lack of diversification in its managed assetswith equities accounting for 11% of AUM, fixed-income at 13%, alternatives at 3%, multi-asset products at less than 1%, and money market funds at 73%has kept the firm from leveraging its size and scale to drive solid long-term organic AUM growth or above-average profitability, with Federated's adjusted operating margins of 27.3% on average during 2018-22 being below the group average of 30%.  As for organic AUM growth, during the past five (10) calendar years the company's organic growth rate for its long-term managed assets averaged negative 1.8% (negative 0.3%) with a standard deviation of 5.4% (4.6%). Federated's equity platform was in net outflow mode for much of 2018-22 (losing more than 35% of its AUM to net redemptions). This was offset somewhat by $13.8 billion in fixed-income inflows (with $23.9 billion coming in during 2020-21). With equity and credit markets likely to remain more volatile the next several years, we expect Federated to generate negative 1.2% organic long-term AUM growth on average during 2023-27. While flows into money market funds in response to the equity and credit market volatility could lift overall AUM, it will come at a cost of lower fees and a lower revenue realization rate for the firm. Over time, though, Federated will lose money market AUM as investors re-risk their portfolios.","We believe the asset-management business can be conducive to the creation of economic moats, with switching costs and intangible assets being the most durable sources of competitive advantage for firms in the industry. Although the switching costs might not be explicitly large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results by moving from one asset manager to another tend to keep investors invested in funds for extended periods. As a result, money that flows into asset-management firms tends to stay there. For the industry overall, the average narrow redemption (retention) rate, which does not include exchange redemptions, has been 25% or less (75% or greater) annually the past 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year time frames. Including exchange redemptions, the rate has been less than 30% (greater than 70%). In Federated's case, the firm's average annual redemption (retention) rate for its long-term AUM was 31% (69%) during both the past five and 10 years, roughly in line with the industry average. During 2018-22 (2013-22), Federated's organic growth rate for its long-term AUM (which excludes money market funds) averaged negative 1.8% (negative 0.2%) with a standard deviation of 5.4% (4.6%), which meant the firm was struggling on average to compensate for investor redemptions with new flows into its equity, multi-asset, fixed-income, and alternative asset funds. Even so, this was better than the negative 2.7% (negative 1.7%) rate of organic AUM growth we saw from all actively managed funds during 2018-22 (2013-22). Going forward, we expect the firm will generate negative 1.2% average annual organic growth with its long-term AUM during 2023-27, with a standard deviation of 2.2%. By these measures, we believe Federated has an average switching cost profile when compared with the industry and our coverage group.We believe the traditional asset managers can improve on the switching cost advantage inherent in their business models with organizational attributes (such as product mix, distribution channel concentration, and geographic reach) and intangible assets (such as strong and respected brands and manager reputations derived from successful track records of investment performance), which can provide them with a degree of differentiation from their peers. While the barriers to entry are not significant for the industry, the barriers to success are extremely highas it takes time and skill to not only put together a long enough track record of investment performance to start gathering assets but to build the scale necessary to be competitive. This has meant that the larger, more established asset managers have tended to have an advantage over smaller players, especially when it comes to gaining cost-effective access to distribution platforms. Competition for investor inflows can be stiff and has traditionally centered on investment performance, especially in the retail channel. Although institutional investors and retail gatekeepers are exerting pressure on pricing, competition based on price has been rare, aside from what we've seen in the U.S. market for exchange-traded funds. While compensation remains the single largest expense for most asset managers, supplier power has been manageable, as many firms have reduced their reliance on star managers and have tied manager and analyst pay to both portfolio and overall firm performance. Asset stickiness (the degree to which assets remain with a manager over time) tends to be a differentiator between wide-, narrow-, and no-moat firms, as asset managers that have demonstrated an ability to gather and retain AUM during different market cycles have tended to produce more stable levels of profitability, with returns exceeding their cost of capital for longer periods of time. While the more broadly diversified asset managers are structurally set up to hold on to assets regardless of market conditions, it has been firms with solid product sets across asset classes (built on repeatable investment processes), charging reasonable fees, and with singular corporate cultures dedicated to a common purpose that have done a better job of gathering and retaining assets. Asset managers offering niche products with significantly higher switching costsretirement accounts, funds with lockup periods, and tax-managed strategieshave tended to hold on to assets longer.Federated, in our view, does not have an economic moat. With $715.2 billion in AUM at the end of September 2023, the company has the size and scale necessary to be competitive in the asset-management industry, but it has not always translated into solid organic growth or above-average profitability (with the firm's adjusted operating margins of 27.3% on average during 2018-22 falling below the group average of 30%). Federated is not as diversified as it needs to be, with just 11% of current total AUM derived from equity strategies, 13% from fixed-income funds, 3% from alternatives, and less than 1% from multi-asset portfolios. Money market AUM (which are expected to generate 46% revenue this year) accounted for 73% of Federated managed assets at the end of September 2023. With the fees earned on the company's cash-management operations (estimated to be 15 basis points during 2023) lower than what Federated can earn on its equity (60 basis points), alternatives/multi-asset (66 basis points), and fixed-income (22 basis points) offerings, growth in the money market platform would depress the firm's revenue yield.As scale is an essential attribute for long-term success in the cash-management business, Federated is well positioned with $525.1 billion in money market AUM at the end of September 2023, making it one of the 10 largest managers of U.S. money market funds with around 10% market share. For some perspective, Fidelity ($1.084 trillion in money market AUM), JPMorgan ($611 billion), BlackRock ($504 billion), Vanguard ($460 billion), Schwab ($436 billion), Goldman Sachs ($422 billion), and Federated ($387 billion) were the eight largest providers of retail and institutional money market funds in the U.S. tracked by Morningstar Direct at the end of the third quarter of 2023. While Federated has developed expertise in managing cash for institutions, which typically have stringent requirements for regulatory compliance, relative safety, liquidity, and competitive yields, we don't believe its money market operations confer any sort of competitive advantage for the firm. The biggest competitor for the industry has always been bank deposits, which have the advantage of qualifying for FDIC insurance (with bank-provided money market and other bank deposit accounts covered for up to $250,000) but have at times struggled to be yield competitive.Prime institutional money market funds (which invest primarily in corporate debt) were able to take share from corporate clients from the mid-1990s onward because of their ability to offer a higher yield on cash investments than the treasury departments at most Fortune 500 firms were able to get from their banks or through their own efforts (which added a layer of internal cost to the equation). That advantage was diminished during the decade following the 2008-09 financial crisis, when historically low interest rates required money market fund providers (which had enjoyed the ability to charge management fees of 26-27 basis points on average) to offer fee waivers to offset negative yields on some funds, as the expenses associated with running the funds were higher than the returns generated by their assets. In Federated's case, during 2008-17 fee waivers wiped out $2.2 billion in revenue and more than $600 million in operating income. More recently, the firm lost $420 million in annual revenue and $143 million in operating income in 2021 to fee waivers required in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak after the federal-funds benchmark rate went to 0% to 0.25%. This was problematic for a firm that has relied on the excess cash thrown off by its money market operations to diversify its AUM, by buying up equity and fixed-income shops and funding internally generated product offerings.Compounding the problem for Federated were new rules for prime institutional money market funds (which invest primarily in corporate debt), which U.S. regulators perceived to be riskier than either government funds (which invest in U.S. government and municipal securities) or retail money market funds. These regulations, adopted in July 2014, required providers of prime money market funds to abandon their stable NAV in favor of a floating NAV. It also allowed them to impose liquidity fees of up to 2%, or to temporarily block investors from redeeming shares of prime institutional money market funds when their liquidity falls below certain levels. This led to a collapse of the prime money market fund segment, which at the end of 2013 had $1.486 trillion ($950 billion institutional/$536 billion retail) of AUM, with total money market fund assets standing at $2.717 trillion ($1.780 trillion institutional/$937 billion retail), according to data from the Investment Company Institute. By the end of 2022, though, AUM in prime money market funds was $660 billion ($246 billion institutional/$414 billion retail), even as total money market fund assets had increased to $4.735 trillion ($3.057 trillion institutional/$1.678 trillion retail). For Federated, prime money market funds went from accounting for nearly 50% of the company's total money market AUM to around 35% of late.At this point, we think the money market fund business is basically commodified, with government and retail money market funds offering no real advantage over bank deposits and bank-provided money market accounts. Money market funds are also facing pressure from low-cost ultrashort bond funds and ETFs, which we think will keep the industry from ever seeing the 26-27-basis-point management fees its products generated before the 2008-09 financial crisis. After seeing the fees on money market AUM run by the asset managers in our coverage drop from 15-16 basis points during 2017-19 to 5-7 basis points during 2020-22 due to the negative effect of fee waivers, and then recover to 15-16 basis-points this past year, we see fees eventually trending down closer to a more normalized 12-13 basis points (primarily due to the competition from low-cost ultrashort bond funds and ETFs). This will likely limit the contribution that Federated's cash-management operations can make to ongoing efforts to expand and diversify the business away from money market funds over the long run.While the firm has made strides to expand its equity, fixed-income, multi-asset and alternatives offerings, Federated has traditionally lacked the scale required in these businesses to be truly competitive, or in a worst-case scenario to offset the losses it would experience if there were large outflows from its money market funds (much as there were during 2010-14 when investors who had flooded into money market funds during the 2008-09 financial crisis started re-risking their portfolios). While the 2020 combination with Hermes helped to further diversify Federated's operations, we continue to believe the firm lacks the scale necessary in its equity, fixed-income, and alternative offerings to get preferred placement on retail-advised and institutional platforms, let alone offset the losses it would experience if there were large outflows from its money market funds. Even so, Federated remains committed to expanding its footprint outside of the U.S., as well as within the non-money market asset classes where it already competes, by acquiring investment-management businesses that already have robust distribution platforms in place.Going forward, we expect increased regulation of asset and wealth management globally, ongoing retail distribution channel disruption in developed markets, a continuation of the shift of investor assets from active to passive products, and a greater focus on relative and absolute fund investment performance and management fees to impact the traditional asset managers. There is also the possibility of another major market correction (with stocks falling 10% or more) or bear market (with stocks selling off 20% or more) in the next five years, which would impact Federated's ability to generate outsize returns. With the company potentially struggling to generate excess returns on a consistent basis over the next five to 10 years, even as it acquires asset managers along the way to help offset the fee and margin compression affecting the industry, and with the firm's ROICs remaining much closer to our cost of capital than we feel comfortable with (especially considering the greater standard deviation we've seen around the company's returns the past five years), we think no moat for Federated is appropriate.","Our Uncertainty Rating for Federated is High and considers environmental, social, and governance issues we feel might be material enough to affect our uncertainty rating or fair value estimate. With the firm's cash-management operations expected to account for more than 70% of total AUM and more than 40% of annual revenue in the near term, the company's fortunes will continue to be influenced by the effect that market volatility and changes in interest rates have on investor participation in equity, fixed-income, and money market funds, as well as the fees that Federated can earn on these products. Shifts among asset classes can be problematic, with fees for fixed-income (expected to be 22 basis points during 2023) and money market funds (15 basis points) being much lower than those for generated by equity strategies (60 basis points). On top of that, historically low interest rates have required money market fund providers like Federated to offer fee waivers to offset negative yields on some funds, as the expenses associated with running those funds run higher than the returns generated by their assets. There is some minor concentration risk within Federated's fund operations, with 12%, 5%, and 13% of the firm's total revenue for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, derived from the Federated Hermes Government Obligations Fund, and 7%, 11%, and 9% of total revenue derived from the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Mid Cap Growth strategy. On top of that, 10%, 9%, and 8% of the company's total revenue during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, was derived from services provided to the Federated Hermes Strategic Value Dividend strategy, which includes both funds and separate accounts. The company also runs the risk of material financial impacts from ESG factors due to a medium exposure to risks inherent to the industry, as well as its own operations, compounded by the firm's poorer disclosure and lack of initiatives aimed at managing its ESG issues.","Federated Hermes is controlled by members of the Donahue family. John Donahue helped found the firm and was CEO from 1989 until 1998, serving as chairman until his death in May 2017. His two sonsJ. Christopher Donahue and Thomas R. Donahuehave served as CEO and CFO, respectively, since the firm went public in 1998. Christopher took over the role of chairman after his father's death. Federated has two shares of common stock: Class B, which is publicly traded, and Class A, which is held in a trust controlled by the Donahue family. Given that the Class B shareholders have no voting rights, the Donahues have complete control over not only the operating and investment strategies employed by the firm but the makeup of Federated's board of directors.Our capital allocation rating for Federated is Standard. This rating focuses on the three key areas where we strive to assess management efficacybalance sheet health, investment efficacy, and shareholder distributions. Given that a firm's financial health directly affects its ability to invest in growth opportunities, return cash to shareholders, or even remain a going concern, it is important to pay attention to its balance sheet strength. Asset managers have a high degree of revenue cyclicality and operating leverage (with results tending to be affected by the vagaries of the equity and credit markets) and are generally asset-light. As such, they should not maintain more than low to moderate levels of financial leverage. Federated, in our view, has maintained a sound balance sheet, with $436 million in cash and investments and $350 million in debt on its books at the end of September 2023, with very low debt/total capital and debt/EBITDA historically. Going forward, we expect net debt/adjusted EBITDA (as well as to enterprise value) to remain low. Better cultures and internal investment processes tend to lead to better and more consistent investment performance, organic growth, and relatively little employee turnover for the asset managers. When growth becomes harder to come by, which has become the case for the more traditional asset managers like Federated, we expect firms to take a variety of different actions, including overhauling their leadership or their investment processes, buying a competitor with better performance or greater product, channel, or geographic diversity, or branching out more aggressively into less-exposed strategies. In general, we look positively on firms whose actions have enhanced their economic moats and have the capital and the wherewithal to maintain their leadership positions and tend to look more skeptically on firms that continue to work on repairing serious deficiencies in their structures or that lack the capital and wherewithal to defend their economic moats longer term.In Federated's case, the company has not been shy about using acquisitions, including deals aimed at consolidating money market fund assets and expanding its equity and fixed-income operations, the latter of which management believes is critical for diversifying the company's asset base and revenue away from money market funds. That said, while the fixed-income investment group is centralized and well-organized, the equity side of the business is fragmented and doesn't have a unified approach, which has kept Federated from finding a productive way to combine its home-grown equity efforts with its acquisitions. The company's acquisition activity has also been highly dependent on the cash thrown off by its money market operations, which have been hamstrung at times the past two decades by the need to offer fee waivers to offset negative yields on some of its money market funds (as historically low interest rates left the expenses associated with running these funds higher than the returns they could generate). Even so, we view the company's investment activity as being fair as opposed to poor.On the distribution front, Federated has historically returned capital to shareholders as share repurchases and dividends. During the past 10 calendar years, the firm repurchased (on a net basis) $778 million of common stock and paid out $1.2 billion as dividends (including the payment of special dividends during 2016 and 2020). While Federated's current payout ratio of around 35% is lower than the 40%-50% range of payouts (when excluding special dividends) during the past five to 10 years, we expect to see only low- to mid-single-digit annual increases in the dividend going forward. As for share repurchases, Federated spent $207 million, $240 million, and $68 million buying back 6.5 million, 7.1 million, and 2.9 million shares of class B common stock, respectively, during 2022, 2021, and 2020.","Federated provides asset management services for institutional and individual investors. The company had $715.2 billion in managed assets at the end of September 2023, composed of equity (11%), multi-asset (less than 1%), fixed-income (13%), alternative (3%), and money market (73%) funds. That said, the firm's cash-management operations are expected to generate around 46% of Federated's revenue this year, compared with 31%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, for the firm's equity, fixed-income, and alternatives/multi-asset operations. From a channel perspective, the company's products are distributed via trust banks, wealth managers and retail broker/dealers (63% of AUM), institutional investors (27%), and international clients (10%).","Federated maintains a conservative balance sheet, using debt primarily as a tool for financing acquisitions. The firm entered 2023 with $350 million in long-term debt comprised entirely of a note purchase agreement due March 2032 with a fixed interest rate of 3.29%, leaving it with a debt/total capital ratio of 25%, a debt/EBITDA ratio (by our calculations) of 0.9 times, and interest coverage of more than 300 times. The firm maintains a $350 million revolving credit facility but had no balances outstanding at the end of September 2023. Assuming Federated closes out the current year in line within our expectations, it would enter 2024 with a debt/total capital ratio of 24%, debt/EBITDA at 0.9 times, and interest coverage of more than 30 times.During the decade ended December 2022, the company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow, and spent $281 million on acquisitions (accounting for 12% of the total), $778 million on share repurchases net of issuances (34%), and $1.2 billion on dividends (54%). Future expected uses of cash flow include acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other business reinvestment, and debt repayments. During the second quarter of 2023, the firm increased its quarterly dividend payment 4% to $0.28 per share, its first increase since the company raised its quarterly dividend 8% to $0.27 per share during the second quarter of 2018. We expect management to increase the dividend at a low-single-digit rate annually going forward. While Federated does not target a specific payout ratio for dividends, it does pay special one-time dividends from time to time. As for share repurchases, the company spent $207 million, $240 million, and $68 million buying back 6.5 million, 7.1 million, and 2.9 million shares of class B common stock, respectively, during 2022, 2021, and 2020.",FHI,Financial Services,2784304896.0,NYQ,528819.0,USD,31.59000015258789,True,1,32.84866494571059,34.20728834175925,1
24/11/2023,Fortune Brands Is Well Positioned to Outperform the Repair and Remodel Market,Fortune Brands Innovations Inc,FBIN,3,,Brian Bernard,66.04,USD,23/11/2023,76.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,,No Text Available,"The R&R market is poised for long-term growth, driven by several secular tailwinds, including the aging housing stock and favorable demographics. Fortune Brands has a robust acquisition pipeline, and future acquisitions could help the company achieve stronger sales growth. Fortune Brands' consolidated profitability and ROIC will improve now that it spun off its less competitively advantaged cabinets business.","R&R spending and new-home construction could materially weaken due to challenging housing affordability conditions and elevated economic uncertainty, pressuring Fortune Brands' sales growth and profitability. Future acquisitions could destroy shareholder value as the result of unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, or subsequent acquisition underperformance. Fortune Brands faces formidable competition in each of its segments. Actions taken by competitors could result in lower sales and profitability.",27/10/2023,"Since spinning off from its holding company Fortune Brands Inc. in 2011, Fortune Brands Innovations has achieved solid top-line growth and improved profitability. Its improved financial performance has been the result of a successful operating strategy overlaying a backdrop of strengthening new home construction and repair and remodel, or R&R, spending.  Residential construction was a bright spot during pandemic-affected 2020-21, and housing starts should remain elevated at about 1.555 million units in 2022. However, deteriorating affordability has slowed housing demand, and we project starts to decrease 10% in 2023 to 1.395 million units. However, we expect improving affordability (due to both lower mortgage rates and home prices) will cause new housing demand to begin to rebound in earnest by 2025. We project starts will reach 1.55 million units by 2026 and average around 1.45 million units toward the end of the decade. R&R spending surged during the pandemic, but we do not expect a dramatic downturn in home improvement projects, although we think the amount spent per project will moderate over the near term. Historically, project incidence has been relatively stable, but average project expenditure is more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. We now expect owner-occupied improvement spending will decrease about 4.5% in 2023 amid a weakening housing market and a challenging prior-year comparison. Nevertheless, we continue to see a 5% long-term growth trajectory for R&R spending. Fortune Brands made meaningful changes to its product portfolio in 2022-23 with the spinoff of its $3 billion cabinets business (MasterBrand) in December 2022 and the acquisition of several security-related brands from wide-moat-rated Assa Abloy in June 2023. We believe these transactions will bolster Fortune Brands' profit margins.","We assign Fortune Brands a narrow moat rating, supported by brand-intangible assets. In our view, the Moen brand underpins a wide-moat rating for the water innovations segment, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of consolidated profits. However, two factors keep us from awarding Fortune Brands a wide economic moat rating. First, we believe the product portfolio within outdoors & security (roughly 35% of consolidated profits) dilutes Fortune Brands aggregate moat due to its lack of product differentiation and pricing power. Second, Fortune Brands acquisitive growth strategy has weighed on ROICs. Since its inception as a public company in 2011, the firm has completed 12 acquisitions and has diversified into a new product category (composite decking). In our view, management has allocated significant capital to no-moat businesses. For example, the firm spent over $1.1 billion in aggregate to acquire Fiberon (composite decking) and Larson (screen doors and windows). We believe that acquisitions will continue to play a prominent role in Fortune Brands capital allocation policy. Fortune Brands Moen brand has leading market share in plumbing fixtures, such as kitchen and bath faucets, and serves various end users including do-it-yourself homeowners, professional remodelers, and homebuilders via retail, wholesale, and industrial distributor sales channels. The plumbing fixture market is largely dominated by three brands  Moen, Delta (Masco), and Kohler (private company)  all of which have greater market share than competing domestic brands, imports, and private label products in North America. Relative to competitors, Moen generally manufactures mid- to high-end faucets and shower heads with higher selling prices than lower-tier brands. Moens prices are comparable to Delta (Masco), another seller of mid- to high-end products, but are below those of luxury suppliers Kohler and Grohe. Various other brands also compete with Moen such as American Standard (owned by Lixil), Pfister (owned by Spectrum Brands), and private labels such as Glacier Bay (Home Depot) and Tuscany (Menards).When purchasing faucets and shower heads for residential use, we believe meaningful consideration is placed upon product quality, functionality, and aesthetics. Moen has solidified its reputation over several decades with respect to each category, leading to widespread adoption of the brand among consumers, general contractors, and homebuilders. We believe Moens strong brand equity has translated into durable pricing power, supporting favorable segment price/cost and upward-trending segment operating margin.Moen is the exclusive brand for more than half of the top 50 homebuilders with similar share with the next 51-200 builders. Because faucets and showers represent a negligible percentage of total home construction cost yet are very visible to customers, homebuilders are willing to pay up for superior brands. Put another way, we believe installing Moen products is a relatively inexpensive way to improve the overall perception of a quality home. Although cheaper options exist, the potential savings is not nearly enough for homebuilders to risk impairing their reputation and incurring replacement costs on low-quality, malfunctioning hardware.During 2016 and 2017, Fortune Brands expanded its water innovations product lines via the acquisition of various luxury brands. Fortune Brands acquired the Rohl (faucets), Perrin & Rowe (faucets), Riobel (faucets), Shaws (kitchen and bathroom sinks), and Victoria + Albert (freestanding bathtubs and kitchen sinks) brands for an aggregate purchase price of nearly $385 million. The acquired brands are now marketed under Fortune Brands House of Rohl luxury offerings. While Fortune Brands acquisitions have provided some diversity amongst the water innovations segment, we estimate that the Moen brand continues to comprise at least 80% of segment sales.Fortune Brands outdoors and security segment manufactures and sells entry and storm doors, combination locks and padlocks, composite decking, decorative trims, and millwork. Notable brands include Master Lock, Therma-Tru (doors) and Fiberon (composite decking). The company has divested assets and actively pursued M&A to refine its product offerings within the segment over the last decade, which has increased segment profitability but also invested capital. In aggregate, we believe the outdoors & security segment warrants a no-moat rating. In our view, the segments portfolio carries less brand equity and more fungible products compared with the water innovations segment. Segment ROIC has been volatile and have struggled to consistently exceed the firms WACC. ","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is High because we think the more uncertain operating environment warrants a wider margin of safety for the stock. Our Uncertainty Rating is also informed by a quantitative methodology to help calibrate our fundamentals-based assessments of uncertainty across a broad universe of stocks.The most substantial risk we see is a prolonged downturn in R&R spending and residential construction. R&R spending is more resilient than new construction but still moves in the direction of the broader economy, and a downturn would likely weaken the companys financial performance. Still, we think Fortune Brands has a durable business model as it has consistently generated positive free cash flow, even during the last downturn. Fortune Brands has made several acquisitions to augment its growth over the last few years, and we expect it to continue to make acquisitions over at least the next several years. Although we think the companys acquisition strategy to date has been satisfactory, there is no guarantee that future acquisitions will be as successful. A variety of factors, such as unfavorable deal terms, integration issues, and subsequent acquisition underperformance, could destroy shareholder value.About 15% of Fortune Brands' revenue is derived in foreign countries, mainly Canada, China, and Mexico. Although we think the companys international presence provides new growth opportunities, diversifies revenue, and damps cyclicality, it also exposes the company to foreign currency, economic, operational, and political risks.","We assign Fortune Brands a Standard capital allocation rating. This rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, satisfactory investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions.We assess Fortune Brands as having a sound balance sheet. The firm operates with a reasonable amount of leverage, and its free cash flow can easily service its debt obligations.We assess Fortune Brands' investment strategy as satisfactory. We believe Fortune Brands' organic investment spend is appropriate and supports its competitive position, and we think its acquisition track record has been satisfactory. Notable acquisitions include, WoodCrafters, SentrySafe, Norcraft, Riobel, Rohl, Shaws, Victoria + Albert, Fiberon, and Larson. Fortune Brands has pruned its product portfolio too, selling its windows business (Simonton) in 2014, its tool storage business (Waterloo) in 2015 and spinning off its cabinets business in 2022. In our view, these divestitures have reduced the company's cyclicality and bolstered profit margin. Because Fortune Brands is an acquisitive company, we like that management's annual incentive awards are partially tied to return on invested capital and working capital efficiency. We think these measures better align managements and shareholders interests as the company focuses on profitable and prudent growth as opposed to growth at any cost. We expect the company to continue to make acquisitions with a focus on assets that can complement and expand its segments. Since its spinoff, Fortune Brands has acquired companies at a measured pace and has not overextended its balance sheet. The executive team is very experienced when it comes to deal making, and we expect its disciplined acquisition strategy will continue.We believe Fortune Brands' shareholder distribution policy is appropriate. In the years following the 2011 spinoff, the company instituted a quarterly dividend and repurchased over 55 million shares. Given the companys dependable free cash flow generation, we expect Fortune Brands will continue to increase its dividend over time. We also expect the company to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares, which we think is appropriate when shares are trading below their intrinsic value. Former COO Nick Fink replaced now retired CEO Chris Klein in early 2020. Fink joined Fortune Brands in 2015 and was named the president of the global plumbing group in 2016. Fink was promoted to COO in early 2019. In late January 2023, Fortune Brands announced that CFO Patrick Hallinan will leave the firm to become Stanley Black & Decker's CFO. Dave Barry, previously Fortune Brands' senior vice president of finance and investor relations, became the firm's finance chief effective March 2, 2023. Barry has been employed at Fortune Brands since 2015, working in various finance roles, such senior director of financial planning and analysis and CFO of the water segment (2017-21). We don't expect Fortune Brands' growth and capital allocation strategies, as articulated at its December 2022 investor day, will materially change under Barry's leadership.","Fortune Brands Innovations is a leading home and security products company that operates two segments. The companys $2.6 billion plumbing segment, led by the Moen brand, sells faucets, showers, and other plumbing fixtures, and the $2.2 billion outdoors and security segment sells entry doors under the Therma-Tru brand name, Fiberon-branded patio decking, and locks and other security devices under the Master Lock and SentrySafe brand names. ","Fortune Brands has a sound balance sheet, and we believe its consistent free cash flow generation will support its debt-service requirements and future capital allocation outlays. As of third-quarter 2023, Fortune Brands had approximately $2.8 billion of outstanding debt and $450 million of cash, which equates to a net debt/2023 estimated EBITDA ratio of about 2.6. We expect Fortune Brands' net leverage ratio will decline to around 2.0 over the next five years.Fortune Brands' debt balance consists of $500 million of 4% 10-year senior notes due in June 2025, $700 million of 3.25% 10-year senior notes due in September 2029, $450 million of 4.00% 10-year senior notes due in March 2032, $600 million of 5.875% 10-year senior notes due in June 2033, and $450 million of 4.50% 30-year senior notes due in March 2052.Fiscal 2006 is the first year stand-alone cash flow statement data available for Fortune Brands Home & Security, and 2022 marked the 17th consecutive year the company has generated positive free cash flow. Since 2009, the company has posted an average free cash flow conversion rate of over 100% and a 7% average free cash flow/sales ratio.

We believe that this will likely become a long-term driver for companies that provide data-driven studies to facilitate research and drug promotion, such as Medlive and Yidu, as they provide doctors a legitimate medium for them to prescribe medicines that could otherwise be perceived as taking kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies. We believe that the anticorruption movement is likely a positive for the long-term clinical development of drugs and this should provide transparency for hospital policies. As for healthcare e-commerce companies such as JD Health and Alibaba Health, we believe the initiative is likely to have less of an impact on their revenue growth in the long term, as they rely on greater healthcare retail demand. However, we think the policies could provide greater consumer confidence for online retailand we estimate penetration of healthcare e-commerce is low at 5%-10% in China. Even so, we believe that in the short term, there could be demand headwinds. We expect a moratorium on medical associations and healthcare conferences conducting large-scale activitiesgiven that scrutiny is likely high right nowand hospital officials are likely cautious about perceived actions that would put them at risk. Of the companies under our coverage, we believe that Medlive should benefit the most given that the platform services 80% of Chinas 4.4 million doctors and can benefit from a known, successful blueprint from its partnership with M3. The latter owns 36.91% of Medlive and has a leading market share in Japan, which follows similar healthcare marketing laws as those in China, where pharmaceutical companies can only advertise their products to doctors and hospitals. ","Healthcare spending looks set to increase to 10% of total expenditure in by 2025, which could lead to increased purchases. Healthcare is underdeveloped compared with other pillars of growth in China, and infrastructure has been encouraged through China's ""Internet + Healthcare"" campaign. Wider acceptance or encouragement from the government leads to more rapid adoption of online healthcare platforms.","There are still concerns from consumers over safety, and using products from healthcare e-commerce platforms is still viewed as a risk. As with many profitable platforms in China, competition intensifies and new entrants squeeze long-term margins, which is common, agnostic of industry. There are new draft guidelines of additional rules as to third-party selling of drugs. There are potential risks for AliHealths growth if industry regulation is tightened.",03/10/2023,"We expect narrow-moat Alibaba Health, or AliHealth, to benefit from low saturation in healthcare e-commerce, leading to 30% year-on-year revenue growth for the next two years. The business is still in the early phase where it is focused on mass user adoption and should see robust growth in the near term. Reaching its break-even goal for operating margins will also highly depend on AliHealth's sales and marketing expenses in the near term. Sales and marketing expense jumped 93% year on year in fiscal first-half 2022 to increase volume on its platform to ward off increasing competition. The company offered subsidies to attract more customers as part of its strategy, and although it indicated that it will significantly lower sales and marketing expenses in the near term, we wait to see whether there are material differences in spending that signal a path toward break-even. We also expect limits to margin upside for AliHealth as the company expects more sales to come from its 1P platform. E-commerce in AliHealth is split between two parts, 1Pwhere it operates its own retailand 3P, where the platform acts as a B2C marketplace like Tmall. We estimate 1P gross margins to be 17.5% and 3P margins to be 45%, which imply a gradual decline in gross margin in the long term as it shifts toward 1P.  Despite offering online consultations, we expect the e-commerce segment to remain the main focus for AliHealth as management indicated that the consultations piece will be complementary to the overall company. However, we expect this to still be a part of its ecosystem that further enhances the appeal of healthcare e-commerce.","We assign a narrow moat rating for Alibaba Health due to its network effect from the number of healthcare merchants, pharmacies, and online doctors on its platform, and intangible assets that come from parent Alibabas user base. AliHealths third-party platform has over 25,000 merchants (and 10,000 merchants for its self-operated store), which should provide plenty of options and variety for its customers. Consumers can receive the similar user experience for Alibaba Health where the user is provided with as wide a selection and convenience as Tmall or Taobao. AliHealth is also privileged to take advantage of existing logistics capabilities from Alibaba, which include courier Cainiao, Freshippos supermarket outlets, and food delivery service Ele.me that can each distribute products to the end user. In addition, on its online consultation platform, there are 140,000 doctors and medical professionals that also provide online consultations for patients. As for its intangible assets, AliHealth can leverage the user base from Tmall and Taobao as traffic acquisition channels, and thus may have competitive advantages with lower traffic acquisition costs compared with other competitors that operate without a parent e-commerce platform.AliHealths 280 million AAB and 25,000 merchants on its platform should provide a large marketplace that satisfies supply and demand and creates a network for consumers and sellers alike. AliHealth, as a niche healthcare online retailer, should help to consolidate fragmentation in the industry as it offers a greater variety similar to general e-commerce platforms. The platform offers both over the counter, or OTC, and prescription drugsand while OTC purchases generally do not have requirements, prescription drugs require the diagnosis from real-life doctors in order to be dispensed online. Chinese law requires authentication of doctors in their online consultations as well as a licensed pharmacist to operate online pharmacies. AliHealth currently has 140,000 in-house medical professionals (including doctors and pharmacists) and 123 online pharmacies, and other entrants wishing to enter healthcare e-commerce would have to also duplicate the network required to run such a platform. The company also partners with different insurance companies. Although patients are not obligated to use AliHealth as their pharmacy, AliHealths in-house pharmacists and doctors can ensure that the correct medicine is dispensed. In turn, the 280 million AAB on its platform are likely to incentivize more insurance companies to work with AliHealth.The intangible assets for AliHealth stem from the existing user base currently on Tmall, which should drive user adoption for AliHealth. Both AliHealths third-party B2C platform (3P) and direct-to-consumer (1P) businesses can be accessed through either its website or through the Tmall app. Users that look for healthcare products on Tmall are then redirected toward the AliHealth flagship shop on the platform where the user can see a menu of different products clustered within the section. Essentially, Tmalls app serves as a channel for AliHealth where users can buy healthcare products. The amount of overlap between Tmall and AliHealth at the moment is still modest, as there are currently 90 million active annual buyers on AliHealths 1P platform compared with 863 million on Tmall (including Taobao). In addition, Alipay users can also access AliHealth retail in its menu as well. While we do not expect complete overlap due to difference in demographics, users should increase steadily as total AliHealth GMV accounts for only about 4% of Tmall GMV currently. Comparatively, Amazon pharmaceutical sales (including generic retail and OTC drugs) accounted for about 30% of total sales in 2020, according to eMarketer.We estimate that AliHealth boasts about 45% market share for healthcare e-commerce in terms of GMV at CNY 136 billion, and about 2.5 times the GMV of rival JD Health, implying 20% share. Given AliHealths dominant market share and user base over its competitors, we expect greater user adoption to drive robust near-term growth as saturation in healthcare e-commerce remains low compared with the entire retail sector. OTC and prescription drugs account for 64% of sales for its 1P business and according to management, current e-commerce penetration for OTC and prescription drugs are 7.5% and 1.5% in China, respectively. Comparatively in the U.S., one in five prescriptions are through mail order. While it is unclear whether mail order necessitates e-commerce, the delivery method represents drug ordering/pickup without going to the pharmacy, which should be parallel with e-commerce delivery for prescription drugs. We believe this implies ample runway for not only AliHealth, but the entire healthcare e-commerce industry where more drugs and medicine will be delivered. With robust growth driven by more active annual buyers, or AAB, we believe this further entrenches AliHealths market share and increases its network effect. While AliHealth enjoys network effect and intangible assets from its parent, its moat is more effective and disruptive toward offline retailers relative to other online giants. There are other online competitors in the industry that are capable substitutes. JD Health, with over 20% market share, also provides logistics services and offers prescription drugs and retail services like AliHealth. JD Health also has over 14,000 merchants on the platforms as well as in-house doctors to verify prescriptions, which should be adequate to provide users with different options. In addition, Ping An Good Doctor and Meituan make up about 3%and 7% market share, respectively. While they are smaller peers in the industry, both have network effects and some logistical capability to become a threat to AliHealth. For example, Meituan employs 1.2 million riders on average daily to deliver nonfood goods and Ping An can piggyback off its parent insurance company and its massive network of pharmacists, which also provides customers with plenty of merchant options. Similarly, AliHealths competitors also have traffic acquisition strategies using larger channels. JD Health has 109 million users and its parent, JD.com has 552 million AAB, where it employs a similar traffic acquisition strategy as Tmall. For other competitors, Ping An Good Doctor also has over 400 million usersand while the platforms main focus is online consultations, bookings, and patient health rather than e-commerceit has the network effect and user base from the parent insurance company to migrate users toward its e-commerce section. Meituan has 667 monthly active users, or MAUs, for its food delivery business that it can funnel toward its nonfood delivery. Therefore, despite a dominant network effect and user base intangibles, we assign AliHealth only a narrow moat rating, given intensifying competition and lack of differentiation in user experience and end-product. Given that the same products can be bought on different platforms, there is a lack of switching costs for AliHealth, which forces competitors to shift toward a low-cost strategy that requires sales and marketing costs to maintain. Signs of increasing competition are already showing as sales and marketing costs for AliHealth increased 93% year on year in fiscal first-half 2022, where operating margin declined to negative 6.3% despite turning 3% positive one year prior. Price wars in China e-commerce are not new as we have seen similarly with Meituan and Pinduoduo spending in food delivery and bulk buying industries. They incurred 3-5 years of heavy cash burn to achieve dominant market share, but total return on investment, or ROI, remains minimal at this point. The long-term results from heavy spending remain unclear given that both companies just achieved break-even in those respective businesses, but we believe upside margins are rather limited as lack of product differentiation will be vulnerable to competitive threats employing the same low-cost strategy. Management already indicated that increased sales and marketing expenses were due to marketing campaigns in order to gain mindshare and volume on the platform. Although AliHealth plans to rein in spending in fiscal year 2023, we believe it remains vulnerable to heavy spending from competitors, which reflects AliHealths limited margin upside.","Our Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating reflects the volatility of China's healthcare industry as it is still relatively nascent compared with the other sectors. The risk for Alibaba Health is that the company is highly leveraged to healthcare e-commerce, and it remains operating margin negative as it continues to ramp up adoption. The risk reflects challenges that Alibaba Health may face to break even and ramp up.Aside from the business risks, there could be greater regulatory risk over medical transactions. In November 2021, Chinas National Health Commission required online hospitals or consultations to authenticate their doctors real identity before providing services, and AI software or technology are not allowed. In addition, the law also stipulates that internet platforms cannot use consultations to leverage the sale of prescription drugs, and doctors cannot designate locations to purchase their prescribed medicine.Another law passed in September 2018 mandated that patients seeking medical treatment need to receive a diagnosis from a nononline doctor first before they can go to an online service. The in-person doctor must read a patients medical records before the patient can use an online service. The law also required medical consultants to have at least three years of clinical experience to provide online consultations, and that only prescriptions for common illnesses and chronic diseases can be given.While these laws should improve the quality of online hospitals and platforms, weed out smaller online pharmacies, and strengthen AliHealths market shares. However, given the early nature of the internet healthcare industry, we believe that it could be vulnerable to policy risksand headline risks such as accidental overdose or wrongful diagnosis in the industry could cause a regulatory overhaul.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for AliHealth is Standard. AliHealth has operated as an e-commerce company for only a little over three years, and while it has made judicious use of capital so far and is well-capitalized, the main concern is that the company will engage in a prolonged bidding war for customer mindshare and volume, resulting in aggressive cash burn. The companys sales and marketing expenses increased 67% year on year in fiscal-year 2022 but is set to slow down its spending in fiscal 2023. We have seen other e-commerce platforms undergo the same type of aggressive spending that has become value destructive where operating margins remain negative or minimal. Should there be long-term margin pressure, there would be downward revisions to our estimates. Poor capital allocation is also mitigated through the use of contracts with other Alibaba subsidiaries. As Alibaba Group remains the parent of AliHealth, other Alibaba subsidiaries can partner with AliHealth where it can specify spending fees, which limits logistics or other operating expenses. For example, AliHealth has agreements with Cainiao, Alipay, Alibaba Cloud, and technical services from Tmall that specified payments. Therefore, AliHealth does not need to bear the entire capital expenditure costs for certain functions and is able to outsource them to other Alibaba subsidiaries. While this may not be in the best interest of other subsidiaries, it is a privilege that AliHealth can afford given its relationship with its parent.The company has made investments as a minority owner in multiple smaller companies that support the overall company. Most of these companies involve IT, platform development functions, or pharmaceutical retail. None are major purchases and the total carried goodwill is CNY 1.3 billion relative to cash and cash equivalents of CNY 11.1 billion. We do not see any signs of bad acquisitions so far in the short history of AliHealth. ","Alibaba Health is China's one of two major e-commerce platform specializing in healthcare-related products, including prescription drugs, OTC drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, health foods, and so on. The company operates both a third-party B2C service, or 3P, and its own direct-to-consumer business, or 1P, with its own inventory, which can both be accessed by Alibabas Tmall app and Alipay. The company also provides online consultation services in a separate app called Yilu or Dr. Deer, although its e-commerce businesses remain its core competency in the long-term. E-commerce accounted for 97% of revenue in fiscal year 2022. We estimate that AliHealth holds about 45% of market share in the industry in terms of GMV. AliHealth is 63.74% owned by its parent company, Alibaba Group.","We do not observe AliHealth to be in any financial distress. It has CNY 85 million of debt on its balance sheet as of fiscal-end 2022, which is very little relative to the CNY 11.1 billion of cash and equivalents. The company appears to be well capitalized as it issued new shares worth CNY 10 billion in August 2020. The main concern for AliHealths financials is the sharp increases in days payable, causing accounts payable to balloon. Days payable have increased steadily to 103 days this fiscal half from 66 days in fiscal year 2018 as the company has ramped up its e-commerce business, likely due to transactions that involve the purchase of goods on its 1P platform where it acts as a retailer. Current accounts payable of CNY 4.2 billion eclipse total accounts receivable and inventory of CNY 2.3 billion, leading to negative working capital. This could cause a concern for lending, but we believe that AliHealth has ample cash currently to mitigate any credit risks. We do not expect working capital concerns to linger long-term.",0241.HK,Healthcare,58599186432.0,HKG,36483031.0,HKD,4.699999809265137,True,1,4.812891569483132,3.650493839640741,0
25/11/2023,Keppel DC REIT Continues to Benefit From Strong Data Center Demand From Emerging Technology Trends,Keppel DC REIT,AJBU,3,16/10/2023,Xinfu Lee,1.9,SGD,24/11/2023,1.92,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,16/10/2023,"We retained our fair value estimate of SGD 1.92 per unit after Keppel DC REIT, or KDC REIT, delivered an in-line set of operating performance data in its third-quarter 2023 business update. Distribution per unit, or DPU, for the quarter fell 3.6% year on year to SGD 0.02492 from SGD 0.02585 due to higher finance cost from refinanced loans and floating interest rate loans, even as contributions from acquisitions and positive rental reversions drove revenue and net property income higher. While the trusts portfolio occupancy rate declined slightly by 0.2 percentage points to end the third quarter of 2023 at 98.3%, management is not worried as it believes that this a transitional vacancy that should recover in the near future. We fine-tuned our operating assumptions and expect no further acquisitions for the rest of 2023 given the lack of deal activity under the high interest rate environment. As a result, our DPU assumptions for 2023, 2024, and 2025 are lowered by 0.7%, 0.9%, and 0.8%, respectively. Based on the last closing price of SGD 2.01 per unit, we think the trust is fairly valued as it trades at a 2024 dividend yield of 5.2%. Although we see KDC REIT as a strong beneficiary of the latest technological trends, such as generative artificial intelligence, we think the positives have been priced in. The trusts new CEO remains upbeat on the prospect of the data center industry, citing data from third-party research reports that suggests global colocation data center demand will outstrip supply in the near term. Notably, he also shared his observations that hyperscaler demand for data centers in China remains strong in the tier 1 cities, amid positive news of the Chinese government granting its first batch of approvals for generative artificial intelligence to companies such as Baidu and Sensetime.","KDC REIT has a strong and reputable sponsor with a healthy pipeline of data center assets for acquisition. The trusts long and well-spread lease expiry profile would underpin stable rental income throughout business cycles. Ongoing digitalization, cloud deployment, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and other technological advancements are expected to drive strong demand for data centers globally.","With around 80% of its rental income contributed by its top 10 tenants, KDC REIT is exposed to high tenant concentration risk.
 KDCs data center equipment may become obsolete quickly due to technological advancement in the industry, resulting in a shorter equipment replacement lifecycle and higher-than-expected capital expenditure. The trusts Singapore properties, that make up more than half of its portfolio, have short leasehold tenures averaging less than 30 years. This may cap any potential capital appreciation of these properties.",16/10/2023,"Keppel DC REIT, or KDC REIT, is a real estate investment trust that principally invests in income producing real estate assets used primarily for data center purposes and assets necessary to support the digital economy. As a wholesale data center provider, KDC REIT leases out its properties as either a colocation, fully fitted or shell and core data center. Among these three, colocation leases make up the majority of KDC REITs rental income but have the shortest weighted average lease expiry, or WALE, profile of less than three years compared with the fully fitted and shell and core data centers that enjoy long WALE profiles of around 12 and eight years respectively (as of June 30, 2023).  Since IPO, the manager has grown the trusts assets under management and distribution per unit by using a mixture of active lease management, asset enhancement initiatives, or AEIs, and acquisitions. Through active lease management, the trust has maintained high occupancy rates and tenant retention rates. It also has a good track record of pursuing AEIs to unlock value within its assets. Notably, it increased the net lettable area of Keppel DC Dublin 2 by 9.7% in 2021 to meet expansion requirements of a tenant. In addition, the trust occasionally participates in riskier development projects with higher payoffs such as the recently completed Intellicentre Campus that has been leased out to Macquarie as a shell and core data center for 20 years. On the acquisition front, the trust has scaled up rapidly, adding at least 1 or 2 assets to its portfolio every year. While KDC REIT has constantly tapped the capital markets to raise funding to complete its acquisitions, we note that unitholders have largely benefited from these deals as they were generally yield accretive. Furthermore, KDC REITs sponsor, Keppel Corporation Limited, is a major real estate manager in the world with a pipeline of more than SGD 2 billion of data center assets that can be acquired by the trust in future.  Looking ahead, we expect the trust to leverage on its sponsors pipeline for accretive acquisitions while continuing its current strategy to create value for its unitholders.","We believe Keppel DC REIT, or KDC REIT, has a narrow economic moat derived from switching costs. KDC REITs data centers are protected from competition by virtue of their mission criticality and tenants facing significant business interruption risk and migration costs when relocating to a different data center. These factors, combined with barriers to entry such as limited number of suitable sites, substantial upfront costs to construct, and tenants preference for data center providers with proven track record, enable KDC REIT to enjoy pricing power and high tenant retention rates above 90% since its public listing.Data centers are mission-critical infrastructure supporting the day-to-day business operations of its tenants. Any data center downtime or outage may paralyze a business, and in some cases, result in reputational and monetary damages. Hence, data center customers are very careful in the selection process of identifying the right data center provider, preferring those with a proven reliability and track record. In addition, once a tenant chooses a data center provider, it is highly unlikely that it would churn to a competitor. This is because of the significant monetary cost involved in the purchasing of data center equipment and the need to replicate a similar set of systems and run both of them in parallel during relocation to minimize downtime, getting rid of the old one only when the new system is running smoothly for a few months. According to an estimate by BroadGroup, the typical cost of moving data centers is between USD 3 million and USD 5 million per megawatt and has a lead time of six to 12 months. Besides the migration cost, we think that the risk of downtime leading to business disruption is the sort of high cost of failure that tenants would rather avoid. Thus, we do not believe that tenants will take decisions to move lightly, and we think that they are effectively precluded from price-shopping once in a data center. For tenants who do give up data center spaces, we observe that this is due to company-specific issues rather than to move to a competing data center. An example is the yielding up of space by a tenant in KDC REITs Malaysia data center in 2017, as it found that it was underutilizing the space leased from KDC REIT. The tenant continues to lease the remaining space and did not shift out to a competing data center. Further, data centers are unlike the general industrial and logistics buildings that are a highly commoditized real estate asset class to develop and can be easily replicable by competitors or even tenants. Data centers require specialized knowledge and intricate understanding of the industry and customer requirements in order to construct and meet the high technical specifications of data center users. These include, and are not limited to, having multiple redundant power and cooling systems to provide the necessary back-up and resilience required by data center users with mission-critical operations such as financial institutions. These equipment and systems are also expensive, resulting in the need for substantial upfront capital to develop a data center. JLL estimates that the cost of mechanical and electrical systems, or M&E, contribute 60% of the data center development while building and land contribute 30% and 10%, respectively. Selecting the right sites to build a data center is also more challenging than other real estate asset classes as there are additional factors to consider, such as access to a sufficient supply of high voltage electrical power and proximity to international network routes. Locations that meet the requirements are in high demand and costly to procure. While the reasons described above do not stop and prevent other traditional developers from building competing data centers, we think that they are limited to built-to-suit projects where they partner with certain larger data center users to develop a high-specification powered shell or fully fitted building and subsequently lease it out to them on a five- to 10-year lease. In our view, this business is less moaty despite its longer lease term than the colocation lease of three to five years, as these users may possess the technical know-how to operate their own data center and have the financial capability to acquire and move into a self-owned data center when the lease expires. Although the high migration cost and business interruption risks still apply, we think that users whose core business revolves around data centers (such as hyperscalers that provide cloud computing services) may see additional benefits, such as improved operating margins that offset the one-time inconvenience of relocating to a self-owned data center. We do not expect this to be a major issue for KDC REIT as its data centers that are leased out on a shell and core and fully fitted basis only make up less than 30% of its rental income. On top of that, the WALE of its fully fitted leases that make up 20% of its rental income is more than 10 years, which we think is a sufficient hurdle to prevent tenants from breaking its lease obligations. In the worst-case scenario where such tenants choose not to renew their leases at the end of the lease term, we see the trust having the ability to step in, convert and operate it as the more moaty colocation data centers. For switching costs to take effect, data centers would need to have acquired customers first, which they can then lock in for the future. Hence, data center landlords with a lot of vacant space to fill may not enjoy the benefits of switching costs, especially during the times where market demand and supply conditions are unfavorable. In markets such as Kuala Lumpur where data center vacancy rates exceed 30%, potential tenants have more bargaining power to negotiate better rates that they can lock in for the next three to five years. On this note, we are less concerned for KDC REIT as its key markets, Singapore and Dublin  collectively contributing 70% of its gross revenue  have data center vacancy rates below 5%. KDC REIT also has one asset in Cyberjaya, Malaysia (south of Kuala Lumpur), which has struggled to raise its occupancy above 65% since its tenant yielded up space in 2017 due to the oversupply situation. However, we think that the impact is limited as we estimate that it contributes less than 1% of KDC REITs revenue and makes up less than 1% of KDC REITs portfolio. As for its expansion plans, we note that KDC REIT tends to grow through acquisition of income producing assets from its sponsor and third parties rather than speculative development (that is, to develop a data center without a committed tenant). In this regard, we see KDC REITs sponsor playing an important role of taking on the development risk and leasing risk before injecting the de-risked asset (stabilized/fully leased) into the REIT. With an existing portfolio occupancy rate of 98.3% and with most of its assets in markets with favorable demand and supply conditions, we think KDC REIT has acquired the customers that could be locked in due to the high switching costs moat. Other data center providers under our coverage have moat sources including network effect. In our view, data center providers derive network effect when they provide services such as interconnectivity and cross-connection solutions that allow tenants to connect with each other directly within a site or across sites globally without having to use the public internet. The advantage of this service is that it would offer tenants superior security and reduced latency. Large scale data center providers with a wide tenant base of blue-chip companies would be more attractive as companies seek to connect with each other securely and at high speeds. However, KDC REIT does not benefit from network effect as it is primarily a wholesale data center provider, focusing on leasing out a large amount of data center space to a relatively small number of tenants and offers limited services to its tenants. We do not expect environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risk to materially impact KDC REITs economic moat. The key ESG issues faced by Singapore REITs in general are higher cost of utilities (water and electricity) and conflicts associated with external REIT management structure. KDC REIT actively manages its energy and water consumption by using renewable energy, where available and feasible, as well as fit-out of low flow sanitary appliances and the use of reclaimed stormwater as part of water recycling efforts. Also, as KDC REIT is an externally managed REIT that is under the control of its sponsor, potential conflict of interest may arise due to misalignment of interest from fee incentives and situations where the sponsor is the counterparty in an asset acquisition or disposal. We think such risks are adequately managed as KDC REIT follows the best practice set out by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS, in the Code on Collective Investment Schemes when dealing with an acquisition or disposal of asset with the sponsor who is an interested party. Linking the performance fee to net property income (set at 3.5% of net property income per year), generally aligns the manager with unitholders by rewarding the manager for good performance in the form of improvements to both rental income and property expenses.","Our Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Keppel DC REIT, or KDC REIT, reflects the trust's exposure to the rising interest rate environment, limiting its ability to replicate its historically successful strategy of growing inorganically. A significant increase in interest rates would increase financing costs and erode distributions to unitholders. However, this is partly mitigated by the trust hedging a large portion of its outstanding debt to fixed interest rates, maintaining a staggered debt maturity profile, and a manageable gearing ratio.One of the key risks faced by the trust is high tenant concentration risk, as the largest tenant contributes about 35% of its rental income, while the top 10 tenants make up almost 80% of its rental income. This could pose a risk if one or more of its top 10 tenants decide to terminate their leases. That said, we think that KDC REIT benefits from a switching costs moat as tenants face significant business interruption risk and migration costs when moving to a different data center. This, together with its staggered lease expiry profile, helps to lower the risk of a significant decline in rents in any single year, particularly during a downturn. In addition, KDC REIT face obsolescence risk of its data center equipment as the industry is characterized by new technologies, evolving industry standards and changing customer demands. Future technological developments may shorten the equipment replacement lifecycle and result in higher-than-expected capital expenditure to meet customers requirements. The trust manages this by withholding some of its distributable income for future capital expenditure requirements. We believe that KDC REITs ESG risks are low and immaterial to the company. We, therefore, do not expect material value destruction from ESG issues to undermine the economic moat.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to KDC REITs capital allocation. In our opinion, the trusts balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We view KDC REITs balance sheet as sound as its gearing ratio of around 36.3% is below the regulatory threshold of 50%. We think it is a manageable level as it leaves ample debt headroom for future acquisitions and asset enhancement initiatives, or AEIs, that can create value for unitholders. With a high occupancy rate of around 98% and weighted average lease expiry of eight years (as of June 30, 2023), we believe KDC REIT has low revenue cyclicality and will display resilience during an economic downturn. We also do not expect the trust to experience any refinancing risk with its healthy gearing and well staggered debt maturity profile. We view KDC REITs investment decisions as fair, as it has historically achieved success in growing net property income and distribution per unit via AEIs and acquisitions. Since IPO, the trust has embarked on a series of AEIs and development projects to expand its net lettable area, increase space utilization and unlock value in its assets. Notably, it increased the net lettable area of Keppel DC Dublin 2 by 9.7% in 2021 and completed the development of Intellicentre Campus that has been leased out to Macquarie as a shell and core data center for 20 years. On the acquisition front, KDC has been actively expanding its portfolio to 21 properties across Asia and Europe, from just eight properties eight years ago. We view this positively, as many of these deals were completed via equity fund raising at a premium and have been yield-accretive to unitholders. Overall, we expect the trust to continue with these approaches in order to create value for its unitholders. The trusts distribution policy is to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to unitholders, in line with the regulatory requirement to enjoy tax exemptions. Historically we note that the trust has paid out around 95% of its distributable income to reward unitholders, retaining a small amount of distributable income for capital expenditure purposes. We think that this is appropriate and expect the trust to continue with this capital return strategy.","Keppel DC REIT is a real estate investment trust that principally invests in real estate assets used primarily for data center purposes and assets necessary to support the digital economy. As of June 30, 2023, it held a SGD 3.7 billion portfolio of 23 properties across nine countries in Asia and Europe. Its properties are leased out as colocation, fully fitted and shell and core data centers. The trust is externally managed by Keppel DC REIT Management Pte. Ltd., and parent company Keppel Corporation Limited owns around a 20% stake in the trust.","We believe Keppel DC REIT is in good financial health. As of June 30, 2023, aggregate leverage is 36.3%, well below the 50% regulatory limit. This also implies that asset values need to fall 27% in order to breach this limit, which we think is highly unlikely. It also has a well staggered debt maturity profile with an average debt tenor of 3.9 years. Interest coverage ratio, or ICR, is also at a healthy 6 times, well above the minimum ICR of 2.5 times required for the regulatory 50% gearing limit (gearing ratio is limited to 45% for REITs with interest coverage ratio below 2.5 times). All-in cost of debt remains low at 3.1%, with fixed-rate debt accounting for around 73% of total debt outstanding.

The trust has also completed refinancing its debt for 2023 and we do not expect the trust to face any problems meeting its SGD 60 million debt obligations in 2024.

24/11/2023,Vinci's Record Order Book and Rapid Recovery in Airport Passengers Provide an Attractive Outlook,Vinci SA,DG,4,27/10/2023,Matthew Donen,109.98,EUR,23/11/2023,122.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,27/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Vinci grew revenue by 9% during the third quarter, supported by the ongoing recovery in passenger numbers across its airports. The defensiveness of its Concessions business, which tends to be resilient to macroeconomic conditions, was supported by impressive organic sales growth at its Energies and Cobra IS segments10.6% and 13.5%, respectively. Management raised its outlook for its Autoroutes business and expects airport passenger numbers in the fourth quarter to be similar to prepandemic levels, which coincides with its upgraded free cash flow guidance of at least EUR 4.5 billion from between EUR 4.0 and EUR 4.5 billion. Shares are trading marginally higher but remain undervalued to our EUR 122 fair value estimate, which we maintain. Passenger numbers across its network of 71 airports grew 21% year over year and are only slightly below the same period during 2019, which supported 38% revenue growth for the airport segment during the third quarter. Its Autoroutes business grew 5%, benefiting from a combination of higher traffic on its toll roads and tariff increases. We believe investor concerns of its cyclical Contracting segment are overstated, reflected by the group's impressive 10% order book growth to a record EUR 63.3 billion, driven by several contract wins related to energy transition. Its order book provides 14 months of visibility and allows Vinci to be selective in bidding for new contracts, which we expect will help protect its profitability should economic conditions deteriorate.","Vincis portfolio of diversified concession assets is a unique opportunity for investors to own irreplaceable infrastructure across multiple assets. Returns are supported by long-term concession contracts with tariffs being contractually tied to inflation. The ongoing recovery in Vinci's airports business will further improve its earnings outlook and balance sheet, allowing room for additional capital returns to shareholders. A healthy order book provides earnings visibility and allows the company to be more selective when bidding on construction projects to protect its profitability.","The financial impact on airlines resulting from COVID-19 may lead to industry consolidation and thus greater bargaining power, which could place pressure on airport fees charged by Vinci. The French government grants Vinci's motorway concessions in the region, which introduces political risk. The government could go against regulatory agreements between the parties for political or economical reasons. Vinci's construction segment, which already earns thin operating margins, may struggle to pass through higher input costs to the customer especially given a weaker economic outlook.",28/07/2023,"Vincis strategy to extend the maturity of its concession portfolio will help the FIRM earn durable excess returns. The group's business models rests on managing and operating critical infrastructure for economies such as motorways and airports, via long-dated concession contracts.  The concessions business is the crown jewel of Vinci's portfolio, earning high profit margins and exhibiting significant barriers to entry. In contrast, the contracting business is less attractive on a stand-alone basis but allows Vinci to draw on its knowledge of critical infrastructure to bid on large projects that require greater know-how and less competition, supporting higher margins. Its expertise is likely a factor behind winning major infrastructure work such as the Grand Paris Express and sections of the U.K.'s High Speed 2 rail line. The combination of the two segments provides low funding costs for the group. Vincis highly profitable acquisition of toll roads from the French government in 2006 has formed the backbone of the firm over the last 15 years. However, subsequent public disapproval of the deal has seen the state become less generous in awarding long-term extensions to Vincis existing network. We expect shorter-term extensions to be awarded given the need to invest in decarbonization of motorways. Mergers and acquisitions have helped Vinci become the largest airport operator, where similar barriers to entry as its autoroutes business exist. The recovery in air passenger growth at Vinci's airports, which remains below precoronavirus levels, will drive growth for the group. Whereas, its record order book allows the group to be selective when choosing projects, ensuring its profitability is protected and offers visibility amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The acquisition of the energy contracting division of ACS will provide Vinci with exposure to the fast-growing renewable energy sector as well as eight concessions mainly in electrical transmission. The development of greenfield projects fits with its expertise and may be the start of the firm committing more capital into the renewables sector with the aim of potentially also operating these long-dated assets.","We assign Vinci a narrow economic moat rating as a result of its concessions business. Vincis extensive network of French toll roads and airport concessions has seen the company carve out an economic moat based on efficient scale and intangible assets. The combination of a dominant market position, strict regulation and lengthy contracts makes it unlikely Vinci should face competition that will erode its returns.Vincis autoroute concessions business (57% of group operating profits) enjoys efficient scale through its dominant position of Frances motorways. The company operates over 4,000 kilometers of the toll-road network in France, which represents close to 50% of conceded French toll roads or 35% of the total motorway network in France via its concession contracts. A competitor would be unlikely to siphon away the 53 billion kilometers of traffic traveled on Vincis network in an economic manner, which would require billions of euros in upfront investments. Even this would unlikely deter the public from using Vincis motorway network, which has managed to see stable traffic even during times of economic volatility, an indication of the importance this route has for daily activity. The need for incremental capacity is most cost-effectively met by incumbent concession holders who can widen and lengthen existing roads. Consequently, the risk of a completely new motorway being built is low. The risk of substitute methods of travel, such as railway, also appears unlikely, with the French transport department forecasting road travel to continue to outperform rail travel over the next 10 years. These factors act as significant barriers to entry, meaning new entrants would unlikely find this market attractive given the high risk and low return payoff profile.Vincis airport segment (21% of group operating profits) operates 72 airports globally, the largest contributors being their 10 airports in Portugal, 11 airports in France and its 2019 acquisition of London Gatwick Airport. We believe the majority of these airports also benefit from efficient scale, with these airports having a stronghold in their respective catchment area. Vincis portfolio of Portuguese airports (34% of airports' revenue) enjoy a monopoly status following the acquisition of a 50-year concession in 2013, which includes five of the six international airports in Portugal. Vinci has recently signed an agreement with the Portuguese government to increase passenger capacity in Lisbon and thus eliminates the possibility of a new airport being constructed and thus divert traffic away from Vinci. We also expect there to be little change to the runway capacity in London, which otherwise could warrant an argument against a narrow moat.Vincis competitive advantage is further supported by intangible assets resulting from: 1) long-dated concession contracts and 2) stringent regulation, which caps and regularly reviews the return concession holders can earn. Vinci holds the right to operate and manage both toll roads and airports globally through concession contracts. The maturity profile of Vincis most material autoroute concessions last up to 2036, whereas its airport concessions have an even longer duration with its Portuguese airports' (34% of airport revenue) contracts ending in 2063. These contracts have historically held up legally when attempts have been made by grantors to withdraw the concession.Both infrastructure asset classes are also subject to strict regulation that limits the return which concession holders can earn. Governments or local authorities are usually the grantors of concessions and tend to be difficult to convince that new infrastructure would be beneficial due to the environmental impact which they have. The 10-year delay, so far, that Heathrow Airport has faced in getting approval to construct an additional runway is the most recent indication of this. While the airports that Vinci operate are relatively regulatory light, the tariffs charged are subject to regular review and can be reset if deemed to be excessive. These regulations, which allow for multidecade operating rights and place a ceiling on returns, act as additional barriers to entry for potential new entrants.We fail to award Vinci a wide moat since three of its motorway concessions, representing 97% of its tolled network, expire between 2034 and 2036 and thus fail to satisfy the required duration for a wide-moat rating. Vincis autoroutes segment is the most profitable within its concessions business and enjoys a 53% operating margin. We also lack sufficient long-term visibility of the runway capacity in London, with Heathrow wanting to increase its flight capacity by more than 50%, which could negatively affect Gatwicks profitability. The thin spread, which Vinci currently earn above its WACC, limits our conviction that the company is able to earn excess returns for a period longer than 20 years, should these concessions not be extended.We rate Vincis contracting segment as a no-moat business. However, we dont feel this segment destroys economic value for the group and thus does not affect our overall moat assessment of Vinci. This decision is based on the limited contribution the segment has on Vincis operating profit and that Vincis concessions business is able utilize this segment's expertise in project management and complex construction to make better informed decisions when bidding for an infrastructure concession.Our no-moat rating for the contracting segment is due to the numerous competitors with similar capabilities, such as Eiffage and Bouygues. Further, low EBIT margins and the divisions large dependence on general economic conditions often results in tenders being awarded primarily on price. This was particularly noticeable during 2015 when Vinci took on loss-making construction projects due to low volumes. These factors limit the segment's ability to consistently deliver excess returns throughout the economic cycle.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Vinci. Vincis portfolio of long-dated concession assets such as toll roads and airports are protected against inflation through contract-linked tariffs and have proven to be highly resilient to macroeconomic shocks. However, its contracting segment is more cyclical and is largely correlated to the macroeconomic environment. Lengthy concession contracts supported by regulation, limit the risk of competition on existing assets. The number of passengers who use Vincis network (traffic risk) is the most important variable. Vincis motorway network has historically shown resilience against macroeconomic turbulence, such as the global financial crisis when Vincis motorway network reported growth in the number of kilometers traveled. Both Vinci's airport and autoroutes businesses have experienced a sharp recovery in passengers once travel restrictions have been lifted, evidence that underlying demand is healthy.Vincis contracting business is subject to greater uncertainty due to its gearing on economic conditions, a competitive bidding environment and thin margins. The segment's record order book of EUR 61.5 billion at first-half 2023 provides 13 months of earnings visibility and allows the group to be selective when bidding for new projects.We view Vinci's environmental, social, and governance risk rating as low. The largest risk is a function of the group performing major construction projects globally where certain regions don't adhere to best practice labor conditions. Vinci help mitigate the risk by contracting an independent organization to audit labor conditions of major sites. On the environmental side, Vinci encourages users to switch to environmentally friendly options on its motorways and airports by investing in better infrastructure.","We assign a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating to Vinci. Our rating is premised on investments that have increased the groups earnings contribution from Vincis concessions business, which enjoy durable competitive advantages and places less importance on the more cyclical and short-cycle contracting segment. A more recurring earnings stream has also allowed Vinci to target an appropriate 50% dividend payout policy and maintain a sound balance sheet. Vincis balance sheet is one of the most conservative among its infrastructure peers.The acquisition of Vincis motorway concession portfolio in 2006 from the French government has been extremely profitable for the group. With the majority of Vincis motorway concessions maturing between 2032 and 2036, Vinci has had to turn to M&As across other infrastructure asset types to extend the maturity of its portfolio. The most transformational deals being the 2013 acquisition of Aeroportos de Portugal, a portfolio of 10 airports, which saw Vinci become an airport operator with scale. More recently, 10 airports have been added to its portfolio since 2018, including the 50% acquisition of Gatwick in 2019 for EUR 3.3 billion, taking its airport tally to 45. While the timing of these acquisitions was unfortunate, given the lack of air traffic due to COVID-19, we believe these acquisitions will be value accretive to shareholders over the long run, and thus warranting a fair rating.We think Vinci paid a fair price for its most sizable airport acquisitions. Low interest rates have meant Vinci has been up against widespread competition, which includes infrastructure funds with high levels of dry powder who are in search of yield. We calculate the multiples paid on the ANA acquisition to be 15 times EV/EBITDA and Gatwick 19 times EV/EBITDA, which appears to be in line with transaction multiples paid on European airports having ranged between 10 and 25 times. The large up-front capital outlay, long duration of the assets and lack of air traffic following COVID-19 travel restrictions have had a negative impact on short-term profitability as measured through Vincis return in invested capital and means a true assessment of these acquisitions can only be made several years from now. The offer for ACS Industrial Services, which we deem as a slightly higher-risk business than Vinci Energies, at a 6.1 times multiple does not affect our overall capital allocation rating. The group can leverage its expertise when developing greenfield projects and this may be the start of the company committing more capital to the renewables sector with the aim of potentially also operating these long-dated assets.","Vinci is one of the worlds largest investors in transport infrastructure. Significant concession assets include 4,400 kilometers of toll roads in France and 72 airports across 13 countries, making Vinci the worlds largest airport operator in terms of managed passenger numbers. The concessions business contributes less than one fifth of group revenue but the majority of operating profit. Vincis contracting business provides a broad variety of engineering and construction services.","Vinci has been able to withstand the worst of global travel restrictions and its balance sheet will continue to benefit from the recovery in air traffic. The group closed fiscal 2022 in a healthy position with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times, which allowed the group to reward investors with a dividend increase of 38%. The defensive nature of the group's concession cash flows allow the group to take out considerable amounts of debt, nevertheless, 41% of the company's debt is at fixed rates, helping it withstand a rising interest-rate environment.We forecast Vinci will generate between EUR 4.7 billion and EUR 5.7 billion of free cash flow during our five-year forecast period, which will see its net debt/EBITDA drop below 1 times by 2025, leaving plenty of room for further capital returns or investments into additional concessions.",DG.PA,Industrials,64600666112.0,PAR,119227.0,EUR,109.72000122070312,True,1,103.22389571968392,115.72337368884699,1
24/11/2023,Packaging Corp Navigates a Difficult Operating Environment Amid Moderating Box Demand,Packaging Corp of America,PKG,1,25/10/2023,Spencer Liberman,155.13,USD,24/11/2023,114.0,Medium,,Standard,A,25/10/2023,"No-moat-rated Packaging Corp of America reported solid operating results during their third quarter as inventory destocking moderated and resulted in better than anticipated shipments relative to the first half of the year. Nonetheless, continued macroeconomic headwinds have resulted in pricing declines, which drove revenue down roughly 9% year over year as packaging and paper both saw declines. While we expect this trend will persist through the end of the year, we are encouraged by the slowdown in inventory destocking and cost savings experienced in the quarter. As such, we've raised our fair value estimate to $114 from $113 per share due to increased near-term profitability in our forecast. The companys packaging segment continued to face macroeconomic pressure in the quarter, with net sales falling 9% year over year and segment operating margins contracting almost 400 basis points to 14.5%, mainly due to lower selling prices. That said, corrugated product shipments per workday were up 1.9% compared with the same period last year and up 3.9% compared with the second quarter of 2023 as inventory destocking appeared to moderate. Destocking has been a pain point for containerboard producers for over a year, and an increase in inventory spending could provide a strong tailwind for growth. Nonetheless, the shift of consumer spending from goods toward services and higher interest rates continue to weigh on demand for both durable and nondurable goods. Packaging Corps paper segment reported a 4.5% decline in sales year over year as a gain in price and mix of 3.5% was more than offset by an 8% drop in volume. This decrease in volume is expected and has followed a years-long trend of declining paper demand in North America, one that we think will persist for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the volume pressure generated from a decline in demand will likely pressure prices as well, and we expect this combination will eventually drop margins to the mid-single digits.","Packaging Corps focus on specialized products and regional customers will enable the firm to continue earning stronger returns than its competitors. Packaging Corp of America, International Paper, and WestRock will remain disciplined in taking economic downtime when needed in order to safeguard prices. After many producers converted their paper assets, Packaging Corp will benefit from its remaining paper business as tight supply enables price growth.","Despite a period of attractive margin expansion in containerboard production, the best days are behind Packaging Corp as new capacity weighs on linerboard prices. Since much of its paper assets have been converted to containerboard production, Packaging Corp is mainly a containerboard business and will see a decrease in revenue and profitability when e-commerce demand normalizes. Demand for paper will continue to fall, which will prevent price growth in its paper business and constrain Packaging Corps consolidated margins.",25/10/2023,"Packaging Corp of America manufactures packaging products and uncoated freesheet, or UFS, paper. It accounts for roughly 10% of the North American containerboard market and is the third-largest producer. The majority of the company's containerboard is used internally to produce corrugated packaging, with the remainder sold to external customers. A decade of consolidation in the corrugated packaging industry allowed Packaging Corp to raise prices aggressively, but increased competitive intensity from legacy paper producers has limited pricing power in recent years. In Packaging Corps largest segment, packaging, the firm manufactures containerboard and corrugated packaging products. A majority of the companys containerboard production is sent to Packaging Corps box plants where it's converted into corrugated packaging. The remainder is sold on the open market to local or regional box manufactures. The firm's corrugated packaging products are used in a variety of end markets, including food and beverage, e-commerce, paper products, and other goods. Corrugated boxes provide a strong yet lightweight packaging option that is cost-effective. This dynamic has made corrugated boxes a favorite in the packaging industry and is used in many different end markets. The companys paper segment produces UFS paper and is one of the largest manufacturers in North America. Packaging Corp was a small paper producer prior to its 2013 acquisition of Boise Inc. that also included additional containerboard capacity. The firm now produces commodity paper and specialty paper, which can include custom features (that is, coatings, colors, and brightness). Packaging Corp sells its paper through retailers and directly to customers, with its partnership with Office Depot accounting for 48% of segment sales in 2022 (4% of consolidated sales). ","We do not think Packaging Corp of America benefits from an economic moat, despite being one of the largest containerboard manufacturers in North America. A majority of Packaging Corps business (92% of 2022 revenue) involves manufacturing containerboard, which is mainly used in corrugated packaging products. Over the last two decades, consolidation has shifted a once fragmented industry into four major players and a handful of smaller firms due to the high capital costs required to efficiently produce containerboard. Almost all of Packaging Corps packaging segment sales are in North America, where the firm accounts for approximately 10% of industry supply. While there are some traces of efficient scale and cost advantage moat sources, we do not think they are substantial enough to award Packaging Corp an economic moat.Packaging Corp is one of the largest producers of containerboard and corrugated packaging in North America. The containerboard industry has gone through a period of consolidation, with four players now controlling approximately 70% of supply. Many incumbents have deep roots in traditional paper but have since pivoted to containerboard as demand for paper declined and corrugated packaging rose. Packaging Corp still operates a paper business, but its production volume and sales have declined for years as paper assets have been converted to containerboard production. Machines used to make paper can be converted to produce containerboard, making it an attractive opportunity for legacy paper producers looking to capitalize on growing demand. Additionally, e-commerce growth has increased regional and global shipping, with many opting to ship with corrugated packaging for its low cost and durability. This dynamic provided a strong incentive for paper companies to convert their aging paper mills to containerboard mills. During the period of consolidation, corrugated packaging companies enjoyed widening margins as prices were increased aggressively. Following this, incumbents and new entrants were quick to increase supply, mainly by converting aging paper mills to containerboard, putting pressure on containerboard prices. While e-commerce provided a tailwind, declining paper consumption and a flat volume outlook for food and beverage (two significant containerboard end markets) diminished upside. Today, the corrugated packaging industry shows elements of a rational oligopoly but continues to face pressure from converted paper mills and threats of substitutes from plastic packaging.We continue to see little contribution from the efficient scale phenomenon toward Packaging Corps economic moat. The consolidated nature of the North American containerboard market, where four companies account for about 70% of supply, combined with the commoditized nature of containerboard make for an industry that could enjoy an efficient scale moat source. That said, the conversion of paper assets has increased capacity and limited containerboard price growth. Lower price growth has constrained margins and hindered Packaging Corp's ability to earn strong returns on its invested capital. While high capital costs usually inhibit new entrants from entering a market with efficient scale, smaller paper producers can join the market with relative ease by converting their paper assets to containerboard production.As one of the largest containerboard producers in North America, Packaging Corp could benefit from a cost advantage moat source, but we see little evidence that would suggest the firm enjoys this competitive advantage. Packaging Corp operates eight packaging and paper mills that are located across the United States. Once the raw materials are processed at its mills, they are transported to one of its 90 converting and packaging plants. Packaging Corp's plants are dispersed throughout North America to minimize the distance between the plants and customers due to the low value/weight ratio of corrugated board. Packaging Corps competitors have comparable mill and plant footprints as they source raw materials in similar areas and require a dense plant network to service customers efficiently. While Packaging Corp is one of the largest producers of containerboard and could benefit from scale, its production is spread across a handful of mills and numerous plants that each have their own fixed cost structures, preventing it from capitalizing on any operating leverage advantage.For commodity producers, their position on the cost curve is significant. Operating as low-cost producer can lead to years of strong economic profits and provide a durable competitive advantage. That said, the low value-to-weight ratio of containerboard forces producers to operate with a regional and even local presence, with each location having its own cost curve and rendering the industrywide cost curve largely irrelevant. Packaging Corps substantial size within the containerboard industry does little to lower its operating and input costs, forcing the firm to compete on price. Without a cost advantage or presence of the efficient scale phenomenon, we do not think that Packaging Corp, being a commodity producer, possesses an economic moat.Packaging Corps paper business produces uncoated fresh sheet, or UFS, paper that is sold to a variety of customers in North America under its Boise Paper brand. UFS paper is primarily used in businesses and schools for printing, writing, and publishing. A majority of the UFS paper produced by Packaging Corp is commoditized and produced in line with industry standards for size, weight, and color. Its commoditized paper competes mainly on price, limiting returns the firm can earn on its paper business. Demand for UFS paper has declined for years as consumers and businesses shifted from printed materials to electronic alternatives. This incentivized Packaging Corp and its competitors to move away from paper, and many opted to convert their paper assets for containerboard production. While the segment has struggled to consistently earn a in profit recent years, we expect slow growth and limited operating profits for Packaging Corps paper business over our forecast. That said, the paper business is not large enough to represent a material impact on our opinion of Packaging Corp.","We assign Packaging Corp a Medium Uncertainty Rating. We continue to view the threat of substitutes, risk of additional capacity, and exposure to economic cycles as the key sources of valuation uncertainty for the company. Following a period of consolidation in the containerboard industry where companies enjoyed widening margins, new entrants have increased industry supply. Notably, legacy paper companies began to convert their paper mills to containerboard production as paper machines in the mills can be converted easily. These conversions increased supply and constricted containerboard price growth, even as raw material and labor costs rose. Additional conversions could put further pressure on prices and weigh on Packaging Corps returns. The firm also faces a threat of substitutes, as some firms (such as Amazon) are actively reducing the use of corrugated packaging. That said, there are only a select number of products that fall into these categories.Packaging Corp is exposed to some environmental, social, and governance risks, including carbon emissions from the firm's operation and sizable water usage for production. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. Packaging Corp operates a large network of containerboard and paper mills as well as converting plants. These mills and plants generate toxic air emissions and effluents. Failure to properly manage these can result in revoked operating permits, temporary closures, or significant fines. Packaging Corp uses a significant amount of fresh water, and some of its sites are in areas that are susceptible to droughts, which could adversely affect Packaging Corps operations. That said, given that there are few viable alternatives to corrugated packaging, we see a low materiality impact to Packaging Corps valuation.","We assign Packaging Corp a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This rating reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We view Packaging Corps balance sheet as sound. We believe the firm's leverage is reasonable considering its stable profitability and strong free cash flow generation. The firm has maintained a net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.0 since 2018 and was 1.1 in 2022. We expect management to remain disciplined going forward with strategic acquisitions that are smaller in size while maintaining reasonable leverage. We see Packaging Corps investments as fair. In recent years, Packaging Corp has shifted its strategy away from paper and concentrated on containerboard production. Paper demand has fallen for over a decade as consumers and businesses moved to electronic alternatives. During this time, containerboard demand soared due to its low cost and durability. Packaging Corps acquisitions have mainly focused on expanding its containerboard portfolio. The firm has also converted paper assets to containerboard production, which provided the firm with cost-effective capacity expansion. Finally, we think distributions are appropriate. Packaging Corp periodically executes share repurchases during strong quarters, but management is committed to returning cash to shareholders through its dividend. We expect this strategy to continue as additional share repurchases will occur during times of strong demand. That said, this strategy doesnt tend to take share price into account, so some repurchases are made at high valuations. We expect the firm to maintain its dividend going forward as Packaging Corp continues to generate solid free cash flow.",Packaging Corp of America is the third-largest containerboard and corrugated packaging manufacturer in the United States. It produces over 4 million tons of containerboard annually. The company's share of the domestic containerboard market is roughly 10%. The firm differentiates itself from larger competitors by focusing on smaller customers and operating with a high degree of flexibility.,"We think Packaging Corp has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt-service requirements and future capital-allocation decisions. Leverage increased following the 2013 acquisition of Boise Inc., but Packaging Corp has since limited any additional debt buildup. Its net debt/adjusted EBITDA was roughly 1.1 in 2022, down from over 3.0 in 2013. Packaging Corp has made several small acquisitions since it acquired Boise Inc., with most focused on expanding its containerboard business to capitalize on growing demand. We think future acquisitions will be small in size as the containerboard industry is highly consolidated. That said, there are many regional producers that would provide an opportunity to expand production capacity. The firm has roughly $2.5 billion in outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2051, but its next maturity isnt until 2024 when roughly $400 million is due. Its solid asset base should provide the firm with ample access to capital markets should it need to raise additional capital for future capital allocation decisions.",PKG,Consumer Cyclical,15210141696.0,NYQ,1000858.0,USD,155.1300048828125,True,0,148.5213689467459,168.50745168546095,1
25/11/2023,Edenred Cruising in 2023,Edenred SE,EDEN,4,19/10/2023,Michael Field,50.44,EUR,23/11/2023,69.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,19/10/2023,"The momentum behind wide-moat Edenred's revenue growth showed no sign of letting up in the third quarter, with like-for-like revenue up almost 24% year over year. Operating revenue growth got a welcome boost from higher interest rates, which generate higher returns on cash on deposit. With the 9-month performance tracking guidance, management made no change to their full-year EBITDA target of EUR 1.055 billion at the midpoint, which represents 26% growth on 2022. With the shares having fallen recently, largely on French antitrust concerns, we see attractive upside to our EUR 69 fair value estimate. After it diversified so much into peripheral areas in recent years, it was ironic that Edenreds core business, benefits and engagement, was again the standout performer over the period with operating revenue up more than 20% on an organic basis. This was driven by the traditional Ticket Restaurant business, which received a huge boost from inflation, with many countries raising the statutory face value of benefits to help retain their purchasing power. Geographically, Latin America and the rest of the world divisions performed well. In the former, a large part of this strong performance was the continued penetration of its fleet and mobility solutions business in the region. In the current macroeconomic environment, with high inflation and rising interest rates, its difficult to find stocks that can withstand the onslaught, let alone thrive. However, Edenred is well positioned as the value of its products and services generally rises in tandem with inflation, and with positive working capital the business also benefits from rising interest rates, driving interest income higher.","Edenred's programs center on providing for basic needs, which insulates the company from economic cycles. Edenred serves small businesses, which have less bargaining power. Two thirds of its corporate clients have fewer than 200 employees. A shift toward electronic vouchers raises the company's costs in the near term because of the need to maintain dual platforms, but over time, the shift to digital should reduce costs and improve margins.",About half of Edenred's volume is generated in France and Brazil. This concentration exposes the company to meaningful risk if tax laws are changed in these countries. Edenred had to instigate the legal framework necessary for its programs in many countries. The need to get governments to adjust laws could delay further expansion. The global trend toward electronic payments and new payment methods could create opportunities for new competitors to challenge Edenreds position in the market.,25/05/2023,"Edenred is the world leader in prepaid corporate services, with its main business in employee benefits, such as meal vouchers. This market is highly concentrated: In key region Brazil, for example, Edenred is the number-one player, followed closely by peers Sodexo and Alelo. Together, the three control 90% of the market. Edenred has a presence in 46 countries and holds the number-one or number-two spot in each of its key markets. Founded in 1962, Edenred has benefited materially from first-mover advantage in the space, establishing a strong network of clients and merchants worldwide, which has contributed to an issue volume compound annual growth rate of more than 8% over the last decade. Although there are thousands of micro players in the industry, achieving scale within this sector is not easy, and dislodging market leaders such as Edenred is a task akin to usurping Visa or Mastercard in the payment space. Edenred has significant exposure to higher-growth emerging-market countries, which generate just close to half of group revenue. Although exposure to countries such as Brazil can bring volatility in terms of currency movements, EBIT margins in regions such as Latin America are the highest across the group, averaging more than 40% over the past decade, partly due to their higher use of digital vouchers. With well over 90% of transactions in digital form, we believe increased progress in the transition from paper vouchers and cards will lead to further cost savings as reductions in printing and distribution activities are realised. We believe that Edenreds record of successfully rolling out its employee benefit programs to new regions is a strong indicator of its ability to continue doing so, with the company adding roughly one new country to the portfolio every year. We also view managements strategy of diversifying into other areas, such as expense management, as broadly positive, given their equivalently attractive margins and the increased size of the market potential in these segments.","We believe that Edenred has a wide moat stemming from network effect. Ticket Restaurant, Edenreds primary business, was created in 1962 and came about through the French governments recognition of meal vouchers as an employee benefit. The purpose of this recognition was to put small companies without canteen facilities on an equal tax footing with larger companies that provided meals to employees in dedicated canteens. Under this system, employers purchase vouchers for their employees, who can then use these vouchers in various eateries. Edenred has since been at the forefront of the meal voucher industry, benefiting from first-mover advantage and establishing strong market positions and networks in key regions such as France and Brazil. Edenred operates only in markets in which it occupies a number-one or number-two position; in France, for example, it has an estimated market share of 40%, more than twice that of number-two player Sodexo. Edenreds fast-growing network now comprises 850,000 corporate clients and 2 million affiliated merchants, culminating in a user base of over 50 million employees worldwide. This vast payment network, in a similar way to that of Visa or Mastercard, acts as a virtuous circle: Each new merchant that signs up with Edenred makes the network more attractive to its users, who desire a greater choice of eateries in which to spend their vouchers. Likewise, for merchants, particularly in countries where the use of meal vouchers is prolific, the larger the network of users and competing eateries, the more likely they will be to sign up or risk losing clientele.Since its listing in 2010, Edenred has generated average EBIT margins of just over 33%, similar to those of payment peer Mastercard. Given the extremely asset-light nature of the business, combined with the positive working-capital situation that arises through meal voucher issuance, Edenred generates returns on invested capital of around 15%, well in excess of its 8.2% cost of capital.","While Edenreds primary source of revenue consists of fees levied on merchants and clients, the company also benefits to some degree from interest income on its cash float. As interest rates, particularly those on relatively short-term deposits, have declined materially over the past few years, so too to some extent has the companys ability to generate revenue from this source. Given market expectations for a ""lower for longer"" interest-rate policy, it may be a considerable time before Edenred can once again benefit materially from this source of revenue.Edenreds exposure to Latin America is also a key risk for investors. Brazil in particular has experienced a prolonged recession, and the high level of competition in the food voucher business has led to discounting on fee income; combined with close to zero issue volume growth, this has led to negative revenue growth for the past three years. If this difficult operating environment were to continue, it could hamper the companys revenue growth ambitions over the coming years. A secondary risk stemming from the companys large exposure to Latin America is that of currency risk. Material devaluation of the Brazilian real has led to a negative impact on revenue growth of almost 10% on average over the past five years. As such, we assign a medium uncertainty rating to Edenred.From an ESG perspective, Edenred flags as low risk, with the only tangible risk being that arising from data privacy issues. Although Edenred handles data for an enormous amount of people, for the most part this data is not of a particularly sensitive nature, thus mitigating the risk to a large degree in our view.","Current CEO Bertrand Dumazy has been in the position since 2015, coming from a relatively unrelated industry, but with a great deal of experience. Given however the unique nature of Edenreds business, this is perfectly understandable. Edenreds board is composed primarily of nonexecutive directors, in line with corporate governance best practice. We would, however, advocate the separation of the CEO and chairman roles, which are currently both held by Dumazy.In terms of the companys strategy, we have seen a shift toward a more diversified business mix over the past few years, away from Ticket Restaurant and into peripheral areas. The company has expedited this shift by making a number of significant acquisitions in the payments solutions and fleet mobility spaces, which together now generate almost 40% of group revenue, up from 30% five years ago. Time will tell whether diversifying away from its core business will pay off; however, given the size of the potential market in areas such as fuel cards, and the attractive margins available, this seems to us like a sensible strategy.As the business mix has shifted, management has altered the way in which it guides to performance, away from issue-volume-based guidance to operating revenue growth. The company has also updated its dividend policy, with management now committing to pay out a minimum of 80% of the net result. We believe this is a prudent development, as it gives the company additional flexibility while still maintaining a healthy return to shareholders. Edenreds acquisitions have been focused on areas outside its traditional employee benefit business, in areas such as expense management. As such, we assign the company a Standard capital allocation rating.","Edenred is a France-listed prepaid corporate services provider operating in 45 countries. The company was listed in 2010 following a spinoff from hotel group Accor. Edenred's main business, Ticket Restaurant, offers prepaid meal vouchers that employers provide to their employees as an additional benefit. The company is also involved in other areas such as prepaid fuel cards and payment and expense-management systems.","Edenreds large cash float, a product of its voucher issuance model, skews traditional metrics such as net debt/EBITDA, which we would normally use to assess the financial health of the company. As much of this cash is limited by legal restrictions and is set aside to cover voucher redemptions, we think it is more prudent to use a measure that ignores cash in our assessment. On a debt/EBITDA basis, Edenred is moderately geared, with a ratio of almost 3.5 times at the end of 2022, down from 5 times in 2021. Given the companys strong cash flow-generating ability, however, we estimate that this ratio will continue to fall to below 2 times by the end of our forecast period. Interest coverage stands at a more than healthy 16 times on an EBITDA basis, indicating that the company can easily meet its debt-service costs.Regulation is the biggest risk to the company's financial health. Any change by regulators, such as that in Brazil a few years ago, to force Edenred to ring-fence cash on its balance sheet to meet voucher redemptions could cause potential issues. In this specific instance, there was no material effect on the profit and loss statement, and the EUR 200 million amount was extremely manageable for Edenred; however, similar changes to regulations in multiple regions could be more onerous for the company.",EDEN.PA,Financial Services,12750042112.0,PAR,45162.0,EUR,50.41999816894531,True,1,55.34390806877817,52.92000005331566,1
24/11/2023,Two New Drug Launches Are Pushing Narrow-Moat BioMarin Further Into Profitability,Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc,BMRN,3,02/11/2023,Karen Andersen,88.42,USD,23/11/2023,96.0,High,Narrow,Standard,A,02/11/2023,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical reported solid third-quarter top-line growth of 15%, relatively in line with our estimates, and were not changing our $96 fair value estimate. We think this puts the firm in a good position to meet our revenue forecast of roughly $2.4 billion for the full year, as ongoing launches of achondroplasia drug Voxzogo and hemophilia A gene therapy Roctavian provide support to the firm's narrow moat. BioMarin also announced that 18-year CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaim will step down at the start of December, but were confident that his replacement, Alexander Hardy (current CEO of Genentech), has the qualifications to lead the firms future growth. Management significantly lowered 2023 guidance for Roctavian from $50 million-$150 million to under $10 million, which is a surprising reduction in magnitude and shows a continuation of launch difficulties over the past year. BioMarin has navigated a lengthy path to reimbursement in Europe this year and successfully treated one patient in the second quarter in Germany at a price of roughly $800,000. A second patient has since been treated, and many patients are awaiting therapy. In the United States, BioMarin has secured solid reimbursement for Roctavian, but hemophilia treatment centers are still preparing to test patients for eligibility and offer treatment. We reduced our sales to fit 2023 guidance and also slowed our assumed sales trajectory for the drug in coming years, although we still see the gene therapy approaching $1 billion annually in the long run. Conversely, Voxzogos launch in achondroplasia continues to progress well, and the recent Food and Drug Administration label expansion to all children (previously ages 5 and up) as well as a similar label expansion in Europe should accelerate uptake, which fits with managements decision to raise 2023 Voxzogo guidance. We raised our forecast to $458 million from $435 million, slightly above the high end of new guidance of $435 million-$455 million.","BioMarin's approved drugs have been granted orphan-drug status in the U.S. and European Union, providing them with at least 7 and 10 years of market exclusivity, respectively. BioMarin's drugs target rare chronic conditions that often require treatment from a very young age, and while locating eligible patients on a global level is challenging, the firm has high patient retention rates. With a growing portfolio in an attractive rare-disease nicheand acceleration of profit growth beginning in 2022BioMarin could be an acquisition target for pharmaceutical firms with pipelines to fill.","Diagnosis of rare genetic diseases can be difficult, and BioMarin could have a hard time locating enough patients to recoup development and manufacturing costs. BioMarin's gene therapy pipeline has witnessed setbacks, including a delay in U.S. approval of hemophilia A gene therapy Roctavian and a clinical hold on PKU gene therapy BMN307 as the FDA investigates potential for cancer risks. Viral contamination forced Genzyme (now Sanofi) to halt manufacturing of its enzyme replacement therapies in 2009, highlighting the manufacturing risk in the industry. ",01/08/2023,"BioMarin is amassing a portfolio of genetic-disease therapeutics, making historical comparisons with Genzyme (acquired by Sanofi) difficult to avoid. Commercialization and research and development expenses have kept BioMarin in the red, but we're confident in the profit-generating power of its rare-disease treatments, and BioMarin's turn to profitability looks maintainable. With a deep in-house pipeline and the ability to supplement growth with strategic acquisitions, BioMarin is in a strong position. BioMarin's life-saving therapies may serve only a few thousand patients globally, but with six-figure price tags on most products and high barriers to entry, we see this as a very attractive marketplace. Genzyme (now Sanofi) and BioMarin formed a 50/50 joint venture to market BioMarin's first drug, Aldurazyme, for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I, or MPS I. BioMarin's MPS VI drug, Naglazyme, is maturing, but still seeing solid growth due to use in emerging markets like Brazil and higher (more expensive) dosing as young patients mature; we think peak sales will surpass $400 million. BioMarin is also well positioned to treat the entire spectrum of patients with phenylketonuria, or PKU, one of the world's most common metabolic disorders. While generic versions of Kuvan (mild to moderate PKU) launched in the U.S. in 2020, more potent drug Palynziq launched in 2018 in the U.S. to serve adult patients with PKU, including patients with more severe disease. PKU is well diagnosed thanks to state-mandated newborn screening programs, and no alternative drug therapies exist. Vimizim in Morquio A syndrome and Brineura in CLN2 disease should also drive growth.  However, the two biggest growth drivers for BioMarin are just launching. Voxzogo (vosoritide) has shown the ability to restore normal growth rates in young patients with the most common form of dwarfism, and recent U.S. and European approvals are driving strong growth. Hemophilia A gene therapy Roctavian launched in 2022 in Europe and is launching in the second half of 2023 in the U.S. We think each could generate peak sales at or above $1 billion.","We think BioMarin's lucrative monopolies in several rare-disease niches have provided it with enough competitive advantages to warrant a narrow moat. We think the firm does face environmental, social, and governance risks, particularly related to potential U.S. drug price-related policy reform. However, less than half of BioMarin's revenue is derived from the U.S. pharmaceutical market, and the firm's rare-disease focus and relatively flat global pricing insulate the firm from these pressures to some extent; therefore, policy reform risk does not affect our valuation or moat rating. Product governance issues (including litigation) also remain a risk, but given BioMarin's focus on life-saving rare-disease therapies, we don't think this risk is meaningful enough to capture in our valuation or moat rating.BioMarin operates in the market for ultra-orphan disease treatments, and already sees substantial sales from three marketed products. Aldurazyme, BioMarin's first product, was approved in 2003. Only 3,000 people in the developed world are afflicted with the life-threatening disease MPS I, but Aldurazyme's $200,000 price tag and market monopoly (thanks to orphan drug exclusivity and difficult manufacturing) have made it a more than $200 million product. For Naglazyme, approved in 2005, although a key patent expired in 2022, we don't see any Naglazyme biosimilars in development. We think Naglazyme will grow to a $500 million product in the long run, and BioMarin retains global rights to this product. While BioMarin's third product, PKU drug Kuvan, is a small molecule, and saw generic entrants in 2020 in the U.S., the firm's newest enzyme replacement therapy Palynziq (for adults with severe PKU) was approved in the U.S. in 2018 and Europe in 2019 and will help mitigate the hit. Vimizim, for Morquio A syndrome, was approved in 2014 and is BioMarin's largest drug, with sales north of $600 million; with patent protection through 2029 in the U.S. and Europe, we expect peak sales around $1 billion. While Brineura (approved in 2017 for CLN2 disease) is a smaller opportunity, we expect sales to gradually ramp north of $300 million as treatment expands the prevalent population for this severe neurodegenerative disease. We think BioMarin's moat extends well beyond patents. Enzymes to treat rare genetic diseasesincluding Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, and Vimizimare quite difficult to manufacture reliably, as Genzyme (now part of Sanofi) showed with its viral contamination issues in 2009. This, coupled with the fact that most of BioMarin's drugs hover below blockbuster status, could make them less profitable targets for generics firms, once the costs of manufacturing, clinical trials, and global marketing are tallied. In other words, we think ultra-rare forms of skeletal dysplasia and rare metabolic disorders are markets that are most effectively served by one firm, so efficient scale serves as another source for BioMarin's narrow moat. BioMarin's products qualify for several years of market exclusivity, based on their orphan drug status.BioMarin's newest rare-disease drugsachondroplasia drug Voxzogo (approved 2021-22) and hemophilia A gene therapy Roctavian (approved 2022-23)are further diversifying the firm's revenue, pushing the firm further into profitability. BioMarin has several gene therapies, enzyme replacements, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecules at the preclinical stage, with renal disease drug BMN255 and hereditary angioedema gene therapy BMN331 now in phase 1. We do not include these phase 1 programs in our model, but we are watching closely for initial efficacy data to determine a probability weighting for our sales forecasts.","BioMarin has several approved products in its portfolio, but high R&D expenses have prevented BioMarin from turning a significant profit. While Roctavian and Voxzogo launches position BioMarin to significantly expand growth over the next few years, the firm's remaining pipeline is fairly early stage, and competitive threats to either of these launches could stall growth. Questions remain about Roctavian's durability and commercial demand, given other effective (yet chronic) treatments. Therefore, we assign the firm a High Uncertainty Rating. Our uncertainty rating is not materially affected by environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, although we see access to basic services (tied to drug pricing) as the biggest ESG risk that BioMarin needs to manage. We see BioMarin as less exposed than its peers to U.S. pricing risks, given that less than 50% of BioMarin's sales are derived from the U.S. market, less than 10% of U.S. sales go through Medicare, the firm has set relatively steady global prices, and cost-effectiveness measures often break down when applied to extremely rare diseases (where firms would be unlikely to develop new medicines without the prospect of strong pricing). Based on the Inflation Reduction Act, we assume a 1% step down in U.S. sales from Medicare Part D redesign in 2025, although we don't factor Medicare inflation caps or negotiation into our model for BioMarin, given its low exposure. We assume a less than 25% probability of BioMarin seeing future costs related to product governance ESG risks (off-label marketing, side effect litigation), and therefore we do not include annual legal costs in our valuation. ","We assign BioMarin a Standard Capital Allocation rating. The rating reflects our belief that BioMarin possesses a sound balance sheet, fair investments outlook, and appropriate shareholder distributions. As of the end of 2022, BioMarin held a net cash position, and the first $495 million of its $1.1 billion in convertible debt comes due in August 2024. We expect a significant improvement in BioMarin's profitability beginning in 2023 with the launches of Roctavian (hemophilia A gene therapy) and Voxzogo (achondroplasia) to make it easier for the firm to maintain its sound balance sheet and continue to invest in R&D and new collaborations and acquisitions. We're slightly concerned about BioMarin's relatively modest historical amount of collaborations and acquisitions. We think in-house development (including Vimizim and Palynziq) as well as its acquired gene therapy platform have largely supported the firm's strong pipeline and rare-disease strategy, despite setbacks with some acquired pipeline candidates. The 2014 acquisition of Prosensa for $680 million has been a failure, given the 2016 termination of development of lead Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug drisapersen and several follow-on drugs, although preclinical development continues with DMD oligonucleotide therapy BMN 351. BioMarin has also had several early-stage clinical programs fizzle over the past several years, including BMN 250 (Sanfilippo type B, outlicensed in 2019), BMN 290 (Friedrich's ataxia, acquired from Repligen in 2014 and discontinued in 2019), and BMN 701 (Pompe disease, acquired with Zystor, discontinued 2016). That said, the Roctavian program was originally acquired from University College London and appears to have strong commercial potential. In addition, BioMarin has invested in gene therapy via both internal manufacturing and R&D as well as collaborations, such as the 2020 cardiovascular gene therapy collaboration with Dinaqor. BioMarin does not pay a dividend or repurchase shares (outside of the one-time $50 million share repurchase in 2020 in connection with the issuance of new convertible debt), which we think is appropriate given the firm's current focus on building the pipeline both with internal innovation and in-licensing products from other firms.","BioMarin's focus is on rare-disease therapies. Genzyme (now part of Sanofi) markets Aldurazyme through its joint venture with BioMarin, and BioMarin markets Naglazyme, Vimizim, and Brineura independently. BioMarin also markets Kuvan and Palynziq to treat the rare metabolic disorder PKU (in addition to long-standing U.S. rights, BioMarin has reacquired international rights for Kuvan and Palynziq from Merck KGaA). Voxzogo (vosoritide) was approved in achondroplasia in 2021. BioMarin's Roctavian (hemophilia A gene therapy) was approved in Europe in 2022 and in the U.S. in 2023.","BioMarin ended 2022 with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments and $1.1 billion convertible debt. Given its recent turn to profitability, we think the firm will have plenty of cash on hand to pay down its convertible debt coming due in 2024 ($495 million) and 2027 ($600 million). Our current free cash flow estimates suggest that BioMarin will not need external financing to fund its operations going forward.

24/11/2023,ANZ Group Margins Soften Despite Costly Home Loan Market Share Gains ,ANZ Group Holdings Ltd,ANZ,4,13/11/2023,Nathan Zaia,24.4,AUD,24/11/2023,31.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,13/11/2023,"ANZ Groups 14% increase in fiscal 2023 cash profit to a record AUD 7.4 billion is largely as we expected. The result was driven by net interest margins up 7 basis points to 1.7%, loan growth of 5%, and bad debt expenses remaining low at 4 basis points of average loans. Earnings weakened over the year, with second-half profit down 6% on the first half, and this negative earnings trajectory likely why ANZ Group continues to trade at a material discount to our unchanged AUD 31 fair value estimate. We have lowered our short-term forecasts around 5% on lower NIM and higher operating expense forecasts. But we expect competitive pressures to ease as refinancing activity slows, new lending picks up, and the term funding facility is repaid. We expect bad debt expenses to revert to close to the 10-year average of 16 basis points, supported by good levels of bad debt provisions and credit quality. Our ANZ Group midcycle forecasts are for low-single-digit loan growth, NIM to stabilize at 1.75%, the cost/income ratio of 46% versus the 49% reported in fiscal 2023, delivering a reasonable return on equity of around 11% for the wide-moat major bank. Despite ANZ Bank having a larger exposure to institutional and commercial lending and deposits compared with peers, which are not seeing the same margin pressures as mortgages and retail deposits, it did not outperform peers. We attribute this to a seemingly strategic decision to win back market share in home loans. ANZ Bank grew home loans 8% compared with market growth of 4.9%, lifting market share to 13.4% from 13.0%. On our forecasts for ANZ Group, ROE falls to around 9.2% in fiscal 2024 from 10.9% in fiscal 2023. Subsequent aggressive mortgage pricing will get harder to justify and we expect it will ease over the next 12 months. Dividends surprised, with lower franking offset by an additional payment. The final dividend of AUD 0.94 per share is made up of AUD 0.81 franked at 65% and an additional unfranked dividend of AUD 0.13.",ANZ continues to win back market share in home loans and retail customer deposits after rolling out an improved digital offering. A large institutional client base and geographic footprint leaves ANZ well placed to support customers transitioning to net zero. Nonbank lenders and even nonmajor banks reliant on wholesale funding and equity markets cede market share back to the major banks in a rising rate environment.,"ANZ Bank remains subpeer for returns on equity, cost efficiency, and net interest margins. Sourcing more funding from institutional customer deposits, which are more price-sensitive, ANZ has less margin upside from higher interest cash rates than major bank peers.  Assuming ANZ acquires Suncorp Bank, issues with loan processing and integration result in the bank ceding market share and spending more than originally guided on integration.",13/11/2023,"ANZ Group is the owner of ANZ Bank, the smallest of Australia's four major banks by market value and the largest bank in New Zealand and the Pacific, offering a full range of banking and financial services to the consumer, small business, and corporate sectors. Like the other major banks, ANZ Bank has a well-recognized and trusted bank brand, large advertising and marketing budget, and customer fulfilment capacity (branches, systems, funding capacity) to capitalize on this brand equity. We see the firms strategy to simplify and focus on its highly profitable core banking operations as logical. The proposed acquisition of Suncorp Bank came as a surprise but provides an avenue to leverage benefits of recent investment in its retail banking platform. Integration risk can not be ignored, but overall we believe the acquisition makes strategic sense.  Tight underwriting standards, lender's mortgage insurance, low average loan/valuation ratios, a high incidence of loan prepayment, full recourse lending, a high proportion of variable rate home loans, and the scope for interest-rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia, or RBA, combine to mitigate potential losses from mortgage lending.  The main current influences on earnings growth are modest credit growth, with households and businesses adjusting to lower borrowing capacity after a sharp increase in rates and slowing economic growth. Businesses are expected to be more cautious on making large investments as households rein in discretionary spending. Margins are softening as the banks compete aggressively in a low credit growth and high refinance market, but we expect competition to be rational in the medium term. Operating expenses are increasing due to regulatory and compliance project spend, as well as investments to make the bank more efficient and competitive across its digital offeringsnamely home loans and savings. In Asia, ANZ Bank targets large clients and has walked away from lending to small business. Given ANZ Bank would have no competitive advantage against local (and much larger) lenders, we support the revised strategy.","We assign ANZ Group a wide moat rating based on maintainable cost advantages and switching costs. ANZ Bank is the smallest of the four major Australian banks, which combined control around 75% of business and consumer lending and a similar share of deposits. Although smaller than some peers, with between 13% and 14% share of business and home loans in Australia, it dwarfs its next largest rivals with around 5% share. Despite regulatory changes lifting capital requirements, the banks large loan and deposit books continue to deliver robust net fee income, and with the increasing importance of scale to cope with changes in technology and regulation, ANZ Group should consistently earn returns above its 9% cost of equity through the cycle.Bank moats are typically derived from two sources: cost advantages and switching costs. Cost advantage is an important source of the bank's wide economic moat, and supported by a low-cost deposit base, operating efficiency, and conservative underwriting relative to peers. Given the commoditized nature of the industry, and competition for both loans and deposits, low costs is key to achieving excess returns. A key pillar of ANZ Banks funding cost advantage is the AUD 650 billion or 60% of funding which is sourced from customer deposits. In addition to customer apathy making deposits sticky, market leading digital and mobile applications, and the large presence, gives major banks an edge when it comes to gathering and retaining deposits. In contrast, the lower rated regional banks struggle to access senior debt markets and rely primarily on more expensive residential securitization markets for a large share of their wholesale funding. All of Australias major banks operate on much better cost/income ratios than smaller competitors and most overseas non-investment banks. Large banks can disperse fixed costs across a larger operating base, increasing operating efficiency. A large and diversified loan book, as well as having the resources and data to support robust credit decisions, also supports a low bad debt/gross loan ratio. While legacy systems can make innovation more costly, we believe the banks large annual spend on technology, and large customer data sets and insights, will see it remain at the forefront of a continually evolving digital offering.The ability to provide customers a full suite of products, and marketing to support already well-known and trusted brands, has historically allowed the major banks to charge a premium on their loans relative to smaller competitors and offer deposit rates lower than competitors. The premium is not offset by higher funding or operating costs, enabling the major banks to generate consistent excess returns. ANZ Banks ability to offer customers multiple products not only increases profitability per customer, but bolsters switching costs. Bank customers often resist moving financial service providers due to the hassle of opening/closing accounts, the lack of perceived benefit, and numerous deposit and payment links. An aggregated view of all personal and financial information, updated in real time, is also advantageous to customers taking multiple products. The cost advantage allows for the strong digital investment and offering, which in turn helps to entrench the switching costs. We believe switching costs in small and medium business banking are reinforced by relationship managers, specialized sector expertise, breadth of product offerings, and the customers additional focus on system reliability. The threat of losing business due to teething problems after switching banks often outweighs anticipated gains from converting. On the other hand, we believe competitive advantages in the institutional banking division are less pronounced, as clients often bank with multiple financial institutions. The capital required to play in the space does limit the threat of disruption from new competitors. Despite being a lower margin and ROE division, the institutional banking segment does support the retail and business bank moats through deposit gathering of low-cost funds which can be redeployed in the higher return on risk weighted asset retail business. There are a variety of regional and community banks, global banks and neo-banks which provide competition. Despite this, the major banks have been able to earn higher returns on equity for the last several decades, and still do so today. In our view, this demonstrates the barriers to entry in attempting to break down the competitive advantages of the majors. Foreign banks have not made a serious dent in the domestic majors' market share, while the smaller regional banks compete on service and local brand recognition but face higher wholesale funding costs than the majors and are unable to undercut on price. They tend to follow the majors in loan and deposit pricing. The Australian government's ""four pillars"" policy prevents any of the four major banks from taking over each other, negating the risk of peers merging to gain greater scale and competitive advantages. Government legislation limits individual ownership of an Australian bank to a maximum of 15% without the approval of the Federal Treasurer, thereby reducing the potential for a foreign takeover. Our outlook is generally positive from a macroeconomic and political standpoint, unemployment remains low, a perception of safety and government services supports population growth through immigration and low GDP growth is forecast to continue.","ANZ Bank is a major Australian bank exposed to most segments of the economy, and therefore will likely suffer from any material deterioration in economic conditions. Higher interest rates, inflation and unemployment can reduce loan growth and increase bad and doubtful debt expense, while exchange-rate volatility can affect certain business sectors. ANZ Bank might not be adequately provisioned for a significant increase in bad debts. A substantial loss of market share in any major segment, coupled with a contraction in net interest margins as the bank competes more aggressively on price, could diminish net interest income. Higher-than-expected costs to integrate Suncorp Bank, or disruptions to business operations are added risks. We believe taking all these factors into consideration makes a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium most appropriate.Australian banks are tightly regulated and exposed to adverse regulatory changes. A slow approval process can see mortgage brokers direct flow to other banks. At the same time, the bank must ensure appropriate risk management and lending standards or risk rising loan losses in the future, especially if house prices are falling.ANZ Groups environmental, social, and governance risks primarily relate to breaches of law and regulatory requirements, unfair treatment of customers, protection of customer data, and lending exposure to environmental and socially sensitive sectors. In our view, the combined probability and materiality of these ESG-related risks is small relative to the cash flows of the bank, and we make no specific allowances in our forecasts.Exposure to high ESG risk businesses, including power generation and mining, are a risk in relation to market shifts toward responsible and maintainable finance. ANZ Bank has a larger exposure to nonrenewable electricity generation assets than peers, making it at greatest risk should the transition to renewable energy be quicker than estimated. ","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to ANZ Group.The balance sheet is sound, comfortably meeting the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority benchmark. CEO Shayne Elliot took the helm in 2016 and changed strategy, simplified the bank, and revamped senior management. The focus on retail, commercial, and institutional banking is expected to improve earnings over the long term.When it comes to shareholder distributions, we think ANZ Group has set an appropriate dividend payout range considering the capital position, outlook for loan growth, M&A opportunities, and loan-loss provisions.","ANZ Group is the owner of one of Australia's four major banks and provides retail, business, and institutional banking services to customers in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia-Pacific. The super-regional Asian strategy was de-emphasized, with management focusing on the higher-returning businesses in Australia and New Zealand. ANZ Bank still retains a tilt to its Asia-centric strategy, but is now more balanced, better capitalized and a simpler bank.","ANZ Group is in good financial health. ANZ Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at Sept. 30 was 13.3%, comfortably above the regulator's minimum benchmark and management's target of 11% to 11.5%. ANZ Group raised AUD 3.5 billion to help fund the potential acquisition of Suncorp Bank, with the difference funded from existing capital. On a pro forma basis, the common equity Tier 1 ratio for ANZ Bank falls to around 12.1%. The proportion of customer deposits to total funding is above 60%, reducing exposure to volatile funding markets. Issuance of covered bonds will incrementally diversify the funding base. Total liquid assets exceed total offshore wholesale debt, and ANZ Bank could theoretically afford to retire all its offshore wholesale debt in the event that these debt markets close and the maturing debt cannot be rolled.

25/11/2023,Sluggish Intermodal Activity and Wage Inflation a Headache for Union Pacific This Year ,Union Pacific Corp,UNP,3,,Matthew Young,223.49,USD,23/11/2023,204.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,A,,No Text Available,"Network service levels have gradually improved off a lackluster performance in 2021 and much of 2022 thanks to progress hiring train and engine personnel. PSR efforts yielded impressive improvement in UP's operating ratio (expenses/revenue) between 2019 and 2021. Despite service setbacks in 2022, we expect UP will continue to refine its PSR playbook in the years ahead.  Compared with trucking, shipping by rail is less expensive for long distances and is four times more fuel-efficient per ton-mile. These factors should help support longer-term incremental intermodal growth.","Muted total-volume growth and significant wage inflation from the new labor contracts will preclude OR improvement in 2023, despite recovering network fluidity.  Terminal congestion has diminished, but muted retailer restocking and depressed rates in the competing truckload sector are tempering intermodal demand this year.  The STB oversees railroads pricing, so there will always be underlying risk of reregulation in terms of a policy shift to a more heavy-handed approach.",20/10/2023,"Since roughly 2018, all the rails have confronted the push to implement precision scheduled railroading, or PSR, if they hadnt already. Shareholders have demanded it, motivated by PSRs initial success at Canadian National and Canadian Pacific. Union Pacific is no exception, launching its own PSR efforts in late 2018. UPs operating ratio (expenses/revenue) was in a better position than other railroads when its rollout started, but PSR has proved to be the surest path to greater network efficiency and higher incremental margins. UPs initial margin success came a few decades after partial deregulation in 1980, as it eliminated unprofitable routes and boosted efficiency during industry consolidation. When carloads slid 16% in 2009, UP nimbly cut costs faster than sales declined, then steadily improved its operating ratio, or OR, from 2010 to 2015. Even an 18% coal carload decline in 2015 couldn't keep UP from reaching record margins, though another painful 20% coal decline in 2016 constrained improvement. The next major step up in profitability occurred between 2019 and 2021 as UP implemented PSR and reached a record annual OR of 57.2% in 2021. Despite margin setbacks over the past two yearsinitially linked to labor-related network headwinds, then heavy wage inflation from the new union contractPSR has generally yielded more efficient use of locomotive assets and labor. We expect UP and its peers to grapple with wage hikes, minimal retail sector restocking, and sluggish industrial production in 2023 but look for OR gains to resume in the years ahead as volume trends improve and as the rail refines its PSR playbook. UP still has meaningful exposure to coal, which will face secular declines in the longer term because of stringent environmental regulation. This factor is baked into our model assumptions. Of note, UP's mix of intermodal freight has increased over the past decade. While intermodal is currently grappling with anemic retail end markets and elevated truck competition, we consider it to be a key long-term growth driver for most Class-I railroads due to its potential cost savings for shippers and secular constraints on truckload capacity.","In our view, each of the North American Class I railroads we cover, including Union Pacific, enjoys a wide economic moat rooted in cost advantages and efficient scale. Core pricing and margin resilience in past freight recessions and in the face of substantial coal volume losses over the past decade-plus are a testament to their robust competitive positioning. With near certainty, we expect the rails to continue to turn their two core moat sources into economic profit for the next 10 years, and more likely than not 20 years from now.Cost advantage is a key factor in UP's wide economic moat. While barges, ocean liners, aircraft, and trucks also haul freight, railroads are by far the low-cost option where no waterway connects the origin and destination, especially for freight with low value-per-unit weight (bulk commodities). Along those lines, railroads enjoy roughly quadruple the fuel efficiency of trucking (per ton-mile of freight), and through greater railcar capacity and train length, rails make more effective use of locomotive assets and manpower despite the need for train yard personnel. Rails can also carry significantly more freight at once. Even for freight that can be shipped by truck, we estimate railroads enjoy a 10%-30% discount on a similar lane (on average). Marine shipping by barge is less costly than rail for certain bulk commodity shippers that are located near the inland waterways offering access to the desired destination. However, customers in a position to ship via barge already do so, thus removing any threats barging could pose to current railroad volume. Even for intermodal container freight, which consists largely of consumer-related products, rail has historically been cheaper than its key competitor truckload shipping on average over the cycle thanks to the rails aforementioned fuel efficiency and more economical use of labor. Furthermore, route density plays a role in rails cost advantage relative to a would-be new railroad entrant in a given corridor. We dont expect any new mainlines to be built, but the incumbent Class I providers would enjoy vastly lower unit and marginal costs than an upstart, given immense network/lane density--the existing seven North American Class I railroads have thousands of customers across numerous end markets and geographies that drive significant freight volumes across their networks.In addition to cost advantage, the Class I railroads benefit from efficient scale. Would-be rational competitors have little incentive to enter because massive up-front infrastructure costs and the potential for creating excess capacity amid limited demand would preclude economic profit and destroy value. The network of track and assets that U.S. Class I railroads have in place is essentially impossible to replicate. UP's network spans the Western U.S., from the Pacific to the Mississippi, capturing roughly half of the rail volume in the region. Would-be entrants are fended off by the steep barrier to entry formed by the need to obtain contiguous rights of way on which to lay continuously welded steel rail spanning a significant portion of North America. Railroads occasionally build new spurs, but we anticipate no new mainlines will be built, given the massive barriers to entry.Efficient scale followed industry consolidation escalated by the 1980 Staggers Act, which permitted extensive rail line sales, abandonment, and combination while allowing for private contracts and rate setting based on market demand. In 1980, more than 40 Class I rails operated across North America, and today there are only seven; by definition, a Class I rail generates at least $475 million of revenue. Consequently, on all but the busiest lanes, a single railroad often serves an end-of-the-line shipper, only two railroads operate in most regions, and the rails have been able to reinvest while becoming quite profitable. In fact, we suspect that barring government intervention the rational number of competitors on the continent would be two, via additional consolidation. This is because in most regions, customers already have only two capable providers that service the market effectively and efficiently.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Union Pacific is Medium. Like all railroads, UP's carload activity is correlated to the health of North American industrial production, while intermodal demand is influenced by goods consumption, retail-sector inventory restocking, and pricing in the competing truckload sector.Coal demand has contracted over the past decade (on average) as utilities substituted renewable energy sources and due to periodically inexpensive natural gas. We expect secular volume deterioration to persist longer term due to stringent EPA-driven regulatory restrictions and related utility plant closings. That said, PRB coal is cheaper than Central Appalachian or Illinois Basin coal and positions UP well for periods of high natural gas prices. In terms of ESG-related risks, because UP carries freight for chemical end-market shippers, it is subject to the liabilities associated with hazardous material spills. Furthermore, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board oversees railroads pricing, so there will always be underlying risk of reregulation. In fact, regulatory risk is currently elevated given heightened STB scrutiny of sluggish rail service, the Norfolk Southern derailment, and comments on potential reform such as reciprocal switching. We note that the STB has taken on a more active stance lately under chairman Martin Oberman (appointed by President Joe Biden). That said, severe reregulation isnt a foregone conclusion, should cooler heads prevail. The STBs long-standing market-based approach has provided a balanced regulatory framework yielding a relatively small number of annual rate cases and reasonable outcomes that are often settled.UP is party to collective bargaining agreements. Along those lines, the union contract secured in December 2022 and recent supplemental agreements are driving significant wage inflation. ","We award Union Pacific a Standard capital allocation rating, which reflects our assessment that the rail's balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing is reasonable and generally supports its strong competitive positioning. We consider shareholder distributions to be appropriate. UP consistently returns cash to shareholders via share repurchases and rising dividends. We were pleased that UP appointed former COO and precision scheduled railroading, or PSR, specialist Jim Vena as its new CEO, effective in mid-August. Earlier this year, the firm announced that CEO Lance Fritz (in his role since 2015) would be stepping down. We believe that was sparked by pressure from activist investor Soroban Capital, which, via a letter, called for Fritz's departure (on the grounds of ""operating underperformance"" in recent years) and suggested that UP bring back Jim Vena to take the reins. Overall, we consider hiring Vena a positive development, and it gives us greater confidence in our medium-term margin improvement forecasts. Vena was UP's COO from early 2019 through late 2020 and helped successfully implement PSR, which drove material operational improvement and OR gains for UP during that timeframe. He previously served as COO of Canadian National--the railroad at which Hunter Harrison initially put PSR to work. Recall that PSR focuses heavily on high service levels, asset utilization, and efficient use of labor and fuel. Its accomplished in part by closing sorting yards and lengthening trains, which reduces train starts, lowers labor costs, cuts terminal dwell time, and enables rails to cut the size of their locomotive fleet. Rob Knight's tenure as CFO came to a close at the end of 2019. He had held the role since 2004 and helped engineer UP's pre-PSR profitability progress. The firm appointed Jennifer Hamann as CFO upon Knight's retirement. Hamann has a solid resumeshe was previously senior vice president of finance and joined UP in 1992. Eric Gehringer took over as executive vice president of operations in January 2021, following Jim Vena's original retirement from the role. Gehringer was previously vice president of transportation and has been at Union Pacific for more than 15 years.","Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific is the largest public railroad in North America. Operating on more than 30,000 miles of track in the western two thirds of the U.S., UP generated $25 billion of revenue in 2022 by hauling coal, industrial products, intermodal containers, agriculture goods, chemicals, and automotive goods. UP owns about one fourth of Mexican railroad Ferromex and derives roughly 10% of its revenue hauling freight to and from Mexico.","Union Pacific has a fair amount of debt, but it historically generates solid free cash flow and its overall balance sheet is healthy. The company relies primarily on senior unsecured notes. At year-end 2022, the firm had total debt of $33.3 billion ($29.7 billion in 2021; $26.7 billion in 2020), and its total debt/EBITDA ratio stood at a manageable 2.7 times (similar to 2021 levels), with EBITDA/interest near 9 times. We expect debt/EBITDA near 2.6 times in 2023. We note that the fair value of pension assets exceeded pension liabilities (excluding OPEB liabilities) in 2022. At the end of 2022, UP held cash and equivalents of roughly $973 million. During 2022, the firm refinanced/replaced its $2 billion revolving credit facility, which now expires in early 2027it was undrawn at year-end. In our view, the firm has ample liquidity, and we don't expect it to encounter issues servicing its debt requirements in the years ahead.",UNP,Industrials,141042696192.0,NYQ,3220766.0,USD,223.4900054931641,True,0,212.96959318272707,241.7428760293086,1
24/11/2023,Rapid7s Competitive Landscape Remains Tough as It Seeks Returns on Its Cybersecurity Solutions,Rapid7 Inc,RPD,3,02/11/2023,Malik Khan,51.94,USD,23/11/2023,45.0,Very High,,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"We maintain our $45 fair value estimate for no-moat Rapid7 after the firm reported third-quarter earnings in line with our revenue estimates, while delivering upside on profitability. Management increased its full-year 2024 outlook, as well as guiding for a sequentially stronger fourth quarter on the revenue front. While we see secular tailwinds blow in Rapid7s favor along with a more normalized demand environment, we remain wary of the firms fierce competition and exposure to macroeconomic swings. With current shares up 8% after-hours, we view the stock as slightly overvalued.  Third-quarter sales clocked in at $199 million, up 13% from the prior-year period. Sales in the quarter were driven by revenue from products, up 14% year over year. However, they were partially offset by a decline in professional services revenue as the firm restructured its services offerings. Annualized recurring revenue increased 14% year over year to $777 million. We were pleased to see 40% of new ARR stem from Threat Complete and Cloud Risk Complete solutions, displaying demand for the firms bundled offerings. On profitability, the non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5%, compared with 7.4% from the prior-year period. We believe margin expansion is largely driven by Rapid7s recent restructuring, where the firm has streamlined its sales expenses and reduced its workforce. Following the initial impact of the restructuring, we expect margins to improve at a modest pace, supported by lower expenses and scaling efficiencies.","Rapid7 has strong secular tailwinds in endpoint security and security operations where both markets are projected to grow rapidly. Rapid7 has the ability to upsell modules to customers and therefore increase its stickiness overtime. Rapid7 has ample opportunity to capture business within the SMB space, where the firm is less likely to run into competition against larger players.","The firm will likely have poor operating leverage and cash flow for the next few years, making it difficult to invest in order to stay competitive. Rapid7 faces competition from vendors like CrowdStrike and Splunk, which are much larger and more well-capitalized than Rapid7. As Rapid7 primarily serves small and midsize businesses, or SMBs, the firm might be more susceptible to macroeconomic swings and higher levels of churn.",05/10/2023,"Rapid7 is a prominent vendor in security operations and threat detection, which we view as key components of the cybersecurity stack, and which stand to gain wallet share of customers' spending as firms digitize their workflows. While secular tailwinds blow in Rapid7s favor, we are wary of the firms fierce competition and exposure to macro swings. We also anticipate that the firms investments to expand its portfolio may take time to bear fruit. The cybersecurity space continues to grow in threat complexity and intensity. As firms undergo digital transformations that expand their online footprints, the number of attack vectors is rapidly increasing. In this evolving landscape, we see information technology security teams opting for vendors that offer multiple security solutions versus point solutions that can inadvertently create data silos. This creates an opportunity for vendors to displace point solutions with interoperable modules. Rapid7 began providing vulnerability management, or VM, solutions, designed to help firms identify and mitigate weaknesses in their IT environment. However, given the secular shift toward cybersecurity vendor consolidation, the firm has added several modules spanning security operations and threat detection and response, delivered under its Insights platform. While the increase in nefarious activity has induced greater cybersecurity spending, it has also brought on intense competition among vendors. Rapid7s competitive landscape includes significantly larger public cloud vendors, such as Microsoft, as well as pure-play cybersecurity providers such as CrowdStrike. These larger, more well-capitalized firms provide solutions that directly compete with the Insights platform, laying a tough competitive landscape for the smaller Rapid7. Rapid7 has heavily invested in research and sales and has made several acquisitions to expand its portfolio beyond its vulnerability management roots. As a result, the firm has incurred hefty operating losses and debt in recent years. Looking ahead, we expect growth to be fueled by the firms newer modules. However, we believe it may take several years for the firm to turn a profit. ","We assign Rapid7 a no-moat rating as we believe the company will continue to generate operating losses in the next few years that will likely prevent it from achieving excess returns on invested capital over the next decade. While we believe Rapid7 is well-exposed to secular tailwinds within the cybersecurity industry, we currently do not see the typical moat sources taking hold at the company to the same degree as we would expect for narrow- or wide-moat rated cybersecurity vendors.Looking to the broader cybersecurity segment, we believe the complexity and intensity of threats are ever-increasing. As enterprises undergo digital transformations and cloud migrations which expand their digital footprints, the number of attack vectors is rapidly increasing. In response to this escalating threat level, IT teams are adopting more cybersecurity tools. However, in many instances, the adoption of more tools creates data silos in which disparate solutions are not interoperable. This lack of interoperability presents the opportunity for cybersecurity vendors to provide multiple solutions within one basket, displacing vendors providing only point solutions. Vendors like Rapid7 are able to entrench solutions across client workflows, and further grow wallet share among customers as their needs evolve in an increasingly digitized world. For example, an IT team may adopt Rapid7s vulnerability management solution in order to gain greater visibility into the risks present in their internal IT environment. As the customer grows, as do the number of attack vectors, the IT security team may onboard additional modules from Rapid7 like its threat intelligence module, allowing the firm to expand usage within a customer while also entrenching itself further into the customers security apparatus.As security vendors entrench numerous safety solutions into clients' IT infrastructure, we see switching costs increase, as it becomes more costly and difficult to rip out and replace security solutions. The transition to a new vendor and re-training of staff on a new platform creates a period of increased expense and vulnerability. Enterprises have high loss aversion in regard to security which makes switching from a functioning platform unlikely. As well, this loss aversion leads to enterprises opting for the most reputable and reliable solution, rather than selecting solely on price.Rapid7's Insights platform is well-armed with tools to defend businesses against modern-day cyber-attacks across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. We are impressed with Rapid7's portfolio expansion over the last decade through addition of new security modules. However, the competitive landscape for security vendors is tough, with Rapid7 going up against strong platform vendors across its portfolio. For instance, take Rapid7s InsightsIDR solution. Here, next-gen SIEM, or security information and event management, is offered, as well as extended detection and response (XDR). SIEM takes high volumes of data and produces a real-time analysis of a companys security infrastructure. XDR, a nascent subsector, collects and automatically correlates data across multiple endpoints for detection of threats as well as response. In todays world with ever-increasing threats and endpoints, there is heightened demand for solutions like InsightsIDR. However, Rapid7 faces stiff competition from the likes of narrow-moat CrowdStrike and Splunk (being acquired by Cisco), both leaders in XDR and SIEM, respectively. As well as these vendors, larger security players like Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet have been expanding into these security end-markets, creating further competition for smaller vendors like Rapid7.While Rapid7s platform suggests a sticky offering, we do not see evidence of switching costs. The company does not report its gross or net retention, making it difficult to ascertain its customer lifetime and stickiness of its solutions. Further, as a vendor with substantial exposure to the small and medium sized business market, wed expect Rapid7s churn to be higher than its security peers focusing on the enterprise market.Further, Rapid7 has heavily invested in research and sales and made several acquisitions to expand its security portfolio. As a result, the firm has incurred hefty operating losses and taken on substantial debt. We expect it will be a few years before the firm turns an economic profit and out-earns its cost of capital. As well, we fear the firms large debt balance will prohibit further investment in its platform to stay competitive with its peers; many of whom have much stronger cash-flow generation profiles as well as greater cash in hand. Due to the firms lack of profitability in the near-to-medium term, we do not foresee Rapid7 generating excess returns on capital, which precludes us from assigning an economic moat rating to the firm.","We assign Rapid7 a Very High uncertainty rating due to the competition the firm faces in security operations (SIEM, SOAR and managed services) and XDR. The firm has heavily invested to grow these areas, at the expense of its profitability and cash flow.As the firm has expanded from its vulnerability management roots, its competition has intensified. Large cybersecurity vendors have a greater breadth of offerings compared with Rapid7, making these firms more attractive for enterprise customers wishing to consolidate their needs onto a singular platform. These platform vendors have solutions that directly compete with Rapid7s high growth modules. CrowdStrike, for instance, leads the XDR market and Splunk is the leader in security operations. While Rapid7s focus is skewed toward SMBs, we view enterprise clients as the gold standard for SaaS companies. Their annual contract values, or ACVs, are typically in the millions of dollars, and they are stickier than smaller clients, which are subject to higher churn.Similar to many software firms across our coverage, Rapid7 invests heavily in its sales and research departments, and has also completed several acquisitions in recent years to expand its portfolio. Due to high spending, the firm is yet to achieve GAAP profitability. As well, the firm has accumulated a large debt balance. We fear the firms poor leverage will prohibit further investment in its platform to stay competitive with its peers; many of whom have much stronger cash-flow generation profiles. For these reasons, we anticipate the firm may face challenges in capturing its long-term opportunity and must execute well in the coming years.Regarding environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, we do not foresee any material ESG issues. However, notable risks include attracting and retaining talent, which could demand high remuneration. Also, Rapid7s solutions are tasked with protecting customers from cyberattacks, making data privacy a key concern.","We assign Rapid7 a standard capital allocation rating based on its weak balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate distributions.We think Rapid7s balance sheet is weak. With $290 million in cash versus over $815 million in debt due within the next few years, we have concern that Rapid7 will not have sufficient cash flow from its business to cover commitments. As well, given that Rapid7 mainly caters to small and midsize businesses, or SMBs, the firm is more exposed to downside risk from macroeconomic shocks. With these factors as well as Rapid7s negative free cash flow, we suspect it will be likely that the firm refinances its debt in the future.Rapid7 has invested heavily to expand beyond its vulnerability management roots, providing multiple modules in endpoint security and security operations. With the secular shift toward cybersecurity vendor consolidation, the firm has assembled a portfolio in which customers can opt for several Rapid7 solutions to fit their security needs. As well, the firm has entered into nascent end markets such as SIEM and XDR, which have higher expected growth than the mature vulnerability management market.However, as a result of aggressive investment, the firms operating leverage and cash flow has suffered, and it is yet to outearn its cost of capital. While we believe the firm has secular tailwinds from cybersecurity end markets blowing in its favor, it may be a while before excess returns on capital are realized. Fierce competition in these markets and the lack of clarity around Rapid7s own retention increases further impedes our confidence.Rapid7 does not pay a dividend, nor does the business plan to anytime soon. We view this as appropriate given the firms portfolio expansion strategy and subsequent negative cash flow.In considering returning capital to shareholders, we would be remiss not to mention that  Rapid7s debt is mainly in the form of senior convertible notes. If these were to be converted into equity, this would have a dilutive effect on current shares.","Founded in 2000, Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that began providing vulnerability management solutions. It has, however, expanded its portfolio to provide extended detection and response, or XDR; security information and event management, or SIEM; cloud security, threat intelligence, and application security; and security orchestration, automation, and response, or SOAR. The Boston-based company went public in 2015.","We view Rapid7s financial position as weak. The firm ended fiscal 2022 with $290 million in cash and liquid investments and more than $815 million in debt. As well, we forecast the firm will be cash flow negative in the upcoming years. We anticipate Rapid7 will not have sufficient cash flow from its business to cover commitments over our explicit forecast and further expect the firm to either refinance its debt in the coming years or slash its operating expenses (and perhaps face lower revenue growth) in order to preserve capital.While the firm is in an investment phase with operating profitability and cash flow margins both in the red, we expect Rapid7s cash generation to improve as the firm increases its operating leverage by reducing its research and sales expenditures. With this, we forecast the firm will become free cash flow positive by 2027.However, we do not expect to see a material change in Rapid7s capital structure. We also expect the firm to continue to raise capital through issuing more equity, especially in periods of macroeconomic downturn.",RPD,Technology,3444715264.0,NGM,1065548.0,USD,51.93999862670898,True,0,47.96105876249176,55.82987669957407,1
24/11/2023,APA Is Making Progress Now on Suriname,APA Corp,APA,4,02/11/2023,Stephen Ellis,36.56,USD,23/11/2023,56.0,Very High,,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"APAs third-quarter results were slightly above our expectations, as production was 412,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, a bit better than our 407,000 boe/d forecast. This was primarily attributable to strength in the Permian as well as the North Sea. After refreshing our model for the latest oil and gas prices as well as third-quarter results, our fair value estimate moves up to $56 per share from $55, while our no-moat rating is unchanged. We continue to think that Suriname's potential is mispriced by investors and that APA remains very undervalued. 2024 looks to be a very good year for APA. There will be a full year of contributions from APAs 15-year contract with Cheniere, which started Aug. 1 and added $90 million in cash flow in a partial quarter of contributions. APA expects $375 million in 2024 contributions from this contract. Suriname is also projected to obtain a final investment decision by the end of 2024, with first oil expected by 2028. However, APA is already proceeding with plans for front-end engineering and design on a 200,000 b/d floating production storage and offloading vessel, which suggests a potential acceleration of first oil to 2027. During the call, management commented on the substantial potential for Block 58, where Total is the operator, but it sounds as if further exploration there will be later than 2024.","The modernization of APA's production-sharing contract with the government in Egypt makes incremental investment more attractive and has turned a stable cash cow into a lucrative growth asset. APA has a long runway of drilling opportunities in the high-growth, low-cost Permian basin. APA's discoveries in Suriname are a potential game-changer and could double the firm's production in the next 10 years.","With operations in Egypt, the company is exposed to geopolitical risk in the Middle East. The Arab Spring in the early 2010s serves as an example of unrest. The companys bet on the gas-rich Alpine High in the Delaware Basin puts it out on a ledge versus other Permian players that have not chosen to focus on that area as heavily. Suriname exploration accounts for a large portion of APA's fair value, yet the outcome is highly uncertain: A successful development could drive our estimate much higher, but a complete failure is not out of the question yet.",02/11/2023,"APA is an upstream oil and natural gas producer with assets in the United States and overseas. The vast majority of its domestic production is derived from the Permian Basin. The firm's footprint of 500,000 net acres extends across several subbasins and mainly focuses on the same reservoirs that competitors are targeting (the Spraberry and Wolfcamp intervals in the Midland Basin and the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware). However, APA also has its own discovery in the Permian region, the Alpine High play. Alpine High wells are characterized by very strong initial production rates but with a much higher gas and natural gas liquids content than we'd expect elsewhere in the Permian. This gives the firm optionality: When natural gas prices compare favorably with oil prices, APA can allocate more capital to its gassier assets. APA also holds a large acreage position in Egypt, where it has operated for nearly a quarter of a century. After it modernized its contract with the government there, the asset has come back to the front of the queue for capital, and the firm expects to deliver 1% year-on-year production growth in 2023. Reported volumes could fluctuate, however, as APA's revenue and profits in Egypt are governed by production-sharing contracts (due to cost-recovery provisions in these contracts, lower crude prices translate to higher reported volumes, creating a natural hedge in weak commodity environments, and vice versa). North Sea volumes are no longer a priority after the local government implemented a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, and production will probably peak in 2023. The company's focus has widened to include Suriname following a string of exploration successes in Block 58 (which APA is appraising with its 50/50 partner, TotalEnergies). The evidence to date suggests a very large petroleum system that could be transformative for the company. At this point, we think it is very likely that one or more of the discoveries will progress to the development stage, though none have been officially sanctioned yet. A final investment decision for Suriname is planned by the end of 2024 with first oil in 2028.","APA has historically struggled to meet the threshold for a moat rating by consistently failing to earn its cost of capital. However, it apparently turned the corner in 2021, and our projections now show modest excess returns on invested capital over the next decade. But there's a catch. Commodity prices soared in 2021 and 2022, providing a temporary advantage, and it will be a lot harder for APA to squeeze economic profits from its legacy assets under midcycle conditions ($55/barrel West Texas Intermediate and $3.30/thousand cubic feet natural gas). It is the contribution from its Suriname position that makes APA look moaty in future years. But this is still a highly speculative asset, with a handful of discoveries but no developments yet sanctioned.If it works, it could be a massive prize for APA (just like Guyana was for narrow-moat-rated Hess, APA's most comparable competitor). We expect the Suriname government to offer relatively generous fiscal terms to induce more rapid development, making the potential returns for APA competitive with or even better than what it can earn in the Permian or Egypt. But it could be several years before production commences, assuming that one or more of the discoveries can be commercially developed, and the capital requirements will be heavily front-loaded. So if anything, Suriname is more likely to drag on returns for the next few years. And it's still possible that the discoveries to date are deemed uncommercial and are never developed. Accordingly, we need more confidence in the trajectory of APA's Suriname activity before it can support a moat rating.On a stand-alone basis, APA's other assets also have moaty characteristics. But as with many exploration and production firms, too much capital was invested in prior cycles under the assumption of higher oil prices. After incorporating costs sunk on leasehold, acquisitions, exploration, and infrastructure, APA's capital base inflates to a level that makes high returns on capital difficult.The Permian Basin is the cheapest source of crude oil in the U.S. and sits below other shale plays, deep-water projects, and other unconventional sources on the global cost curve. But within the Permian, well performance does vary. As a result, some of APA's competitors in the region enjoy lower average unit costs and higher internal rates of return. In addition, APA has recently focused on Alpine High, a portion of the southern Delaware Basin that other firms have overlooked. Alpine High wells typically yield very strong flow rates but with a less favorable oil mix. Altogether, wed be hesitant to say that the companys Permian assets have a narrow moat. APAs other main producing assets are in Egypt and the North Sea. The conventional projects in Egypt generate a substantial amount of free cash flow, benefit from Brent pricing, and are probably low enough on the cost curve to be considered moatworthy at the asset level. Political risk is a factor, though the company does have a long and productive record in the country (including the turbulent early 2010s). In the North Sea, Brent pricing props up average realized prices, and operating costs are reasonably low, but production is likely to trend sideways or even decline modestly in the next few years, especially now that the U.K. government has installed a windfall tax on oil and gas operations that makes capital allocation there less attractive. At the corporate level, we dont think steady cash flows from these assets will be enough to pull returns above the weighted average cost of capital.Like all E&P firms, APA is exposed to a range of potential environmental, social, and governance issues that could hurt its ability to generate strong returns. The most significant ESG exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (both from extraction operations and downstream consumption), and other emissions, effluents, and waste (primarily oil spills).Greenhouse gas emissions are the biggest threat, and these are unavoidable for oil producers. Firms can clean up their operations in the field as much as possible by avoiding unnecessary flaring and using technologies like electric fracking and carbon capture to reduce carbon dioxide volumes being released into the atmosphere during the extraction process. APA has started working on a project that eliminates at least 1 million tons of CO2 emissions annually by year-end 2024. However, downstream emissionsat the refinery and beyondare beyond its control, and these account for the vast majority of total emissions. As consumers grow more averse to fossil fuels, the reputational risk rises for producers and the probability of widespread substitution away from fossil fuels increases. This also makes value-destructive regulatory intervention more likely (think fracking restrictions or carbon taxes). These threats are not likely enough to be included in our base-case forecasts, but because the impact would be material, it does further erode the firms moat potential.Because APA operates offshore, in the North Sea, spills are a concern as well. Though the probability is very remote, a devastating accident like the BP Macondo disaster in 2010 could have a material adverse impact on APA (which could be forced to cover cleanup costs and perhaps face other legal repercussions). Spills also occur from time to time during long-haul transit over land, but APA has limited exposure there, as this activity is typically outsourced to midstream firms. So there is no chance that the firm would be on the hook for an event like the Kalamazoo River spill in Michigan, which also occurred in 2010.","We assign APA a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. As with most E&P firms, a deteriorating outlook for oil and natural gas prices would pressure this firms profitability, reduce cash flows, and drive up financial leverage. An increase to federal taxes, or a revocation of the intangible drilling deduction that U.S. firms enjoy, could also affect profitability and reduce our fair value estimate. In addition, with operations in Egypt and a production-sharing contract with the Egyptian government, the company is exposed to geopolitical risk in the Middle East. While the Suriname assets are potentially transformative, it's too early to tell how big of a contribution they will make, and the range of outcomes is massive for this asset, which is a large component of our enterprise value estimate.Material environmental, social, and governance exposures create additional risk for E&P investors. In this industry, the most significant exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (both from extraction operations and downstream consumption) and other emissions, effluents, and waste (primarily oil spills). In addition to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as fracking bans, drilling permit suspensions, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions.","Our Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for APA reflects the firm's moderate balance sheet strength, fair investment strategy, and appropriate distributions.Like many large E&Ps, APA has an acquisitive history and has also sold assets over time as well. Over the years, it has operated in Australia, Argentina, China, and Canada in addition to its key regions today of U.S. onshore, Egypt, the North Sea, and Suriname. This portfolio shuffling has left it with a hefty capital base that has depressed firmwide returns for several years.However, the firm is back on track with its plans for accelerating share repurchases and dividends, now that the balance sheet is in much better shape after the COVID-19-related downturn in 2020. Management reacted swiftly at the time, making dramatic capital cuts with a steep reduction in the dividend payout. In 2021 and 2022, the firm bought back $2.3 billion in stock while paying out a relatively nominal dividend ($259 million). In 2023, buybacks dipped to just $208 million, while dividends through the third quarter totaled $232 million. With the stock materially undervalued, we would hope to see more efforts directed toward repurchases in the near term.When APA made a potentially game-changing discovery in Suriname, it partnered with TotalEnergies in a deal that will give the latter a 50% stake in exchange for taking on the lion's share of the up-front capital burden (the carry requires TotalEnergies to pay $5 billion of the first $7.5 billion in development capital expenditures and 25% of all investment thereafter).","Based in Houston, APA is an independent exploration and production company. It operates primarily in the U.S., Egypt, the North Sea, and Suriname. At year-end 2022, proved reserves totaled 890 million barrels of oil equivalent, with net reported production of 400 thousand boe/day that year (64% of which was oil and natural gas liquids, with the remainder natural gas).","APA has turned the corner after several years of above-average indebtedness. The firm has benefited from disciplined spending coupled with strong commodity prices. At the end of the last reporting period, consolidated debt was $5.6 billion, and on an annualized basis, net debt/EBITDA was 1.1 times.The firm is now expected to continue generating robust free cash flows, even under midcycle conditions. It also has plenty of liquidity in reserve in cash and on its revolver. The revolver does include a covenant ceiling of 60% for debt/capital, but capital is defined to exclude impairments since mid-2015, and on that basis, the firm is nowhere near a violation. Meanwhile, the term structure of the firm's debt is extremely spread out. Only about $100 million comes due before 2025, and only $900 million matures in the five years after that. That means APA can forget about the principal on a large portion of its debt until at least 2030.",APA,Energy,11106305024.0,NMS,3209195.0,USD,36.560001373291016,True,1,40.238811807076466,32.40480981050247,0
24/11/2023,Oneok Starts on the Integration Process for Magellan,ONEOK Inc,OKE,3,01/11/2023,Stephen Ellis,66.66,USD,23/11/2023,62.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,C,01/11/2023,"Oneoks third-quarter results were good, and the firm upped its 2023 EBITDA estimate by $125 million, reflecting very strong volume growth in the Permian/Gulf Coast (18%) and Rockies (6%) regions. Higher fee rates and lower fractionation costs also contributed. Well connections in the Rockies are expected to be a midpoint of 550 wells, up from earlier expectations of 500 wells, while midcontinent wells are expected to be at the high end of the 45-55 range. Rockies volumes are about three times as valuable as midcontinent connections for Oneok. In short, Oneok continues to execute very well, and now must extend that solid execution to integrating Magellan. However, after factoring in the $175 million of transaction costs to close on Magellan, the operational upside is wiped out. Consolidated Magellan and Oneok 2023 EBITDA guidance is $5.1 billion, matching our forecast. Magellan only contributed about $40 million in EBITDA during the quarter as the merger closed in late September. As a result, we do not expect to change our $62 fair value estimate or narrow moat rating. Oneok already expects its initial estimate of $1.5 billion of tax benefits to be exceeded, which we agree can be done, as our model already anticipated it. Our model forecasts about $1.9 billion in net present value attached to tax benefits from 2025-27. The high degree of certainty around capturing these savings means that Oneok only needs to secure another $1.1 billion in value out of the deal via synergies (selling, general, and administrative savings, capital avoidance, asset optimization, or new investment projects) to recover the $3 billion premium paid. Our model assumes about $100 million in SG&A savings (a bit more than 40% of Magellans existing SG&A spending).","Oneok's NGL gathering system is connected to 90% of the processing plants in the midcontinent.  Oneok has a well-integrated network of pipelines in the midcontinent and Texas, providing it with additional opportunities to invest but also take advantage of wider differentials. The firm is well positioned to serve as an exporter of gas to Mexico via its Roadrunner pipeline.","As ethane economics improve and less ethane is rejected, producers could seek to renegotiate Oneok's fee-based G&P contracts to be commodity-based, capturing a portion of the earnings uplift. Investments in gathering and processing assets will help the firm obtain barrels, but they are not moaty assets. Oneok does not have direct export capabilities to international markets such as Europe, which is a promising growth market. ",01/11/2023,"Oneok brings together high-quality assets, some of the strongest near- to medium-term growth prospects in our coverage as Rockies volumes continue their ongoing rebound, a C-Corporation structure, and a well-respected management team in a compelling package. About 90% of the firm's earnings are fee-based, 80%-90% of its customers are investment-grade, and the firm hedges its limited commodity price exposure. The addition of Magellan's wide-moat refined product assets strengthens the business and opens up new investment opportunities by bundling different products across Oneok assets as well as batching, blending, and other storage opportunities.  Oneok's major growth opportunities in the near term lie in the Rockies and Williston Basin. Oneok's natural gas liquids volumes in the Rockies are around 391,000 barrels per day, well below its current capacity of 440,000 b/d (expandable to 540,000 b/d). Expected growth drivers are ongoing rig activity, ethane recovery, and reducing flared gas, and every 25,000 incremental b/d is about $100 million in incremental EBITDA. In the Williston Basin, there is also substantial upside for Oneok in terms of capturing now-flared gas, as Oneok has spare gathering and processing capacity and can benefit as rig activity in the area increases. Magellan will likely add new growth opportunities in the Permian, but also with hydrogen and renewable fuels.  While the Rockies have been the main earnings driver for a while, we think Oneoks capital investments are laying the groundwork for incremental growth beyond 2023. In particular, we are optimistic regarding Oneoks plans in Mexico, as it filed for a new pipeline to connect Oneok pipes at the U.S. and Mexican border, where a final investment decision is expected this year. Mexican gas demand growth has long been an attractive area. With recent regulatory and tax progress, midstream firms will finally enjoy a substantial uptick in earnings growth as pipelines fill up over the next few years. Peer TC Energy has projected its Mexican earnings to double over the next few years. ","We view Oneok as a narrow-moat corporation as it benefits from a strong efficient scale moat source. The acquisition of Magellan adds very high quality and wide-moat refined products assets to the business, but it is not material enough to move the entire business to a wide moat. Aftter the acquisition, the business mix will be natural gas liquids (44%), Magellan refined products assets (21%), gathering and processing (18%), natural gas pipeline (10%), and Magellans crude oil pipelines (7%). With the exception of the no-moat oil pipeline and gathering and processing assets (about one quarter of the business), we see the rest of the business as either narrow or wide moat. We expect Oneoks returns on invested capital to average 9%-10% over the next five yearswell above our cost of capital, easily supporting our narrow moat rating. Oneoks returns on capital have historically been among the best in our U.S. midstream coverage, matching up well with wide-moat Enterprise Products Partners and close to industry leader Magellan. The returns are despite the fact that Oneok operates with a narrower asset footprint than peers in the Rockies and midcontinent, but it has consistently found ways to deploy large amounts of capital relative to its size into its asset network at very attractive returns. However, it has yet to find a way to buy or build material amounts of natural gas liquids, or NGLs, exports capacity, which ultimately constrains the durability of its returns to a narrow versus a wide moat. The International Energy Agency projects in its stated policies scenario that global natural gas liquids demand will increase until 2050. U.S. natural gas liquids supply would be a material part of meeting that demand via export markets, as the U.S. has enjoyed a NGL feedstock cost advantage, thanks to low U.S. natural gas prices (natural gas liquids are a byproduct of gas production) for over a decade. Access to higher-priced export markets would materially extend its ability to earn returns above our cost of capital instead of being constrained to U.S. domestic markets and ceding fees to export terminal owners. Midstream moats are primarily earned via an efficient scale moat source. Efficient scale refers to situations where companies are effectively serving a very limited market size, and potential competitors have little incentive to enter the market because by doing so, they would lower the industrys returns to below the cost of capital. While the midstream industry is massive, individual companies connect a limited number of markets to one another. Therefore, the underlying routes they serve can each be considered individual, localized markets to which efficient scale applies. Even though low-cost shale oil and gas production in North America has grown rapidly, we've seen little evidence of speculative capacity additions with the majority of a pipelines takeaway capacity being contracted before starting construction, ensuring that new capacity is added in an efficient manner.Midstream markets exhibit several of the characteristics we look for in efficient scale markets. Demand for oil and gas products is growing slowly and should peak within the next decade or two, discouraging potential new entrants. Incremental demand can be met by incumbent companies at a very low cost, typically via compression, twinning a pipeline, or other means, making it difficult for new entrants to see a profitable investment opportunity. Demand is also fairly inelastic for oil and gas, meaning potential new entrants cant simply undercut existing operators on price to gain market entry. There are also significant barriers to entry in terms of multi-billion-dollar investments to build new pipelines and related investments as well as satisfying regulatory and other stakeholder concerns, which have only increased in recent years. Finally, exiting the market is extremely difficult, as assets can operate for decades safely with minimal maintenance investment, and repurposing older pipelines that may have low utilization for a higher and better use is a key skill set of good midstream management teams.New pipelines are typically constructed to allow shippers or producers to take advantage of large price differentials (basis differentials) between two market hubs because supply and demand is out of balance in both markets. Pipeline operators will enter into long-term contracts with shippers to recover the projects construction and development costs, in exchange for a reasonable tariff that allows a shipper to capture a profitable differential, and capacity will be added until it is no longer profitable to do so. Pipelines are approved by regulators only when there is an economic need, and pipeline development takes years. Regulatory oversight is provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and at the state and local levels, and new pipelines under consideration have to contend with onerous environmental and other permitting issues. A network of pipelines serving multiple end markets and supplied by multiple regions is typically more valuable than a scattered collection of assets. A pipeline network allows the midstream firm to optimize the flow of hydrocarbons across the system and capture geographic differentials; use storage facilities to capture price differentials over time; and direct more hydrocarbons through its system via storage and gathering and processing assets, ensuring security of flows and higher fees. The largest contributors to Oneoks operating margin are its natural gas liquids assets (44% of Oneok), which we see as narrow-moat assets. These assets primarily deliver NGLs from the Rockies and the midcontinent to the Gulf Coast and include both FERC- and non-FERC-regulated NGL gathering and distribution pipelines, NGL fractionation capacity (the second largest fractionator in the U.S., by our estimates), storage facilities, and truck and rail loading and unloading facilities. Its reasonable to expect much of the NGL supplied would come from Oneoks gas processing capacity in the same regions. Altogether, Oneok has connections to 90% of gas processing plants in the midcontinent, where its biggest strength is its exposure to the low-cost Permian Basin, STACK, and SCOOP plays. Oneoks network is deep enough in Texas and the midcontinent that it has options in terms of marketing NGLs in the midcontinent or moving them down to the Gulf Coast, depending on the widest differentials. We think Oneoks NGL assets are well positioned. We do consider fractionators to be higher-quality assets than natural gas and processing assets because of the more concentrated nature of the market. Gas processing plants typically only connect to a single NGL fractionation plant because it is uneconomic to have multiple connections, whereas shippers often have multiple options for gas gathering and processing. We estimate around 4.5 million-5 million b/d of fractionation capacity is in the United States. Given that NGL fractionation plants are between natural gas processing plants and refined NGL pipelines in the value chain, we think these investments are more likely to be sanctioned by a firm that owns all three parts of the chain versus an independent third party that will not be able to guarantee enough upstream and downstream supply to make the investment profitable. NGL contract coverage can be 7-10 years for new fractionation assets.Magellans refined product pipelines (21% of the business) are an extremely attractive business that has served as a reliable cash flow generator. The infrastructure is fundamentally better positioned than most if not all natural gas and oil pipelines for a few reasons. First, as the 9,800 miles of pipes across 15 states connects refineries to end markets such as gas stations via 54 Magellan terminals, demand is highly stable as it depends on consumer demand in terms of miles driven and fuel efficiency. Similarly, supply and thus flows are less volatile as it is aggregated by a refinery versus multiple gathering and processing units linked to levels of drilling activity. Second, with Magellan serving the midcontinent, which has benefited the most in recent years from an increase in light crude supply, Magellan serves some of the most profitable refineries in the United States, meaning it can easily boost prices 2%-3% annually in line with inflation with little pushback, as the costs are passed through to the end consumer. Third, wed characterize the incremental fee opportunities from refined product storage terminals and butane blending as low risk and attractive, given the lack of volatility in Magellans end markets. Finally, given the completely stagnant demand outlook, virtually no new pipes are being constructed, meaning Magellan faces no new competitive threats from that angle.The maturity and stability of the refined product market has lent itself to a niche where long-term contracts are less frequently used than in nearly all pipeline markets. Magellan only seeks long-term contracts when further investments are needed to ensure recovery of its capital, so only about 40% of its refined product shipments were subject to term commitments (usually involving reduced fees) with about three years until expiry. Given the refined products market is demand driven, customer credit is not usually relevant, as if one customer lowers utilization, another one steps in. With the market being demand driven and the high stability and security of pipeline flows and limited alternatives to Magellan pipelines, there is lower risk than average for Magellan. We see Oneoks gathering and processing business (18% of the firm) as no moat because of the lack of regulatory oversight, low capital intensity levels, and weak contract coverage. To be clear, we do think Oneoks gathering and processing portfolio is generally well positioned in low-cost basins across the midcontinent (STACK, SCOOP, and the Bakken) where the facilities remove contaminants and NGLs from raw natural gas for further processing and then recompress the residual natural gas for delivery to pipelines and end users. In general, we see G&P assets as useful in terms of controlling the direction and amount of flows into Oneoks pipelines. However, over 90% of Oneoks gathering and processing contracts include a percentage of proceeds component where Oneok hedges its exposure, but it exposes the firm to commodity prices. These contracts are very different than what Appalachian G&P peers obtain, which resembles fixed-fee contracts similar to those awarded to pipelines. In addition to the percentage of proceeds exposure, the corporation continues to be a fairly heavy user of acreage dedications for gathering and processing assets during the last few years (for example, over 3 million acres in the Williston Basin), which we see as supportive of long-term relationships with key producers. The size of the effort means the firm is more dependent on producers having the capital to deploy and the acreage being economic still versus working with an already established and producing set of wells. Producers typically have no shortage of G&P providers to pick from to meet their needs. Further, contracts are typically acreage dedication contracts that can last for 10-20 years but expose the G&P provider to both capital risk and changing basin economics. Given high well decline rates, theres constant investment required by the G&P provider to maintain and increase volumes, and if basin production peaks and declines, the G&P assets risk being stranded.We see Oneoks natural gas pipelines (10% of the firm) as narrow-moat assets, primarily because they tend to be weighted toward intrastate and thus subject to more light state regulation versus tougher FERC interstate regulation, meaning the barriers to entry are lower. The pipeline assets serve the midcontinent area (including STACK, SCOOP, Granite Wash, Woodford) and Texas (Permian Basin) and transport gas to end-use markets, but also export hubs in the Houston Ship Channel and Mexico. These pipelines are high quality, but were most intrigued by Oneoks recent joint ventures, which are the Northern Border pipeline and the Roadrunner. The Northern Border pipeline (50% owned by Oneok) transports gas from the Canadian border to Indiana. In recent years, Bakken gas has been displacing Canadian imports, and we expect this to continue. The Roadrunner pipeline transports gas from the Permian Basin on a fully subscribed 25-year contract to Mexico and when combined with Oneoks WesTex pipeline expansion positions Oneok to serve natural gas demand out of Mexico, where the national utility (Comision Federal de Electricidad) is retiring oil-fueled power plants. The biggest strengths of the network are that about 82% of its capacity serves end-use markets such as local natural gas distribution firms, electric generation facilities, and large industrial companies, meaning demand is highly stable. The business generated well over 90% of its revenue from firm contracts over the past five years, and utilization is typically 90%-plus. Magellans portfolio of crude oil pipelines and terminals (less than 10% of the new Oneok) is a no-moat business now, in our view. The most important asset is the Longhorn pipeline, which transports 275,000 bpd to Houston from the Permian Basin. Magellans other important crude oil assets are mainly joint venture activities, such as the BridgeTex pipeline (30% owned by Magellan), which transports 440,000 bpd to Houston from the Permian Basin, and Double Eagle (50% owned by Magellan), a 100,000 bpd pipeline that delivers Eagle Ford condensate to Magellans Corpus Christi terminal. These pipelines have taken sizable fee declines of more than 50% over the last few years with the Permian long-haul oil pipeline market expected to be oversupplied likely until the end of the decade. The pipelines are also not ideally located to serve export markets, which has contributed to utilization declining from the 90%+ levels they have historically earned. Magellan's major crude oil pipelines are largely contracted (75%-87%) under contracts that have an average remaining life of between four and seven years.Material ESG exposures create additional risk for midstream investors. In this industry, the most significant exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (from upstream extraction, midstream operations, and downstream consumption), other emissions, effluents, pipeline spills, and opposition and protests. In addition to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as production limits, removal of existing infrastructure, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions.Midstream emissions are relatively low in the lifecycle of oil and gas, and midstream firms have relatively lower risk than upstream and downstream firms from carbon taxes. Canadian firms already pay carbon taxes on their carbon emissions, most of which are generally passed to their shippers and other customers. Spills represent a major threat and have created great resistance from environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and other climate-conscious people. Examples of the opposition are seen in President Joe Bidens revocation of the Keystone XL presidential permit and the legal challenges surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline.Oneok is pursuing one of the more aggressive greenhouse emissions targets among its U.S. peers, aiming to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions (most peers target emissions intensity) by 30% by 2030. In contrast, Magellan has yet to lay out any material ESG targets.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Oneok is Medium. The single-greatest risk to the Oneok story is failure of international demand for natural gas liquids, particularly from China or India, to materialize. In addition to making up close to half of the partnerships gross operating margin today, Oneok's NGL business will serve as its primary growth engine through the rest of the decade as countries use more lighter olefins for heating and industrial end uses. However, much of this demand is out of Oneok's control. Any delays or reduced demand would have a materially negative effect on Oneok's earnings. Even as much of the downside risk is mitigated by sufficiently contracted capacity, failure of NGL demand to materialize would cap Oneok's earnings upside.Oneok holds some commodity price risk from volumes and equity ownership of natural gas and NGLs. The partnership addresses some of this risk through hedges and its diversified asset base. However, the main risk to Oneoks marketing business is a narrowing of spreads.As with many yield-oriented investments, Oneok is exposed to interest-rate risk. If interest rates increase faster than expected, Oneok's shares could underperform, as a steepening yield curve increases expected distribution yield for competing assets.Oneok's major ESG risks, in our view, are related to managing its carbon emissions profile at its carbon-intensive gathering and processing operations. If the United States were to introduce a national carbon tax or similar approach, this could increase costs for Oneok. Oneok also has exposure to community relations or social issues in terms of managing stakeholder relationships. For example, even though it holds no direct ownership in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, its assets are exposed to the loss of volumes.","We believe Oneok merits a Standard capital allocation rating. We think the company has generally pursued wise and somewhat outsize investments at attractive returns, which has resulted in fairly high leverage ratios historically, but they have declined as the projects have entered service and contributed to earnings. Oneok has also pursued a reasonable dividend approach and paused further dividend growth when it became clear that investors no longer valued the yield and payout. The investment in growth has come at a cost, though, as Oneok has yet to generate substantial excess cash flow to devote toward buybacks or materially higher dividends, and instead had to rely on EBITDA growth alone to reduce leverage. In contrast, peers have been active on this front for the past 24 months. Given the still-attractive returns, though, we think Oneok has managed to strike the right balance from a capital allocation perspective. Oneok management managed the balance sheet well during the latest energy market turmoil in 2020, issuing both debt and equity to shore up liquidity while slicing capital spending significantly. The firm maintained a very strong near-term liquidity profile, while concurrently placing a number of large and complex projects in service with no major issues. Leverage did decline fairly rapidly and was at a more reasonable 3.8 times at the end of 2022. The Magellan deal will keep leverage above 4 times until the end of 2024 by our estimates. Given the size of the transaction, we consider the Magellan purchase to be a relatively low-risk transaction, with modest incremental value creation initially, underpinned by highly secure tax benefits. Our model forecasts about $1.9 billion in net present value attached to tax benefits from 2025-27, slightly higher than Oneoks initial $1.5 billion estimate. The high degree of certainty around capturing these savings means that Oneok only needs to secure another $1.1 billion in value out of the deal via synergies (SG&A savings, capital avoidance, asset optimization, or new investment projects) to recover the $3 billion premium paid. Our model assumes about $100 million in SG&A savings (a bit more than 40% of Magellans existing SG&A spending). Oneok's 2018-20 investment of more than $8 billion was largely sensible and value-creating. We think highly of the well-planned Elk Creek and Arbuckle II pipelines in particular, given Texas' need for ethane molecules with several new Gulf Coast steam crackers in service. The G&P investment also addresses flaring issues in the Williston Basin, providing one of Oneok's best near-term growth opportunities. That said, not all of the earlier investments panned out. Oneok wrote off $257 million in 2014 and 2015 related to a coalbed methane natural gas gathering system in the Powder River Basin. The firm also impaired over $500 million in assets and goodwill in 2020 relating to natural gas processing and gathering assets in the Powder River Basin, western Oklahoma, and Kansas. Finally, the Oneok Partners transaction in 2017 was smart, as it eliminated the incentive distribution rights drag, lowered the combined corporation's cost of capital, and provided additional financial benefits in terms of a reasonable dividend growth pathway and a solidly investment-grade credit rating.","Oneok provides natural gas gathering, processing, storage, and transportation as well as natural gas liquids transportation and fractionation. It owns extensive assets in the midcontinent, Permian, and Rocky Mountain regions.","Oneok's financial health remains solid. The firm has a strong near-term liquidity profile with ample availability on its $2.5 billion credit facility. We expect leverage to have peaked in 2020 at over 5 times, and now should decline as EBITDA continues to increase. We model consolidated leverage at 3.3 times in 2025. Both Moody's and S&P affirmed investment-grade ratings recently. Oneok will need to be active in the capital markets regularly, with sizable annual maturities each year, but we don't expect any issues. Oneok benefits from lack of cash taxes for the foreseeable future due to a $14 billion tax basis step-up as a result of the Oneok Partners transaction. It has extended these benefits to 2027 from 2024 due to the Magellan deal, which we think is worth about $1.9 billion on a net present value basis. Given's Oneok's typically sizable capital budgets and already large dividend payout, we do not model any sizable dividend increases from the current $3.82 per share in the near term, though we think 1%-2% annual growth in reasonable in the near term. We expect the vast majority of incremental cash flows in 2023 and 2024 to be directed toward reducing leverage.

24/11/2023,Heightened Competition and New Product Introductions Weigh on Tandem Diabetes' Growth,Tandem Diabetes Care Inc,TNDM,4,02/11/2023,Debbie Wang,19.04,USD,23/11/2023,32.0,Very High,,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"Coming off the heels of a weak second quarter, Tandem's third quarter was more of the same. Though we made slight adjustments to our near-term expectations, this wasnt enough to affect our $32 fair value estimate. While Tandem has recently made progress in containing operating expenses, the firm still has some years to go before returning to profitability. Similarly, projected returns on invested capital are likely to trail the weighted cost of capital through 2027, which keeps us from awarding Tandem any sort of economic moat at this point. Tandem saw reported quarterly revenue fall 9% year over year, which accelerated from the low-single-digit decline seen in the second quarter. Further, the same pattern was seen in quarterly pump shipments, with third-quarter shipments down 24%, compared with the 8% decrease seen in the second quarter. We think several factors have been contributing to these results, some of which should ease over the next few quarters. For example, integrating t:slim X2 with Dexcoms new G7 and Abbotts Libre 2 continuous glucose monitors has taken time, and we often see patients hold off on purchases when they know that this kind of meaningful product feature is coming but not yet available. The integration with G7 should be widely available by the end of this year and a similar feature with Libre should be available early next year. This should tap some pent-up demand for t:slim X2 and its automated insulin delivery, or AID, system. Further, the rollout of the new Mobi pump should also help bring in new pump users in 2024, in addition to some existing t:slim X2 users who switch. We expect these factors to stabilize and return revenue to growth next year. We continue to think there is long-term potential for Tandem to attract pump users and, importantly, convert patients relying on multiple daily injections to move over to a pump with AID capability.","Tandems t:slim X2 features a low-profile, color touchscreen that is very user-friendly for patients new to insulin pumps.
 Tandem has bulked up its product pipeline with its smaller tubed t:slim Mobi, the tubeless Mobi, and the Sigi patch pump that is tubeless and can be adhered directly onto the body. Outside of the type 1 diabetes market, there are also significant opportunities for growth in the insulin-dependent type 2 patient pool.",Medtronic arguably enjoys more accurate and advanced algorithms thanks to its far larger patient user base and proprietary dataa major reason why it remains a step ahead of Tandem in closing the loop.  Tandem is still struggling to move into the black a decade after launching its first pump. Any potential breakthrough in gene therapy leading to the ability to enhance regeneration of islet cells and improve native pancreatic function could significantly hurt the market for insulin pumps.,04/08/2023,"Though Tandem Diabetes has made a splash in the insulin pump market as the latest entrant, the firm is still endeavoring to establish itself as a major competitor. On this rather lengthy path between the initial 2012 launch of its original t:slim pump and consistent positive earnings, Tandem still has a few years to go, from our perspective.  Similar to other pump makers, Tandem seeks to introduce new innovation every few years. On the whole, the firm has done a credible job of rolling out some meaningful improvements to its pumps over the last decade. In particular, it has made its pumps smaller and more discreet, incorporated a user-friendly color touchscreen, and integrated the pump function with continuous glucose monitors, or CGM, from Dexcom. However, the firms innovations have primarily kept pace with the competitive set and have less often leapfrogged ahead to offer the truly novel. For instance, Tandem launched its hybrid closed loop functionality in 2020, several years after market leader Medtronic launched its comparable pump in 2016. Keeping blood glucose in the healthy range is the first priority when choosing a pump, and individual usersespecially type 1 diabetes patients who need tighter controlmay find some pumps do an incrementally better job than others, which leads to an incentive to try out new pumps once insurance will pay for a new one (usually once every four years for durable pumps such as Tandems). Outside of blood glucose control, other features, including size of pump, alarm systems, tubed or tubeless, size of insulin reservoir, and CGM integration, can play into the brand choice. For Tandem, we think the user-friendly color touchscreen remains the key innovation that we think sets its pumps apart. With the acceptance of pump use rising, Tandem aims to develop additional products that leverage other features that users might prefera tubeless pump, the smaller Mobi pump for more active users, and a variety of infusion sets. With this robust pipeline, we think its likely Tandem can address a wider swath of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients over the longer term. ","Despite the solid commercial adoption of Tandems t:slim pump franchise, we think the firm has yet to dig an economic moat. The firm remains a distant third in the pump market where Medtronic has dominated through its ability to pioneer meaningful innovation, and Insulet has been able to attract a greater proportion of new pump users through its disposable, tubeless format. Tandem has demonstrated that it can generally offer comparable technology and nip at the heels of Medtronic, but it needs more time to enlarge its base of users such that the firm can become profitable. Different medical devices often enjoy high switching costs that provide a basis for economic profits over the long term. However, we think insulin pumps have not developed switching costs partially because users can measure how well their pumps keep their blood glucose within healthy ranges on a daily, and even near real-time, basis. In order to use an insulin pump, many patients (especially type 1 diabetes patients) pair it with a continuous glucose monitor to provide real-time readings on a smartphone or smartwatch. Current CGM systems also offer alarms that are triggered when blood glucose levels exceed or fall short of the healthy range at any time during the day or night. Thus, this reliance on CGMs offers patients a mechanism to constantly and objectively evaluate just how well the pump is controlling blood sugar. This ability to constantly grade pump performance and the fact that no pump can keep patients within healthy ranges all the time gives rise to users commonly switching between pump brands in a search to find one that works better. There is also nothing specific about the learning curve associated with pumps or the physical attachment to the body that gives rise to switching costs.Reimbursement policies typically will cover one durable pump every four years, which fails to impose financial switching costs that would get closer to the 10-year time frame of economic profits that wed expect to qualify for a narrow economic moat. At the end of the four-year period, users may also be interested in trying out some of the new innovations that have emerged since the purchase of the last pump. We think both of these dynamics contribute to the switching behavior that characterizes the pump market, even if reimbursement concerns may keep switching at bay during the four-year replacement cycle.Despite the lack of a moat now, we believe Tandem may have the seeds of intangible assets that might eventually develop into a moat. The firm holds patents in the U.S. as well as in other regions of the world. However, with insulin pumps and other engineered medical devices, competitors can often find ways to engineer another solution that sidesteps intellectual property boundaries. For example, we think a rival could also develop its own color touchscreen or a form factor to accommodate a smaller insulin reservoir without too much trouble. For this reason, we dont view intellectual property as a particularly strong shield against competition in the medical device market.Perhaps more importantly, Tandem has the potential to cultivate another intangible asset that is more defensible, in our view, through its collection of proprietary insulin pump data that is ultimately used to create more accurate and predictive algorithms that govern the automatic dosing of insulin. We contend that Medtronic, as the dominant pump leader, has already accumulated the most data since its pumps have been marketed since the mid-1990s, and we estimate significantly more type 1 diabetes patients have used Medtronics pumps over the years compared with Tandem and Insulet, which only entered the market in 2012 and 2005, respectively. We think this is a key reason why Medtronic has been able to consistently introduce new features that get the pumps function closer to that of a native pancreas ahead of competitorsincluding the latest advance in closing the loop to automate mealtime boluses.Nonetheless, if Tandem can continue to expand its base of pump users over time, we anticipate it could also use its collected data to improve its algorithms and enhance functionality to more closely resemble that of the pancreas.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we think Tandem faces the greatest risk in product governance. Defective or malfunctioning pumps can potentially lead to serious, acute conditions such as diabetic coma among type 1 patients. Poor patient outcomes can also arise from misuse of the device, and this means Tandem must invest in resources to help educate patients on appropriate use. Outside of product-related issues, Tandem may see human capital risks as the firm, similar to other medical device makers, needs to hire and retain skilled engineers.","We rate Tandems uncertainty as Very High, which reflects its reliance on concentrated products as well as its place in the relatively early stages of commercialization and the lengthy path to profitability that could be upset by competitors. Tandems greatest near-term risk is falling too far behind competitors on its technological advancements, which could slow its growth and place profitability even farther out. Considering how the pace of innovation has accelerated in pumps and continuous glucose monitors, this hurdle has become more challenging over the last seven years. This risk may be amplified if any rival were to introduce a pump that significantly improves how long blood glucose levels remain within a healthy range, or even if a competitor offers other differentiated and compelling features that can affect quality of life. For instance, Insulets recently launched integrated Omnipod 5 now provides hybrid closed-loop capabilities generally on-par with Tandems t:slim X2 with Control IQ, but it offers a substantially different wearer experience since it is tubeless and waterproof. As with other device makers, Tandem faces the risk of the potential product recalls and writedowns of inventory that becomes outdated. Considering Tandem has recently begun to make acquisitions, this also raises the possibility of integration risk and the potential of overpaying for external innovation.","We give Tandem a Standard capital allocation rating that reflects a relatively weak balance sheet more than offset by fair investments and appropriate distributions for its life phase. The 2025 maturity of Tandems $283 million in long-term debt in a time frame when the firm is still struggling to reach meaningful profitability and the related high operating leverage has weighed down the balance sheet assessment.However, this is balanced by fair investments that are characterized by strong strategic investments in expanding the firms patient user base, which should pay off over time as Tandem amasses more proprietary pump data that should help it develop more accurate algorithms that operate the pumps. The firm has most recently begun to engage in more acquisitive behavior to beef up its product pipeline with additional products that address different market niches, including a tubeless pump and a smaller, lower-profile pump. We think this approach makes strategic sense as rival Insulet has already garnered commercial success with its differentiated tubeless pump that holds significant appeal, especially to the pediatric market. With these products still in development, Tandem has yet to demonstrate that it can successfully develop technologies and shepherd them through the regulatory pathway to commercial adoption. Its too early to assess Tandems execution on these strategic moves, from our perspective.We think the firms shareholder distributions are appropriate for a business that is still in its early days of growth. At present, Tandem does not pay a dividend and hasnt made a practice of share repurchase. Instead, the company has been focused on investing in R&D and most recently, purchasing complementary technology to expand its product portfolio. Considering the pace of conversion to insulin pumps and the largely untapped type 2 market, wed be hard-pressed to suggest that reinvestment in the business should take a backseat to distributions to shareholders right now.","Tandem Diabetes designs, manufactures, and markets durable insulin pumps for diabetes patients. The firm first entered this market in 2012 and has since introduced multiple generations of pumps leading to its current t:slim X2 device. Nearly three quarters of total revenue is derived from the U.S., with the remainder primarily from other developed nations. The pumps themselves generate just over half of total sales, and another one third is from disposable infusion sets that need to be changed over every 2 to 3 days.","Despite operating in the red, we think Tandems financial footing is likely to remain solid through 2024 as cash and short-term investments of $576 million (as of December 2022) exceed convertible debt of $283 million. Additionally, the firm also has a $100 million line of credit that remains untapped. However, that convertible debt matures in 2025, and shares are currently trading far below the initial conversion price of $112.57. Management took further steps to minimize the risk of dilution by entering capped call transactions in 2020 that set the conversion price of these convertibles at $173.18. With shares currently trading in the 30s, we think its likely that Tandem will need to pay down this debt and potentially issue new debt or otherwise refinance to fund operations until the firm can turn the corner into profitability, which we expect in 2027.

25/11/2023,"Growthpoint's Funds Management Arm Unlikely to Grow Near Term, but Property Portfolio Looks Solid",Growthpoint Properties Australia,GOZ,5,05/10/2023,Alexander Prineas,2.27,AUD,24/11/2023,3.8,Medium,,Standard,,05/10/2023,"Our Growthpoint note, published Aug. 18, 2023, showed old forecasts from April 2023 that werent updated for fiscal 2023 results. This note corrects that error, and weve also amended some midcycle forecasts. Our latest forecasts include a more rapid increase in interest costs. We also remove some development income, given stubbornly high interest rates and elevated construction costs. After reflecting on this, we see a lower likelihood of profitable new projects on Growthpoints balance sheet, or in partnership with clients of Fortius, Growthpoints recently acquired funds management business. These negatives are partially offset by slightly improved rental growth assumptions, in part due to leases linked to the Consumer Price Index, which rose again based on numbers released in September. These changes result in estimated funds from operations by 2032 being 14% lower than our April estimates. However, the effect on valuation is neutral. The largest change to the earnings forecasts was interest costs, but our 6.5% estimated long-term cost of debt already factored in higher debt costs. Our fair value estimate remains AUD 3.80, with Growthpoint securities roughly 45% undervalued. No-moat Growthpoint Properties Australias fiscal 2023 result exceeded our expectations, though it was helped by income being pulled forward from future periods. Fiscal 2023 included one-off revenue from a large tenant ending a lease early, with almost two years of remaining rent paid out and recognized in fiscal 2023 but a corresponding vacancy in fiscal 2024 that needs to be filled. Funds from operations was AUD 26.8 cents per security (3% below fiscal 2022), and distributions totaled AUD 21.4 cps (up 3% on fiscal 2022). Guidance for fiscal 2024 is for FFO of AUD 22.5-AUD 23.1 cps and distributions totaling AUD 19.3 cps. Our fiscal 2024 FFO estimate remains 22.9 cps, 15% lower than 2023 due to interest-rate rises, and the vacancy left behind by the departing tenant.","Growthpoints portfolio is mostly secondary locations that could see population growth and ongoing development push them to higher and better uses, increasing their value.  Demand for good-quality Australian real estate from the likes of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other offshore investors is likely to remain despite higher interest rates.  Growthpoint trades meaningfully below net tangible assets. The discount could narrow if interest rates rise less than the market fears. ","Capitalization rates remain low and haven't yet reflected the large rise in market interest rates. When they do, it could put pressure on property valuations. Growthpoint's secondary assets could be hard-hit in a recession or in a structural fall in property demand, such as from hybrid working or from artificial intelligence contributing to declining white-collar employment. Office and industrial property benefited from several years of tight supply, and rents increased dramatically. Office is in pain now and industrial could cool off, too. ",05/10/2023,"Growthpoint Properties Australia generates about two thirds of its rental income from office property and one third from industrial property. Its market capitalization is small, a fraction the size of heavyweights Dexus and GPT. The REIT's property portfolio is mainly composed of smaller assets in secondary locations, but long leases and a combination of luck and savvy investment decisions allowed it to sidestep major impacts from the pandemic. About 20% of the office portfolio is located in Melbourne's central business district fringe or suburbs. The groups major recent office development project, Botanicca 3, is in Melbournes Richmond and was completed in early 2020, initially with no tenants. The building was predominantly leased over the course of 2021 via agreements with major tenant Bunnings. Queensland and New South Wales each make up about one fourth of the portfolio each, mostly fringe or non-CBD locations such as Sydneys Parramatta and Olympic Park. While planners want to decentralize Sydney, it remains to be seen how successful this will be. About half of Growthpoints industrial portfolio is composed of four distribution centers leased to Woolworths. Growthpoint paid to develop one of these sites, but Woolworths guaranteed a return of 6.75% on the development costs. In return, Growthpoint agreed to an early surrender of Woolworths lease on another site at Broadmeadows. This was a savvy move as it allowed Growthpoint to sell the vacant Broadmeadows site at a time when demand for industrial property remained solid. Woolworths has a significant lease expiry in fiscal 2026. However, Growthpoint management noted that Woolworths typically takes four to five years to plan a large move, and there was no evidence of such a move yet. We think this is reasonable, and our base case is that Woolworths renews. ","The majority of Growthpoints property portfolio is in CBD fringe or suburban locations. We do not assign a moat to the business due to the ease with which new supply can be added in these areas and the low barriers to tenants switching to other similar areas. Supply in these areas is less constrained, and we do not believe properties in these areas have maintainable competitive advantages. Suburban and CBD fringe locations have fewer geographical impediments to new supply and building heights are lower, which means space can be created by building upward and outward. The non-CBD market is fragmented and competitive, with a wide range of landlords owning property. Even if particular locations face supply bottlenecks, tenants considering non-CBD locations have many alternatives, which makes it difficult for landlords to keep exerting pricing power. Offices in the Sydney CBD achieved rental growth of more than 60% over the five years to 2019 due to the lack of space. However, new supply and tepid demand due to hybrid working caused rents to drop substantially during the pandemic. We expect a gradual rebound, but so far the recovery has been sluggish. We note Growthpoints substantial exposure to fringe areas of Brisbane, a market which can be volatile and heavily exposed to tourism and mining. Brisbane experienced significant falls in tenant demand when the resources boom ended but has been an area of strength in 2023.Though not uniform, offices outside the CBD have a higher proportion of tenants with lower-quality business models on average. Non-CBD sites can experience longer vacancies when tenants depart and in some cases require more substantial refurbishment or development to attract new tenants. Growthpoints weighted-average-lease-expiry of about six years implies modest renewal risk given a moderate amount of new office supply is on the way in Sydney and Melbourne. There is also the risk of tenant defaults in a recession, in the midst of an environment where reletting property in secondary locations would be challenging. That said, Growthpoint's tenant profile is fairly strong.Within the subset of non-CBD office property Growthpoint has some sites that are above-average quality and with some strong tenants locked into long leases. But in the long run, we assume Growthpoints property portfolio will deliver returns in line with the cost of capital. ","We assign Growthpoint a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Growthpoint typically limits real estate development risk. Given the Australian REIT is majority owned by Growthpoint of South Africa, we believe the portfolio is likely to remain focused on Australia and unlikely to stray into large overseas investments or major developments, because the South African parent can achieve those aims through other entities. The major risks we see for Growthpoint are that its properties are in more marginal locations, and it targets high gearing. Pro forma gearing (net debt/assets) was 37.2% at June 30 2023. That's at the low end of the trusts target of 35%-45%, but we believe that range is high considering the mix of properties in secondary locations, and risks of interest-rate rises, inflation, and uncertain office demand in the wake of hybrid working. This risk is mitigated to a degree by leases, with a weighted average expiry of over six years. The protection from a lease is only as strong as the tenant. Reassuringly, nearly a third of rent comes from government tenants such as the NSW Police, where we think the probability of default is near zero. About another third of office rent comes from corporates we consider relatively secure, such as Bunnings, Woolworths, Bank of Queensland, and Samsung. Beyond that, there is exposure to tenants that are well known brands that operate in riskier areas such as discretionary retail, for example Country Road. Exposure to discretionary retail businesses means that Growthpoint could have substantial downside risk in a prolonged recession or a structural downshift in office demand.","We assign Growthpoint a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating, based on its sound balance sheet, fair investment strategy, and appropriate securityholder distributions. The REIT maintained reasonably high leverage through the property bull market up to 2019, which was accretive for shareholder value, but was higher risk, particularly given some of Growthpoint's fringe locations. However, the REIT presciently took steps to reduce leverage as the cycle became long in the tooth. From June 30, 2019, to Dec. 31, 2020, gearing was reduced from 34.3% to 31.4%. With the onset of the pandemic in the following year, risk was further trimmed, and by June 30, 2021, gearing was 27.9%. We view these as prudent decisions. When the pandemic hit, Growthpoint had solid tenants locked into long leases across the majority of its portfolio, meaning that the high leverage was manageable. We view the current rise in leverage as imprudent given risks of inflation, interest rates and office demand, but at least gearing remains at the low end of the REIT's high target range of 35%-45%.We view the group's investment strategy as fair. A blemish on the record was the speculative development of Botanicca 3, which completed just prior to the onset of the pandemic and was 100% vacant on completion. While the pandemic was impossible to predict far in advance, signs existed for some years that the office market was heated. To Growthpoint's credit, Botanicca 3 was completed well before a stream of rival supply in Melbourne was scheduled over the course of 2021 and 2022, helping it to tenant the majority of the building by June 2021. Bunnings signed as a major tenant in the asset in 2020, albeit it won some flexible lease terms, and we believe it would have received a notable rent discount given market conditions at the time.We view securityholder distributions as appropriate overall. At times Growthpoint has paid out more than its adjusted funds from operations, funding the shortfall with debt, which we believed was unmaintainable. The group reduced distributions in 2020 citing a more conservative approach going forward. The group raised capital via a share issue in 2019, taking advantage of strong, and in our opinion overvalued, equity markets. Overall, we believe decisions made by the Growthpoint management team are supportive of shareholder value creation in the context of an above-average risk profile within the sector. ","Growthpoint Properties is an internally managed Australian REIT, with commercial property investments split circa 65/35 between Australian office and industrial assets. Historically the REIT did not undertake funds management activities but it purchased fund manager Fortius in September 2022. The REIT usually limits speculative property development, though it built an office development in suburban Melbourne. The asset was completely vacant on completion, but Growthpoint was able to attract tenants and it is now occupied. ","Growthpoint is in reasonable financial health, but there are risks. Gearing (net debt/assets) was 37.2% at June 30. This is at the low end of the groups target of 35%-45%. Without further actions from management, gearing could go much higher if asset values continue to fall due to interest-rate rises. There is a preponderance of secondary property assets in the portfolio, and meaningful new office and industrial supply is arriving in Sydney and Melbourne. There is a risk Growthpoint may need to sell assets or raise equity. Reassuringly the group's debt expiries are well staggered. Two thirds of debt is interest-rate hedged with an average maturity of 2.9 years. As hedges roll off, Growthpoints interest coverage ratio of 3.4 times will likely deteriorate. But the hedging means Growthpoint shouldnt be fully exposed to market interest rates until 2026. Its current cost of debt is 4.6%, which is not too far below our estimated long-term cost of debt of 6.5%. Overall, the headwinds from rising interest costs shouldnt be as severe for Growthpoint as some of its more heavily leveraged rivals. Overall, while Growthpoints business strategy is vanilla, we consider it a higher-risk REIT due to its secondary portfolio and elevated gearing. While parent Growthpoint of South Africa is a strategic shareholder of Growthpoint in Australia, there is always the possibility that the shareholding could be reduced, which could put short-term pressure on the share price of the Australian entity. The South African parent has historically run a gearing ratio of about about one third, and apart from its Australian exposure it has invested in Poland, Romania, and South Africa and made a large acquisition in the U.K. in late 2019. Stress in these markets, for example, could prompt the South African parent to sell its Australian equity in a stressed scenario.

24/11/2023,"Margin Recovery Slower Than Expected, but Ramsay's Long-Term Outlook Largely Unchanged",Ramsay Health Care Ltd,RHC,4,13/11/2023,Shane Ponraj,49.51,AUD,24/11/2023,68.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,,13/11/2023,"Ramsay Health Care has agreed to sell Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care to Columbia Asia Healthcare for MYR 6 billion, or approximately AUD 2 billion. Ramsay expects the NPAT on the sale of its share of the joint venture, after transaction costs, to be approximately AUD 630 million. This compares with our estimated enterprise value of over AUD 20 billion for Ramsay Health Care. Ramsay Sime Darby is a 50/50 joint venture in Asia between Ramsay Health Care and Sime Darby Holdings Berhad that has operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. We view the offer as value neutral for Ramsay and maintain our AUD 68 fair value estimate. Although the deal is still subject to the receipt of regulatory approval from Australias Foreign Investment Board, we assume the sale will be finalized by the end of third-quarter fiscal 2024 and remove our share of profit from Ramsays joint venture from then onward. Ramsays share of Ramsay Sime Darby earnings contributed just AUD 20 million in fiscal 2023, or 1% of Ramsays group EBIT, and we expect it to remain similarly negligible over our explicit five-year forecast period. We think a sale of Ramsays operations in Asia is strategically sound given the adequate price achieved and opportunities in Ramsays main geographies. In addition, the sale provides welcome relief to Ramsays balance sheet. We expect Ramsay will use the majority of proceeds to pay down drawn debt and now forecast net debt/EBITDA to be below 2.5 by fiscal 2024 end as guided to by management.","Ramsay is entrenched as the market share leader in Australia, which contributes the bulk of group earnings and remains an attractive market, given relatively stable participation in private health insurance. Coronavirus pressures are largely temporary in nature, and Ramsay is well positioned once volumes and mix normalise. Increased investment in the Australian development pipeline and digital overseas is strategically sound and strengthens Ramsays moat.","Elevated safety costs and staffing challenges are lingering with continued coronavirus surges. Recovery in volume, particularly higher-margin nonsurgical services, is likely to be protracted given lower overall urgency and patient hesitancy. Group ROICs including goodwill have significantly declined following European acquisitions and currently sit below the 7% weighted average cost of capital.",13/11/2023,"Ramsays Australian business enabled its global acquisitions, but the market fundamentals offshore are far less attractive. The key differentiator is the proportion of private health insurance, or PHI, coverage of the population. According to data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, 45% of the Australian population have PHI resulting in roughly 80% of Ramsays Australian revenue flowing from PHI versus 20% or less in its other geographies. This has a direct impact on profits earned as providers are price-takers in publicly outsourced work. Ramsay has been willing to divest, selling the German business in fiscal 2021, and we would support further exits in countries where the firm doesnt have critical mass. Holding a large market share within regions provides negotiating power with payers and cost advantages from scale, but we think the benefits of being a global operator are limited due to varying regulatory regimes and most costs being staffing. Despite pandemic pressures weighing on Ramsay, the firm is increasing its capital expenditure to better position itself for long-term growth. The key areas of investment are brownfield and greenfield expansions in Australia, and digital overseas. We are positive about the Australian development pipeline as it strengthens Ramsays cost advantages derived from scale, typically pays back in three to four years, and is low risk as demand in the area is already established. Ramsay is focusing on increasing its day surgery capacity as the proportion of day surgeries at Australian private hospitals has increased to roughly 65% from 60% in the last 10 years. The firm also sees opportunity for integrated care and higher-margin nonsurgical ancillary services such as rehabilitation and mental health. Ramsay is also strategic by adding doctors consulting rooms to hospital sites which encourages higher usage of on-site operating theatres. Relationships with referring physicians is key and Ramsay is reliant on maintaining its reputation for quality of care and modern facilities. The focus on digitisation in Europe is also strategic given synergies from integrating IT are relatively easy to capture. ","Ramsay is Australias leading private hospital provider, and we award it a narrow moat rating based on cost advantages provided by negotiating power and scale. Ramsay has superior negotiating power in setting pricing with private health insurers, who ought to keep Ramsay in their product offering to remain compelling to customers. Scale-based cost advantages also contribute to better than peer operating margins. We believe that a moat only exists in the Australian segment because of the 80% private health insurance revenue contribution, as compared with 20% or less in its other geographic regions.Ramsay has roughly 30% market share of the private hospital market in Australia, and geographic positioning skewed to urban and mid- to high-income areas that would be difficult to replicate. Payer negotiations are done on a network basis and for three-year terms. With significant and growing market share, we think Ramsay can negotiate better rates with key health insurers as they cannot afford to exclude Ramsay hospitals from their offering. Ramsays negotiating power is not a pure function of scale, but also factors its reputation for high quality care and established network of medical specialists. In a published member survey by PHI provider, Medibank, five of the top 10 rated hospitals are operated by Ramsay highlighting its expertise. Ramsay has extended its scale in Australia, with revenue growth averaging 6.4% over the last 10 years versus private hospital benefits market growth averaging 5.4%, as patients, physicians and payers increasingly seek out Ramsays services.Ramsay Australias operating margin is observably above its peers. Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data, private hospitals averaged an operating margin of 10.7% between 2014 and 2017 versus Ramsays 13.0% over the same period. Ramsays underlying operating margin further improved to 15.0% in prepandemic fiscal 2019 from 13.8% in fiscal 2017, and we think this is a function of both negotiating power and some scale-driven cost advantages. While the latter is difficult to quantify, we assume higher patient admissions allow for labour, equipment, IT and overhead costs to be leveraged, and Ramsay to hold a relative advantage over subscale providers.The high proportion of publicly funded revenue in its overseas segments makes Ramsay a price-taker and precludes it from earning a moat rating for these regions. Contracts are mostly tender based with annual tariffs dictated by government agencies. While the operating net asset base of individual segments are undisclosed, the lower operating margins and significant operating lease commitments in Ramsays overseas segments lead us to believe that returns on invested capital are lower than in Australia.Nevertheless, at a group level Ramsay has reliably posted an average ROIC excluding goodwill of 11% over the last 10 years, due to its significant Australian market share and associated cost advantages. We estimate the company to earn a ROIC excluding goodwill of 9% on average over our five-year explicit forecast period, exceeding its weighted average cost of capital of 7%. We exclude goodwill, mostly acquired from Ramsay Sante, to not penalise the group for expensive one-off acquisitions made overseas in 2014 and 2018. However, even including goodwill, Ramsay averaged a ROIC of 9% prepandemic , and forecast to again settle above WACC from fiscal 2025 onward as the company recovers from the pandemic. While ROICs have likely been diluted by geographies dominated by publicly funded healthcare, the strength of the core Australian business which contributes the bulk of attributable profit, make us comfortable applying the narrow moat rating to the group. We do not factor further acquisitions given Ramsay significantly lifted its planned capital expenditure to grow organically. However, should the company continue to seek acquisitions overseas, and Australia cease to contribute the majority of group earnings, we would reassess Ramsays moat.","We assign a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. While the industry is defensive, it remains hard to predict Ramsays path of recovery due to COVID-19. In Australia, regulatory risk is low, Ramsay owns most of its properties and key payer negotiations are for three-year terms. However, Ramsays other regions are more prone to regulatory pricing risk due to higher exposure to publicly funded care, and this compounds with committed lease costs.The primary ESG risk relates to product governance where consistent medical errors could lead to widespread failure in providing quality care. Hospitals require licenses or accreditation to operate, and loss thereof would cause financial and reputational damage. However, Ramsays well-established processes have kept re-admission rates and adverse events at low levels across its global network, and we dont think this is likely to deteriorate materially. Ramsays hospitals conduct energy intensive activities such as laundry, medical equipment use and food service. Climate change regulations and volatility in energy prices will affect Ramsay but are unlikely to lead to material value destruction. The firm continually reduces its energy use and indirect carbon emissions per patient, with initiatives such as installing solar power, upgrading its heating and cooling systems, and diverting more of its waste to recycling.Failure to recruit or retain staff may also affect patient admission rates. The industry faces staffing challenges due to mandated vaccination and pandemic-induced fatigue, but we think this is likely to be temporary given the undeniable need for healthcare. Understaffing or employee overtime may also result in increased lapses in safety or quality of care. Ramsays collection and storage of sensitive patient data introduces another ESG risk. Failure to secure and protect private data from theft or misuse could lead to patient liability claims but we think one-off fines or extra compliance costs would be immaterial.","We assign Ramsay an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on our assessment of balance sheet risk, investment efficacy, and shareholder distribution.Ramsays balance sheet is in sound condition. Financial risk is low given low revenue cyclicality and solid cash conversion. Assuming no significant acquisitions, we forecast Ramsays net debt/EBITDA to average under 2.0 times on a pre-AASB 16 basis over the five-year explicit forecast period, while also funding its planned increase in capital expenditure and maintaining a 50% dividend payout ratio.Investment efficacy is exceptional. While Ramsays past European acquisitions have been dilutive to ROICs, the strategy for increased brownfield development in Australia and higher investment in digital overseas makes sense for shareholders and is likely to help to expand ROICs including goodwill back above its WACC of 7% by fiscal 2025 onward. We are positive about the strategy of directing increased capital to brownfield expansion in Australia, which strengthens its cost advantages derived from scale, typically pays back in three to four years, and is low risk as demand in the area is already established. The focus on digitisation in Europe is also positive given IT costs are relatively easier to leverage. Although dilutive to ROICs, we credit Ramsay Sante for its successful operational execution and integration of Capio AB in 2018, realising more than its EUR 20 million target in synergies. The company targets 15% EBIT return on capital expenditure deployed.Shareholder distributions which have typically averaged around 50% of underlying net income are appropriate. Ramsay has maintained a consistent payout ratio while also funding its growth and maintaining its leading market positions. ","Ramsay Health Care is one of the largest private healthcare providers in the world, with over 460 facilities across 10 countries. The key markets in which it operates are Australia, France, the U.K., and Sweden. It is the largest private hospital group in each of these markets except for the U.K. where it ranks fifth. Ramsay Sante, which operates the European regions other than the U.K., is a 52.5%-owned subsidiary of Ramsay Health Care. The company typically earns about 60% of consolidated earnings in Australia and 30% in France. Ramsay Health Care undertakes both private and publicly funded healthcare.","Leverage is elevated at 3.2 at June 2023 pre-AASB 16. We forecast this to be the peak and leverage will fall to 2.2 by fiscal 2028 year-end. As Ramsay Australia owns most of its properties, the group has extra optionality if ever capital constrained.While free cash flow conversion of earnings averaged 95% over the five years to fiscal 2019, it was boosted in fiscal 2020 due to the French government prefunding all outsourced work which contributed to a working capital inflow of AUD 526 million. We forecast cash conversion to be depressed over the next few years as returns on new capital deployed are not yet realised. However, our cash conversion at midcycle is 86%, and we forecast Ramsay to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 65% which is broadly consistent with the historical average. The dividend is largely underpinned by the Australian business.The capital structure includes AUD 252 million of convertible adjustable-rate equity securities, on which Ramsay pays a fully franked dividend equivalent to a margin of 4.85% over the 180-day bank bill swap rate after tax which is high in the current funding environment. The CARES funding is not material in terms of the capital structure of the business overall, but it is unclear to us why the securities were allowed to step up to this high rate rather than being refinanced given the availability of cheaper debt. Review of the largest CARES holders doesnt reveal any material related parties.",RHC.AX,Healthcare,11077122048.0,ASX,505864.0,AUD,49.52999877929688,True,1,51.6648732327931,51.24269773901585,1
24/11/2023,Acquisition of Sprint Wireline Brings Incremental Opportunity and Should Benefit Cogent,Cogent Communications Holdings Inc,CCOI,3,10/11/2023,Matthew Dolgin,65.94,USD,23/11/2023,70.0,Medium,Narrow,Exemplary,C,10/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Cogent Communications' reported third-quarter results convey little meaning, as the firm is working through its very atypical acquisition of the Sprint wireline business from T-Mobile. Cogent has completely integrated the Sprint wireline financials into its results. Now it is quickly shedding a sizable portion of the $500 million in annual Sprint revenue it acquired, as much of this business is unprofitable and bleeding cash, which is why Cogent is receiving $700 million over the next four years to take on the albatross. For the next several quarters at least, investors will have to parse managements commentary more than the quarterly results. Our long-term view, which is not nearly as enthusiastic as managements regarding potential sales growth, is unchanged, as is our $70 fair value estimate. Under any circumstance, we believe the netcentric business remains the growth engine for Cogent. Traffic on the network, which should be unaffected by the mid-second-quarter timing of the Sprint deal, grew 6% sequentially, a very strong seasonal result. Management said netcentric growth trends remain strong, as they are largely driven by growth in streaming video around the globe. In addition, we expect netcentric to be the biggest beneficiary, from a sales standpoint, from the Sprint acquisition. Management is excited about its newfound ability to sell wavelength, which mostly falls into the netcentric category. The firm had $3 million in wavelength revenue during the quarter, but it's quickly building out its capacity to meet demand and expects $20 million in wavelength sales by the second quarter of 2024, on its way to a $100 million annual run rate by the end of the year. However, even if wavelength sales reach these levels, we expect the rest of the Sprint revenue to remain in gradual decline, which is why we dont expect high sales growth for Cogent throughout our forecast.","Unburdened by legacy services or networks, Cogent can capitalize on the latest technologies without realizing excessive costs or cannibalizing more lucrative revenue streams. Cogent's low-cost structure, a byproduct of how it built its network, leaves other firms unable to profitably compete on pricing for comparable services. The cash infusion from taking on the legacy Sprint wireline business far exceeds the near-term losses that it will produce. The physical network Cogent received solidifies the cost advantage in its core business.","Deflationary pricing for internet transit, where Cogent is a market leader, will lead to diminishing profits on that business. A secular shift away from urban office buildings sparked by COVID-19 would be very detrimental for Cogent, as two thirds of its revenue is from corporate customers taking connections in those buildings. Cogent is tiny compared with its main competitors, which include the biggest telecom companies in North America. Those competitors' scale advantages will eventually enable them to undercut Cogent's prices for comparable services.",10/11/2023,"Cogent provides internet and private network connections for enterprises, and it carries internet traffic for internet service providers, content producers, and other websites. Both businesses face challenges as technological advancements allow those functions to be performed at lower cost, but we think Cogent's strategy leaves it positioned to succeed.  Cogent's advantages arose from its leased, low-cost, internet-specific network and the opportunistic buying it did to form its network. Rather than building a network itself by putting fiber into the ground, which we think often fails to justify the steep expense due to oversupply in many geographies, Cogent signed long-term leases to procure the rights. We think that advantage can persist now that Cogent has taken over the Sprint wireline network from T-Mobile. When combined with a network architecture that was optimized for the internet and a lack of legacy products to support, Cogent is in a superior position to most competitors, including major telecom companies. Cogent's network connects to more than 1,800 high-rise buildings in North America. It serves enterprise customers in those buildings only, as its model would not be profitable in less dense areas. Enterprises typically seek connections for both internet service and private networks. Private networks have evolved significantly in recent years, as firms can use internet-based, virtual solutions rather than more expensive legacy products. This shift is shrinking the market, but Cogent's lack of legacy offerings leaves it with more opportunity rather than the shrinking prospects of the industry. Internet transit is a small addressable marketabout $1.5 billion, according to Cogentand rapid price deflation mutes market growth despite the huge increases in data consumption. The small market has driven some competitors away and likely will keep others at bay, as they wouldn't be able to compete without an existing low-cost network like Cogent has.","We believe Cogent has a narrow moat based on a cost advantage, which stems both from a smart and fortuitous compilation of its physical network, which consists of about 100,000 route miles of fiber (roughly 60% intercity and 40% metro), and from the technology and equipment that the firm uses to light the network. Cogent decided from its inception to construct a network solely to accommodate internet communication, which has increasingly become the preferred mode of communication versus the more expensive and less efficient services that legacy telephone and cable companies provide. With that vision, Cogent began putting together a network two decades ago for far less cost than we believe a firm could today, and its singular focus on internet communication results in lower operating costs as well.In our view, Cogent's biggest advantage is the relatively low capital outlay that was required to put together its underlying network, which the firm says is the most interconnected network in the world, connecting to nearly 7,000 other networks (30 are settlement-free peers, while the remainder are customers) and carrying more than 20% of the world's internet traffic. Cogent also has over 1,800 skyscrapers on its network in North America, where it connects corporate customers. Rather than building the network itself, Cogent put together its network by leasing indefeasible rights of use, or IRUs, from network owners for unused, or dark, fiber. It enhanced its network shortly after the tech and telecom bubble burst at the beginning of the century, when, for a few hundred million dollars, it was able to lease capacity from or acquire financially distressed companies that had invested billions of dollars building networks. Cogent's IRUs have an average remaining life of around 20 years and come from over 200 different network suppliers. As a result, Cogent's capital spending now consists primarily of maintenance costs and equipment upgrades, and its capital intensity is materially lower than competitors. Capital spending as a percentage of sales has been 10% or less each of the last five years and is generally declining, as equipment pricing is often deflationary. This advantage has led to a relatively low invested capital base, especially since the accounting lives (for depreciation purposes) of many assets are shorter than the actual useful lives.Beyond the physical footprint, Cogent's network architecture leads to an operating expense cost advantage. Cogent runs a homogenous network, built exclusively to offer internet connections and carry the traffic over its network. Cogent's competitors typically provide multiple services to enterprises, including voice, and use legacy technologies, such as MPLS-based VPNs (multiprotocol label switching-based virtual private networks). Internet-based technologies and software solutions are replacing those services and causing those markets to dramatically shrink. Legacy networks also face more costs to accommodate the explosion in volume that is accompanying internet use (transit bit volume has been growing 25% annually for the last 25 years), and given the deflationary pricing environment for internet transit, competitors have been leaving, rather than entering the transit business. Cogent's more focused product portfolio results in a lower operating cost structure and a leaner back office, and without legacy products or technologies, Cogent can more easily adopt new and cheaper technology. Competitors' disadvantages do not stem solely from legacy networks; they are a product of their differing business models. According to Cogent, internet transit is only a $1.5 billion total market, and internet-based enterprise services are a $9 billion market, compared with tens of billions for voice and MPLS services. Legacy competitors must build their networks with an eye toward optimizing the bulk of their businesses, whereas Cogent can focus exclusively on carrying internet traffic. We think traditional carriers are unlikely to undertake significant spending to eliminate Cogent's cost advantage on businesses that for them are declining dramatically and where the total addressable markets are relatively small. Further, Cogent has indicated that its business model is only economical in the densest areas (about 10% of rentable office space), so we think legacy carriers are more likely to put their resources into the 90% of offices where they face less competition.With that backdrop, it might seem likely that competitors that are unburdened by legacy networks could more readily replicate Cogents business, but we believe that leads back to the favorable terms Cogent originally secured for its network. With a $1.5 billion addressable internet transit market that is not likely to grow much, since price deflation has typically offset traffic growth, and an enterprise market that is geographically dispersed and shrinking due to technological advances, we think it would be too expensive for new competitors to cobble together economical networks today. They would not have the advantage Cogent had 20 years ago, when top providers in a more nascent internet business were phone and cable companies, and fiber assets could be procured on the cheap due to the collapse of the tech and telecom bubble.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Cogent is Medium. Changes in technology and a permanent shift in office worker attendance could cause headwinds, but as a leading firm carrying internet traffic, Cogent should see much of its business exhibit stable growth.We expect Cogent to be immune from many of the challenges that could befall owners of corporate office buildings, but theres still risk related to permanently fewer corporate offices and the manner in which office workers work. In a perfect storm, there would be a reduced need for connections, particularly for VPNs. If the work-from-home phenomenon keeps buildings that Cogent connects more vacant than we expect, the company would face even greater challenges. About 55% of Cogents sales stem from providing internet and private connections for corporate customers in urban high-rise buildings, and we project significant growth opportunities with those customers. A widespread reduction in that market would materially alter our sales forecast.In our view, Cogents biggest environmental, social, and governance risk is that of a data or security breach, given that the firm is one of the biggest internet transit providers in the world and runs corporate networks, resulting in individuals and corporations most sensitive information in its care. While we think the risk of a monumental breach is low, the financial and reputational damage that could result from a severe security breach could be devastating, especially if it were due to company negligence.We believe another risk for Cogent is the level of dependence it has on founder and CEO Dave Schaeffer and its seeming lack of a succession plan. We attribute much of the firm's success to Schaeffer and think the stock would suffer if he left.","We assign Cogent an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, driven by what we see as an exceptional philosophy regarding shareholder distributions and a historically very smart investment strategy. We also take into account the shape of Cogents balance sheet and outlook for investments.Cogent has modestly raised its dividend every quarter for more than 10 years, leading to 15% average annual dividend growth since 2015. The dividend has accounted for over 100% of free cash flow for the past several years, so we dont think the company should raise it any more aggressively, but with low reinvestment needs, we dont think its problematic. The component we like best about managements shareholder distribution policy is how it handles share buybacks, typically engaging in them significantly when the stock is depressed and laying off after periods of significant appreciation. The firm spent $60 million on share repurchases in 2008 during the Great Recession and has not exceeded that level since. It came closest in 2014 and 2015, when the market experienced downturns. The firm repurchased virtually no shares in 2018 or 2019, when the stock was going straight up, but began repurchasing shares again in the second half of 2020, when the stock was down over 30% from its highs. We think management has created significant shareholder value through its discerning attitude toward share repurchases, and we expect that to continue.Management has handled acquisitions in a similar manner, creating significant value to shareholders over the years by buying only opportunistically. Cogent bought 13 companies in the wake of the telecom bubble from 2001 through 2004. It also nearly doubled the size of its network footprint from the end of 2007 to 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, after the size of its footprint had been steady since 2004. Apart from those periods of industry distress, Cogent has acquired almost nothing, as it didnt see accretive opportunities. In 2023, Cogent acquired Sprints wireline business from T-Mobile and will receive $700 million over the next four to five years for doing so. We believe the cash Cogent will receive more than offsets the declining portion of that business, making it another shrewd move. We think shareholders are served well by managements judgment and will continue to benefit if attractive opportunities arise.","Cogent carries over one fifth of the world's internet traffic over its network and is a broadband provider for businesses. Cogent's corporate customers are in high-rise office buildings; the firm provides them with two types of connections: dedicated internet access, which connects them to the internet, and virtual private networking, which offers an internal network for employees in different locations. Cogent's corporate customers are exclusively in North America and account for over half of the firm's revenue. Cogent's netcentric customers include internet service providers and content providers, to which Cogent provides internet transit. They hand traffic to Cogent in data centers and rely on Cogent to deliver it. About half of netcentric revenue is from outside the U.S.","Cogents leverage ratio has ticked up the past few years, but the firm maintains a large cash position and doesnt have any debt maturing until 2026. Our biggest cash concern is that if business doesnt pick up, Cogent may need to put a stop to the quarterly dividend increases that it has implemented each quarter for more than 10 years.At the end of 2022, Cogent had $275 million in cash and $1.25 billion in debt, including $300 million in capital leases. Of the nearly $1 billion in borrowings, about half matures in 2026, and half matures 2027. Cogents net debt/EBITDA ratio, including the capital leases, was 4.0 at the end of 2022.Cogent has recently been returning more than 100% of its free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) to shareholders via its regular dividend. A payout ratio above 100% is not maintainable long term, but we don't think the dividend is in danger unless business severely deteriorates.We think Cogent has the flexibility to acquire assets, but we don't expect it to do so unless the market presents an opportunity. History says the firm will be patient when assessing its options, and it is not averse to maintaining a sizable cash balance.",CCOI,Communication Services,3182427648.0,NMS,364312.0,USD,65.94000244140625,True,0,63.26789088529412,71.69540329921234,1
24/11/2023,SoftBank Group Still Quite Cautious but Eyeing Suitable AI Investments,SoftBank Group Corp,9984,4,14/11/2023,Dan Baker,6228.0,JPY,24/11/2023,7100.0,High,,Standard,C,14/11/2023,"SoftBank was quite cautious regarding new investments in second-quarter fiscal 2023 (quarter ended September 2023) with total investments from the parent company, Vision Funds, and LatAm funds of USD 1.2 billion in the quarter down from USD 1.8 billion in the first quarter but up from the USD 0.5 billion per quarter over the last three quarters of fiscal 2022. The company reported a net loss of JPY 931 billion in the second quarter, mainly due to a net loss on investments of JPY 264 billion and a foreign exchange loss of JPY 183 billion. A weaker Japanese yen increased SoftBanks net asset value, or NAV, by JPY 0.6 trillion in the second quarter, which was the main reason for the increase in NAV to JPY 16.4 trillion at the end of September 2023 from JPY 15.5 trillion at the end of June 2023, along with increased share prices of its investments. We retain our SoftBank fair value estimate at JPY 7,100 and see it as undervalued at the current share price. We had carried WeWork at zero value since its failed listing and our lowered value for ARM was offset by increased SoftBank Corp valuation and currency movements. SoftBanks leverage increased over the second quarter with loan-to-value under SoftBanks calculation method that excludes asset-backed finance moving from 8.0% at the end of June 2023 to 10.6% at the end of September 2023. This continues to be well below the companys self-imposed ceiling of 25% in normal times, so the company has plenty of cash to invest. Note, if we include asset-backed financing and hybrids and the full value of the assets, we see that the adjusted LTV has actually increased marginally from 36.5% to 37.8% over the quarter. We believe this is a better measure of the true leverage and implies that much of the apparent leverage reduction over the quarter was in fact an increase in use of asset-backed financing and hybrids from JPY 6.95 trillion at end-June 2023 to JPY 7.67 trillion at end-September 2023.","With the vast array of internet and e-commerce investments that SoftBank owns, it could unearth more investments that, like Alibaba, offer very high returns. Masayoshi Son has an excellent track record of building value and expanding the company. An investment in SoftBank offers minority shareholders an opportunity to invest alongside him. Investors focused heavily on the troubles in the Vision Fund in 2019 and 2022, but most of the company's value lies in listed stakes in high-quality businesses.","The SoftBank Vision Funds may struggle when the tech market is in a downturn and the IPO market is shut.  SoftBank may spend a lot trying unsuccessfully to find another Alibaba. The company will continue to make big bets, as evidenced by the Sprint takeover and the offer for ARM Holdings. The SoftBank Vision Fund makes SoftBank's accounts more complicated and opaque.",14/11/2023,"As a telecom and technology investment company, SoftBank Group represents a unique investment opportunity. The current portfolio is a mix of internet and technology investments with a stake in a developed-market mobile services business. Internet and artificial intelligence are the two main themes likely to underpin most investments in the future. The company can invest in public and private markets both directly and through is Vision Funds that invest in mostly pre-IPO technology companies. Management is looking to close the gap between a plausible sum-of-the-parts valuation and its share price through asset sales and repurchases of its own stock. If the Vision Funds perform well it may argue for a premium valuation, but performance in fiscal 2022 was very poor. In fiscal 2020 the company closed transactions to sell most of its stake in T-Mobile (postmerger with its Sprint business), as well as a 24% stake in its Japanese domestic telecom business, SoftBank Corp. Over the three years to fiscal 2022 it has also monetized practically all of its Alibaba stake. We expect the 40%-owned SoftBank Corp. to remain a strong cash generator in a mobile market with three incumbent operators. While Rakuten's entry has caused a few bouts of pricing pressure, we beleive Rakuten will need to stem the cash outflow from the telecom business and may not be in a possition to spark price wars in the future. The SoftBank Corp business is important as the major dividend-paying investment for SoftBank.  SoftBank completed a successful IPO of ARM in September at USD 51 per share, having sold 9.4% of ARM and raising USD 4.8 billion for SoftBank. Morningstar covers ARM, and we give it a wide moat underpinned by switching costs and intangible assets. Most investment in Vision Funds was put on hold in fiscal 2022, but select investments in artificial intelligence may be considered in fiscal 2023, given it does not want to miss out on investment opportunities arising out of the tremendous progress made in this field over the past year.  ","Given the increase in deal activity in what were previously seen as core businesses for SoftBank, we rate SoftBank as an investment holding company rather than an operating company, and thus rate it as no-moat. While the weighted average moat weighting of the companies currently in the companys portfolio would point toward a narrow moat company, we no longer have confidence that SoftBank will continue to hold these companies over a 10-year period. The deal activity in its key assets that tipped the balance for us included: 1) The IPO and sell-down of the core Japanese telecom business. SoftBank sold around 36% of its shares of the core domestic telecom business, with the proceeds being used for investment, debt paydown and a share buy back. It also sold down a further 24% of this business in 2020. 2) The merger of Sprint with T-Mobile, which lowered SoftBanks stake in the U.S. telecom business from 85% to 24%. It has subsequently sold most of this stake. 3) The transfer of a 25% stake in ARM Holdings to the SoftBank Vision Fund. In a presentation in early 2018, the CEO explained that his long-term corporate strategy is to structure SoftBank as a SoftBank synergy group, with many associate companies with a target ownership level of 20%-30%. He explained that these companies would not necessarily carry the SoftBank name, so it would be easier to exit the stake if one of the companies were to fall back to number two or three in their given market. Greater than 50% ownership of core companies is possible, but the idea is that SoftBank Group would be a strategic holding company. With the company morphing this way, we believe we should rate SoftBank as an investment holding company rather than an operating company.For investment holding company moats, we assess whether the investments are being run by the management team as an operating entity, or if the investment is passive and purely a buy/sell type of investment. We also look at the type of holdings (whether they are fairly random, or if we see a strategy behind the deals) and the holding periods. The best case for a narrow moat is a conglomerate that invests using an easily understood overarching strategy, holds 100% of its companies versus minority stakes, holds for the long run, and is an active operator in its business. While most of SoftBanks investments are in the technology space and are potentially disruptive in nature, SoftBank will control only very few of them, and we are no longer confident that the company will hold them for the long run. Owning less than 50% stakes makes it very difficult to be an active operator of most of these businesses. The firms strategy has changed over the past three decades, from a PC software distributor, to a mobile phone operator, to an internet incubator.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for SoftBank is High.We believed the biggest risk for SoftBank was in turning around Sprint, its U.S. mobile business, on a maintainable basis but the merger with T-Mobile closed this out. While there are still integration risks with the merger, SoftBank has now sold out its position in this business so these risks are neutralized. While investing in early stage internet and e-commerce companies is inherently risky, the number of investments undertaken by SoftBank at least spreads this risk. However, as we saw over fiscal 2019 and again in fiscal 2022, the value of these can fall quickly with a major economic downturnin this case driven by a global pandemic virus outbreak. With the almost complete investment of SoftBank Vision Fund 1, SoftBank has seen a larger proportion of its value tied up in unlisted companies, which may introduce disclosure risks for SoftBank investors. The failed WeWork IPO in 2019 is a good example of this whereby IPO disclosures exposed corporate governance issues that investors were not aware of.Rakuten's entry into the Japanese mobile market in April 2020 provides some risk to the incumbents if it can gain the confidence of Japanese customers in its network and Rakuten can continue to fund the startup losses. There is also some risk in the Vision Fund should tech valuations decline sharply, especially given the leverage in the fund due to the preferred equity. In 2021 the Chinese government tightened regulations around internet companies which hurt the valuation of many of these companies and with 20%-25% of SoftBank Vision Fund's assets in this market, plus a significant company investment in Alibaba, this poses a risk for SoftBank. ","We assess the capital allocation of SoftBank Group as Standard. Founder Masayoshi Son is chairman and CEO and has built up the company from a distributor of packaged software in 1981 to a company with a market cap that has risen above $120 billion at various times. This was done through a series of aggressive and overall largely successful investmentsmost famously investing JPY 7.4 billion in Alibaba in 2000 for a 34% stake, which it subsequently monetized for JPY 9.7 trillion, equating to a 57% IRR from 2000 to May 11, 2023. This track record alone could arguably be worth an exceptional investment rating and has been company defining. The purchase of the SoftBank domestic mobile business from Vodafone has also been a success turning a JPY 1.8 trillion investment into a business worth over JPY 9 trillion at the end of March 2020. However, the investment in WeWork, which totaled around $10 billion, has also not been a successful one to date. SoftBank boasts three major positives in its investment track recordAlibaba, Yahoo Japan, and the SoftBank domestic telecom businessalong with a few disappointments so far in WeWork and Brightstar, with a watchful eye on ARM that had a successful IPO in 2023 but we value at USD 34 per share, materially below the USD 51 IPO price. The company also successfully launched the $100 billion Softbank Vision Fund and while its initial investment performance was positive, the performance soured in fiscal 2019 leading to SoftBank failing to attract external investors into SoftBank Vision Fund 2. For SoftBank Vision Funds 1 and 2, from inception to end-March 2023, SoftBank's net blended IRR was minus 11%, as was its IRR for the LatAm Funds. We believe the track record is too mixed to assign an Exceptional investment rating.We believe SoftBank Groups balance sheet is sound. Given its corporate structure, we see traditional balance sheet analysis as somewhat irrelevant given T-Mobile is not consolidated and while SoftBank Corp. is consolidated, its debt is ring fenced for SoftBank Group following the IPO. One way that the company measures its financial position is the loan/value ratio (net debt/equity value of holdings) which stood at 11% at March 2022. The company's target is to keep this value below 25% in normal times with an upper threshold of 35% in times of emergency so we see the current balance sheet as sound. However, if we include asset-backed financing and the full value of the assets, we see that the adjusted LTV was 36.4% at March 2023. An even more conservative measure would be to add debt in self-financing entities. This debt is nonrecourse to SoftBank Group, but gives a measure of leverage over the underlying assets taking into account how leveraged those entities are. Under this measure the loan/fair value was 49.6% at the end of June 2023.The company has a regular dividend policy of paying JPY 22 per share in the first and third quarters of each financial year, which we see as token given it amounts to an average dividend payout ratio of only 6% over the past 10 years. We believe investors in SoftBank are not buying shares for dividends but are really backing the company, and Mr Son in particular, to invest in growth based private companies and public shares in the Artificial Intelligence space. In addition to the dividends SoftBank Group also participates in opportunistic buybacks as it sees fit with money spend on buybacks around two and a half times as much as the dividend repayments although the majority of this was spent in fiscal 2021. Management publishes its view on the net asset value of its portfolio which has tended to be well above the share price, with the share price trading at between 35%-65% of the companys value estimate from mid-2019 to end-2022. We would expect the company to continually evaluate whether to buy back its own stock or to invest other AI opportunities based on expected return profile with further buybacks likely when the share price is trading below 50% of the companys valuation. ","SoftBank is a Japan-based telecom and e-commerce conglomerate that has expanded mainly through acquisitions, and its key assets include a 40%-owned mobile and fixed broadband telecom operator business in Japan. It also owns 90% of semiconductor chip designer ARM Holdings following the 2023 IPO of this business, and has a vast portfolio of mainly internet- and e-commerce-focused early stage investments. It is also general partner of the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund 1 and sole investor in SoftBank Vision Fund 2, both of which primarily invest in pre-IPO internet companies.","SoftBanks leverage increased over second-quarter 2023 with loan-to-value under SoftBanks calculation method which excludes asset backed finance moving from 8.0% at the end of June 2023 to 10.6% at the end of September 2023.

Under this measure, the end-June loan to fair value of 47.8% decreased from 49.6% at the beginning of the quarter, as self-financing entities decreased net debt to JPY 4.7 trillion from JPY 5.8 trillion over the quarter. This was due to net debt reduction at SoftBank Corp., SVF1 and SVF2. The company has a regular dividend policy of paying JPY 22 per share in the first and third quarters of each financial year, and it also participates in opportunistic buybacks as it sees fit. Over the five-year period from fiscal 2018 until end-fiscal 2022, the company had repurchased JPY 4.5 trillion of its own stock, as its stock price has traded at an average of around 50% of its own sum-of-the-parts valuation over the June 2019-March 2023 period.",9984.T,Communication Services,8576398524416.0,JPX,5928400.0,JPY,6228.0,True,1,6412.380472322784,7112.9937512361585,1
25/11/2023,Effective Cost Control and Robust Output Growth to Underpin CNOOCs Earnings,CNOOC Ltd,00883,4,24/10/2023,Chokwai Lee,12.86,HKD,24/11/2023,18.0,High,,Standard,,24/10/2023,"CNOOC's cumulative nine months 2023 net profit was down 10.2% year on year to CNY 97.6 billion, largely in line with the Refinitiv consensus. The impact of lower energy prices was partly offset by stronger output and stringent cost control. After incorporating our latest energy price and foreign exchange assumptions, we raise our 2024-25 earnings estimates by 6%-19%. Our fair value estimates of HKD 18.00 per H-share (CNY 16.60 per A-share) remain intact as our long-term Brent forecast of USD 60 per barrel is unchanged. We think CNOOCs H-shares are currently undervalued, with estimated 2024 dividend yield of more than 10%, based on the Oct. 24 closing price. The firm remains our top pick in the sector, given its cost efficiency and robust production growth. CNOOC's strong output growth and low all-in cost continue to stand out. The firms cumulative nine months oil and gas output rose 8.3% year over year to 499.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, or mmboe. We now expect CNOOC to produce about 663.5 million boe in 2023, slightly above the firms target output of 650-660 mmboe. Meanwhile, cumulative nine months all-in cost was 6.3% lower year on year to USD 28.37 per barrel due to lower taxes and operating expense. Although this was partly aided by the depreciation of the Chinese yuan, this reaffirms managements capability in cost control. We expect CNOOC to keep its average all-in cost at around USD 30 in our explicit five-year forecast periods. Cumulative nine months capital expenditure rose 30.2% year over year to CNY 89.5 billion, and management raised full-year target to between CNY 120 billion to CNY 130 billion, from CNY 100 billion to CNY 110 billion, previously. The higher spending is mainly due to faster projects approvals and accelerated capacity expansion. We believe this will support CNOOCs reserves and production growth. CNOOC will provide more information on its future output target in the 2024 strategy preview in January next year.","With purely upstream activities, CNOOC's fair value estimate and earnings would benefit significantly from a rise in oil prices and/or output. The company has been effectively lowering costs and it remains one of the most efficient offshore oil producers.  The Chinese government awarded CNOOC exclusive drilling rights for the entire South China Sea, which holds great potential for oil and gas reserves.","The state-owned nature of CNOOC places national interests above investors' interests. Potential sanctions imposed by the U.S. may negatively affect CNOOCs earnings growth. The Chinese government could fumble the rebalancing process of its economy, which would lead to lower economic growth, lower oil demand, and consequently, lower oil prices.",24/10/2023,"CNOOC is the upstream arm of China's third state-owned oil company, China National Offshore Oil. As a result, it's the most direct option for investors seeking exposure to China's energy security policy and long-term plans to increase its oil supply. As it does not have downstream activities, the company has also avoided a large legacy labor force. None of the company's sales are subject to government price controls. CNOOC also represents China's rights to potentially lucrative offshore reserves in the South China Sea and it enables CNOOC to avoid costly exploration expenses. However, an increasing share of its own independent activities and assets outside China have raised CNOOC's all-in costs since 2008. That said, the company has been successfully cutting costs since 2014 during the low oil price environment. Going forward, we think CNOOC will keep its average all-in cost at around USD 30 per barrel in our explicit five-year forecast periods given the firms track record in containing costs. Domestic conventional crude oil and gas remain crucial to CNOOC's profitability. The Bohai Bay operation is the company's most important asset, making up 39% and 8% of crude oil and gas production respectively, and 28% of total reserves in 2022. Owing to managements efforts to maintain the annual reserve replacement ratio at more than 100%, CNOOCs reserve life stayed around 10 years during 2017-22 despite rising production. We expect CNOOC to continue investing in exploration activities, as well as scouting for high-quality oil and gas assets globally. CNOOC has access to financing from Chinese state-owned banks and an ability to tap cross-border bond markets, so it benefits from access to low-cost debt.","We think CNOOC will continue to benefit from holding exclusive rights from the PRC government to enter into production-sharing contracts, or PSCs, which results in relatively low costs to CNOOC, as it doesn't have to incur expensive exploration expenses. However, we assign a no-moat rating to the firm as its cost advantage alone is not sufficient to consistently deliver return on invested capital, or ROIC, above its weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. For example, over the past few years, the firms ROICs were below its WACC during low oil price environments such as 2015-17 and 2020.Given the oil price volatility of the last decade, the emergence of U.S. light tight oilwhich acts as the global marginal supplier that can quickly ramp up or downand the uncertainty of demand (coronavirus fallout, work-from-home impact, electric vehicle penetration, and so on), we think it is reasonable to expect similar volatility during the next decade. This does not imply prices can only fall. To be sure, the fallout from currently low prices is also industry underinvestment that could ultimately result in a global shortage and much higher prices than our midcycle USD 60/bbl assumption for Brent. Regardless, however, the excess returns we forecast for CNOOC at our midcycle price are too narrow to instill the necessary confidence they can endure through the cycle in a variety of price environments, hence our no-moat rating.In addition, CNOOC's reserve life is barely above our preferred threshold of 10 years, during 2017-22. A series of discoveries in offshore China, where cost is lowest for CNOOC given its PSC arrangements, is possible to extend its reserve life but this is difficult for us to factor in with certainty.Material environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, exposures also create additional risks for oil and gas producers, including carbon emissions in their operations, use of their products, and emissions, effluents, and waste generated in operations. In particular, the risk from carbon emissions is most likely to materialize through some form of carbon pricing, which can increase the price of end products to consumers and reduce demand for oil and gas over time. In addition, the ongoing low-carbon trends (such as gradual transition to lower-emitting fuels) could eventually lower demand for oil and gas. We expect carbon taxes to gain greater adoption over time but think the impact on hydrocarbon demand remains more than a decade away.We note that Chinas three national oil companies (CNOOC, PetroChina and Sinopec) are trying to manage these risks through low-carbon business strategies, such as focusing more on gas production, renewable energy, and alternative fuels such as hydrogen. However, details remain scant on these strategies and there is no evidence that the low-carbon businesses will grow meaningfully in the near term. Furthermore, as China is a net importer of oil and gas, we think it will be challenging for the three national oil companies to significantly cut exposures rapidly, given their roles in the countrys energy security.","We have a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High for CNOOC. As an oil and gas producer, CNOOC remains exposed to commodity price volatility that may significantly affect earnings. In addition, the sanctions by the U.S. government may impair the firms ability to access U.S. goods and technology such as equipment and services supply for offshore development. This could lead to delays in projects and negatively affect earnings.The company's exclusive right to enter into production-sharing agreements with foreign companies is a considerable advantage when operating in offshore China. As part of compliance for admittance to the World Trade Organization, China has been loosening restrictions that favor Chinese firms. Competition from outside companies could infringe Chinese firms' domination over the Chinese energy markets. If these rights are revoked or granted to other Chinese firms, it would diminish CNOOCs prospects to increase production and reserves over time. International expansion exposes the firm to geopolitical risk not associated with its offshore China operations.CNOOCs parent company is one of the primary importers of liquefied natural gas into China in 2022. However, selling prices of natural gas for residential use in China are set by the government at levels that could potentially produce negative margins. If the parent were to drop down these assets to CNOOC, the firms operating margins would take a substantial hit.We think CNOOC's key environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks (captured in our Uncertainty Rating) include carbon emissions in its operations, use of its products, and emissions, effluents, and waste generated in operations. For example, oil spills at Bohai Bay in 2011 resulted in large penalties, while the ongoing low-carbon trends could eventually lower demand for oil and gas.","We rate CNOOC's Capital Allocation actions as Standard. The company's ultimate mission is to serve Chinese society, with shareholder wealth creation being an ancillary benefit. CNOOC's management team has benefited from working with foreign oil companies for many years on offshore projects. The executives took the knowledge gained from these experiences and applied it to their own independent operations. Despite their experience, the Chinese government ultimately makes decisions via its control of CNOOC. While China has moved to a more open, free-market-based economy in recent years, decisions regarding natural resources and the companies that control them are often made with the national good in mind. In such cases, shareholders' interests and China's interests may not necessarily be aligned.Returns on investment capital fell below the firm's cost of capital in 2015-17 due to weak oil prices, but management was prudent during this period, making effective cuts to costs and capital expenditure and reducing loss-making production. We note that management has employed the same strategy to counter the impact of the oil price collapse in 2020.CNOOC maintains a stable and liquid balance sheet in order to retain flexibility. This has enabled the firm to withstand the previous downcycle in the oil and gas industry. Its EBITDA covered its interest expense by 43 times in 2022. The balance sheet strength also allows the firm to continue to pay dividends during an industry downturn. The firm pledged to maintain a minimum annual payout ratio of 40% for 2022-24, with annual absolute dividend of at least HKD 0.70 per share for 2022-24. CNOOC has also initiated a share buyback program in 2022 to improve shareholder returns. We are positive on these moves as it shows that management is working hard to improve the firms valuation and a clear dividend policy also helps to boost investor confidence.In the longer term, CNOOC intends to transform itself into a low-carbon company and the firm plans to invest an additional 5% to 10% of its annual capital expenditure in the new energy sector, such as offshore wind power business. We will monitor the execution of the strategy as the firm is still relatively new in this sector.","CNOOC is Chinas main offshore oil and gas exploration and production company. Through its parent company, it has exclusive rights to partner with foreign companies in offshore China projects. Production for 2022 averaged 1.71 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (78.5% oil), and year-end proven reserves were 6.24 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or boe, (73.8% oil). Assets outside China make up around 30.6% of production.","CNOOC, like many of the oil and gas majors, maintains a stable and liquid balance sheet in order to retain flexibility. The firm's adjusted EBITDA covered its interest expense by 43 times in 2022 with net cash position as at end-2022. CNOOC has generated healthy free cash flow in the past, benefiting from its high-quality assets and low-cost operations. We expect this trend to continue.",0883.HK,Energy,639075155968.0,HKG,77723550.0,HKD,12.979999542236328,True,1,12.93104208521446,14.450370305853085,1
24/11/2023,Nemetschek Has Moaty Software Products With Strong Structural Growth Drivers,Nemetschek SE,NEM,2,27/10/2023,Rob Hales,81.28,EUR,23/11/2023,54.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,,27/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Nemetschek delivered solid results in the third quarter. While the company beat the FactSet consensus on revenue and EBITDA and raised 2023 guidance, we surmise this was broadly in line with market expectations as shares traded flat on the day. We are currently updating our model for the latest developments but do not anticipate a material change to our EUR 54 fair value estimate. At current levels, the shares look moderately overvalued. Guidance for 2023 revenue was increased and the EBITDA margin was specified. Nemetschek now expects constant-currency revenue growth to be 6%-8% compared with 4%-6% previously. Furthermore, the EBITDA margin is now expected to be at the upper end of the previously communicated range of 28%-30%. Prior to the quarter, we were forecasting revenue growth of 5% and an EBITDA margin of 28% for 2023. The market response to the third-quarter beat may have been muted due to some temporary effects. Specifically, in addition to favorable operational developments, strong growth in the third quarter was attributed to catch-up effects from the second quarter as well as one-off effects in the design and build segments. The design and build segments both benefited from stronger-than-planned license sales. Overall, the companys strategy of shifting the distribution model to subscription and software-as-a-service from perpetual licenses is progressing well. Third-quarter subscription/SaaS constant-currency revenue growth was 49% and constant-currency annual recurring revenue growth was 25%. Furthermore, recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 75% from 65% last year and the EBITDA margin was a healthy 32.5%.",Nemetscheks cash flow stream should become more predictable and resilient as recurring revenue increases with the transition of customers to subscriptions and SaaS. The company is benefiting from strong structural growth drivers such as the very low level of digitalization in the construction industry. Harmonization of the company's disparate software brands should lead to increased opportunities to cross-sell and operational efficiencies.,"Nemetschek depends on acquisitions to meet its growth targets. The lack of suitable targets may lead to a disappointing performance. The companys transition to a subscription-based delivery model will likely lead to diminished financial performance in the near term. The majority of the companys revenue depends on the health of the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation industry, which is cyclical and is particularly sensitive to higher interest rates.",27/09/2023,"Nemetschek, based in Germany, is a leader in the software market for the architecture, engineering, construction, and building operations industry. The companys software helps architects and other construction professionals plan, design, and manage construction projects, as well as collaborate with others more efficiently. Nemetschek is also active in the software market for the media and entertainment industry, where its flagship product Maxon is a leader in 3D animation.  The companys primary strategic goal is to increase recurring revenue by shifting the majority of its customer base from perpetual software licenses to a subscription and software-as-a-service delivery model by 2025. This may dampen growth and profitability modestly over the next two years, but ultimately the business will be more predictable and resilient with better opportunities for cross-selling and upselling.  Nemetschek has historically been highly exposed to Europe, but it is striving to diversify its revenue base geographically. Around half of revenue is still generated in Europe, with Germany accounting for a significant share, but the mix should continue to shift toward the Americas and Asia-Pacific over time.  The company developed its original product, Allplan, in the 1980s. Allplan is building information modeling software that enables architects to create 3D models of buildings and other structures. Since then the company has expanded, mainly through acquisition, to offer over a dozen software products. Acquisitions should continue to play an important role in its growth strategy. While Nemetscheks software brands have historically operated independently in a decentralized manner, the company is now seeking to harmonize its operations to improve efficiency and drive opportunities for cross-selling.  Nemetschek is targeting revenue growth of 4%-6% in constant currencies in 2023 before returning to double-digit growth in 2024-25. In 2024, recurring revenue is expected to account for 85% of the total revenue and the EBITDA margin is expected to be above 30%. ","We think Nemetschek has a narrow moat based on switching costs. The companys return on invested capital, including goodwill, is currently in the midteens and we expect this to remain relatively stable in our forecast. Nemetschek has four segments in which we see different moats based on the strength of switching costs: design (wide moat), build (narrow moat), manage (no moat), and media (narrow moat). The companys customer retention rate is typically above 95% overall, with the design and media segments being a bit higher and the build-and-manage segment being a bit lower. At a high level, Nemetschek operates in two software sectors: architecture, engineering, construction, and operation of building and infrastructure projects, and also media and entertainment. Both of these software markets are highly fragmented in total, but there are many niches within these markets that are highly concentrated and Nemetschek has leading products in some of these niches. In the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation software market, Nemetschek segments its business in line with the building lifecycle, that is plan and design (design segment), build and construct (build segment), and manage and operate (manage segment).We think the design segment has a wide moat based on switching costs. Design is the companys original business and remains the largest by revenue with the most software brands. The key brands in the segment are Allplan, Graphisoft, and Vectorworks, which are business information modeling software products that mainly target architects and engineers who design buildings and other structures. BIM software enables users to create detailed 3D models of the buildings and infrastructure they are designing. The market for BIM software is concentrated. Autodesk is the market leader by far with an estimated market share in the high-30% range. Nemetschek and Bentley Systems have around 10% market share and Trimble has a market share in the high single digits. Together, these top four companies control around 65% of the market. A meaningful new competitor has not emerged in this market for at least a decade. Design software is very complex. An excellent understanding of the construction process is necessary to create this type of software as every project is unique and every country has different regulations that are very strict. Strict regulations lead to risk-aversion as the cost of failure is very high. Consider the consequences of a building that collapses due to faulty measurements. Evidence of the complexity of the product is seen in the reseller market. Resellers typically only sell one product. This type of software is mission-critical for architects and engineers as it is the core tool they spend most of their working hours using, like an Excel spreadsheet for a chartered financial analyst. The learning curve is steep, which requires a significant investment in time for users who typically would need several months to become proficient. Once a user has become comfortable with the software, they have little motivation to switch as it would completely disrupt their workflow and likely prevent them from taking on any new projects for several months and thus lose sales. To take advantage of this tendency, Nemetschek partners with universities to give undergraduates its software products for free so they can learn how to use them and thus develop an early attachment. Last, the cost of the product is not meaningful enough to incentivize users to switch. Under the perpetual license model, the upfront cost per user is approximately EUR 3,000-EUR 5,000 with annual maintenance costs around EUR 800 per user. Considering the maintenance costs compared with the salary of an architect or engineer, the cost is insignificant given the software is the users main working tool, leaving little incentive to switch after the investment in licenses. In the newer subscription model, the annual cost is roughly EUR 1,000-EUR 1,500 per user. At the margin, we surmise this is slightly negative for switching costs given there is no longer a need to make the upfront investment in a license. However, we still think the cost is relatively immaterial and the above-mentioned factors of time investment, complexity, mission-critical nature, and high cost of failure trump the effect of upfront license lock-ins for switching costs. We think the build segment has a narrow moat based on switching costs. In the total build and construct software market, Nemetschek has a market share of around 7% and the top seven players control around 45% of the market with Procore, Oracle, and Trimble being some of the larger players. However, the build-and-construct software market is composed of numerous niches that are often dominated by one company. For example, Nemetscheks Bluebeam software, which comprises the lions share of sales in the build segment, is the dominant software solution in the drawing management niche. Currently, there is no competitor to Bluebeam, its essentially the Google of drawing management. Accordingly, we think switching costs are based on its status as the industry standard and the associated lack of viable alternatives. We dont think Bluebeam has a wide moat because it is a relatively simple program (PDF-based markup and collaboration) that is easy to learn and lacks concerns in the design segment around regulations and safety. Software in the build-and-construct market is simpler in general, which means it is more open to new entrants. For example, Procore is a relatively new entrant, which has grown quickly to become a leader in the office-field connection niche. In the long term, we think competition will increase as leading companies begin to step into adjacent niches as they try to create more of a platform solution covering multiple niches. However, we dont expect this to play out in the next decade given the expected strong growth in the market and the current low penetration of software means that companies can focus on untapped customers rather than trying to grab market share from other players.We dont think the manage segment has a moat. The manage segment, which provides software solutions for property and facility management, is the newest and smallest business for Nemetschek. The company estimates its market share is 1%. Currently, it is reporting very low margins, which means it is most likely not earning its cost of capital. While we expect performance to improve, we are not confident that higher returns are necessarily maintainable over a decade-long time horizon. We think the media segment has a narrow moat based on switching costs. Nemetscheks flagship product, Maxon, is primarily targeted at creative professionals who use it for 3D animation. While market share is difficult to estimate, Nemetschek asserts it is a leader in this market. Major competitors include Autodesk and Foundry. Currently, this segment has the highest margins (more than 40% EBITDA margin) and is clearly outearning its cost of capital by a wide margin. We think Maxon has some of the similar switching costs that are found in the design segment. Specifically, Maxon is a complex product that takes several months of learning to become proficient in. It is mission-critical as it is the core tool for users for most of their working hours. Once proficiency is obtained, users are very hesitant to switch to a competing product given familiarity and the disruption it would cause to the workflow. However, we are not confident of a wide moat given the market appears to be more open for competition as it is newer and there is not the same kind of risk-aversion that occurs in the design segment due to regulations and the high cost of failure.","We assign Nemetschek a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. As Nemetschek primarily serves the construction industry, the company is exposed to the cyclicality of its customers. However, this is balanced by strong structural growth drivers, a diversified customer base, and a fast-growing business in the media and entertainment industry, which is on a completely different cycle. The companys revenue base is still heavily weighted to Europe, but internationalization is increasing. The company is in the early stages of transitioning its customer base to a subscription model that is mainly delivered in the cloud. There is always a degree of uncertainty associated with any transition of this nature in the timing of legacy customer migration. Acquisitions are a core part of Nemetscheks strategy, which leads to the potential to overpay for potential targets and integration risk. Historically, the company has paid reasonable prices and integrated its acquisitions successfully. From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we see low risk for investors. Data privacy and security will be an increasingly important area of concern as more of Nemetscheks customer base transitions to the cloud. Further, given the complexity associated with software development, the company faces competition for skilled labor. If Nemetschek is unable to effectively source and integrate new employees, it could hinder innovation and affect its competitive positioning.","We assign Nemetschek an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, this rating reflects a sound balance sheet, exceptional investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distribution policies. Around 51% of the company is still owned by the Nemetschek family through various foundations. The companys debt load is modest and the companys asset-light business model generates a lot of free cash flow. The maturity schedule is balanced. Nemetschek is a company that has largely been built through acquisitions. Consequently, we think the companys track record of consistent growth, margin improvement, and high ROIC is strong evidence that its investment efficacy has been exceptional, and we expect this to continue in the future. Arguably the companys most significant acquisition was Bluebeam, which was bought in 2014 for $100 million or around 3 times its sales. Since that time, Bluebeam has grown to be Nemetscheks biggest software brand and also one of the most profitable. With software companies typically trading at 6 times their sales on average, and Nemetschek often trading at much higher levels, certainly this acquisition has created a significant amount of value for the group. Another foundational acquisition was Graphisoft, which was purchased in 2007 for EUR 95 million or around 3.5 times its sales. Other notable acquisitions include Risa in 2017 at 3.3 times its sales, dRofus in 2016 at 5.4 times its sales, and Solibri in 2015 at 9 times its sales. Nemetscheks dividend policy is to distribute around 25% of its operating cash flow, which we think is appropriate for its cash flow profile, cyclicality, and investment requirements that typically lead to ongoing acquisitions. The company does not typically buy back shares. ","Nemetschek is a German company that makes software products for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry mainly, but also for the media and entertainment industry. Its software solutions cover the entire life cycle of building and infrastructure projects (design, build, and manage). In media and entertainment, it is one of the worlds leading providers of software for the creation of 3D animation and visual effects in movies, TV shows, and gaming.","Nemetschek is in a strong financial condition. The company has substantial cash on its balance sheet and carries minimal debt. As of 2022, net debt/EBITDA was negative. Nemetschek has a high-margin business and produces ample free cash flow. As the company transitions to a subscription-based delivery model, the cash flow stream should become increasingly resilient.",NEM.DE,Technology,9112949760.0,GER,8422.0,EUR,81.30000305175781,True,0,64.8758618146586,82.53253026755543,0
24/11/2023,Eastman's Specialty Chemicals Should Benefit From Long-Term Demand Growth Despite Near-Term Slowdown,Eastman Chemical Co,EMN,4,,Seth Goldstein,81.43,USD,23/11/2023,125.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,,No Text Available,"Eastman is well positioned to meet evolving chemical demands in auto with window interlayers and specialty plastics through its best-in-class patented products. Eastman's investments in plants that use sustainable-based feedstocks, including recycled chemicals and wood pulp, should benefit from growing demand for specialty plastics made from these feedstocks. As Eastman continues to develop new patented products, it should expand its specialty chemicals business, which generates higher margins and commands some degree of pricing power.","While the company's coal gasification is a low-cost method compared with many international competitors, other Eastman products are made with higher-cost petrochemicals. As a middle-cost player in many of its downstream chemicals, Eastman's profits are in danger of a narrowing oil/gas spread. The majority of Eastman's products are not specialty chemicals, which leaves the company more exposed to the volatility of the cyclical commodity chemicals industry.",14/11/2023,"Through acquisition and internal development, Eastman Chemical owns a solid portfolio of specialty chemicals. Its specialty chemicals include plastics and components used in safety glass, window tinting, and specialty plastics, all of which offer a solid long-term growth profile. To increase its specialty portfolio, the firm invests roughly 4% of sales from its additives and functional products and advanced materials segments in research and development, which is in line with its specialty chemical peers. Eastman is well positioned to meet growing demand for auto window interlayers, including heads-up displays, and specialty plastics. Eastman also holds a solid position in acetate tow, which is primarily used to make cigarette filters. The acetate tow industry has experienced falling prices due to overcapacity in China over the past several years. However, a handful of players dominates the industry, a factor that led to disciplined capacity shutdowns by all of the major companies during the industry downturn. To offset some of the decline, Eastman has been investing in capacity for other uses for its fibers, including fabrics and apparel. Eastman uses multiple feedstocks, including natural gas, coal, wood pulp, and recycled chemicals and plastics. It plans to widen its recycled plastic feedstock capacity over time, which will replace traditional carbon-based feedstocks. The company's long-term goal is to eventually make all its cellulosic plastics and polyesters from plastic waste. We think this strategy will provide Eastman with solid growth as demand for products from this feedstock grows over time. Further, the company can charge a premium for its sustainable feedstock-based products, which allows it to recover the higher cost of production. Eastman's coatings, adhesives, specialty polymers, fluids, and inks businesses generate solid operating margins. Along with the fibers segment, these businesses provide a relatively stable earnings base to offset swings in other areas. As with other chemical companies, Eastman's business model is subject to a high degree of operating leverage, as changes in volumes can have an outsize impact on profits.","We award Eastman a narrow moat rating based on the intangible assets stemming from its patent-protected specialty chemicals portfolio. We generally view chemicals companies through the commodity processors moat framework. Chemicals producers can earn a moat if they covert commodity chemicals into patented, differentiated products, which generates pricing power, or if they have a cost advantage in producing commodities. We think the former applies to Eastman.Eastman's patent-protected specialty chemicals generate 50% of sales in its additives and function products segment and the majority of sales in the advanced materials segment. Its products have an average patented commercial life of 10 years. While Eastman sells a diverse portfolio of chemicals that have a wide range of end uses, its customers choose Eastmans products for their superior characteristics versus its competitors. For example, the company's automotive glass interlayers are among the best in the industry, making Eastman a preferred supplier for automakers that install a heads-up display, which projects key metrics such as speed limit onto the front windshield, to their vehicles. Eastmans glass interlayers are also among the best at controlling cabin temperatures. They should benefit from greater demand as increased electric vehicle sales will require energy-efficient windows to extend battery range.This dynamic of Eastman producing the best products in a given segment results in pricing power for the company as evidenced by the companys ability to raise prices during cost inflation and hold prices when its commodity chemical inputs see falling prices.In recent years, Eastmans specialty chemicals have contributed a greater portion of sales as the company has divested more commoditized businesses in the additives and function products and chemical intermediates segment. Although some of Eastman's products are low-cost, we don't think the cost advantage moat source is strong enough on its own to support a moat for the company. Eastman's ethylene and propylene production uses low-cost U.S. natural gas, which gives the firms olefin stream a low-cost base. While Eastman's coal-based production of methanol, acetic acid, and other chemicals gives the company a low-cost base for some of its products, the coal-based feedstock makes other products more expensive. On a consolidated basis, we think Eastman's cost position is on the lower half of the cost curve, which supports the intangible assets moat source and helps the firm generate positive economic profits, but in isolation, it is not low enough for us to award the firm a cost advantage.All in all, we award Eastman a narrow economic moat as its patented-protected specialty chemicals combined with its solid cost position give us confidence that the firm will outearn its cost of capital over the next 10 years.","We assign Eastman a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. As a chemical manufacturer, Eastman's profits are tied to the health of end-market customers, and, while the company has a fairly diverse customer base, roughly half of its end markets are more cyclical. The cost of raw materials also affects the company's fortunes. If Eastman is not able to pass on higher costs to customers, its profitability will suffer. To boost margins, Eastman has focused on the development of patent-protected specialty chemicals that have an average commercial life of around 10 years. However, if it is unable to develop new products to replace formulas that roll off patent, or if its new products fail to generate the same incremental demand growth from its end users, its ability to command a premium price for its specialty products would deteriorate.As a chemicals company, Eastman faces a decent amount of environmental, social, and governance risks, primarily related to its carbon emissions and the environmental impact of its products. It produces chemicals from high-sulfur coal, which expose it to potential emissions regulations that could disproportionately affect Eastman over other chemicals producers that use only natural gas. We see a moderate probability and moderate impact if this were to occur.Eastman is also at risk of product bans due to environmental concerns. While we see a moderate probability that this occurs, Eastman would likely be able to reformulate its chemicals, resulting in a low long-term impact.The acquisition of Solutia brought environmental liabilities from the legacy Monsanto chemical business at two sites. Under the settlement agreement with Bayer (Monsanto), Eastman will pay the first $325 million, then the two companies will split additional costs evenly.Similarly, Eastman faces risk of future environmental liabilities should new regulations result in the need for cleanup. We see a moderate probability and moderate impact if this were to occur.","We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Eastman based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.We view the balance sheet as sound. While Eastman has medium unleveraged business risk, the debt load is manageable. We expect that net debt/EBITDA will remain under 3 times over the next several years and that the company should be able to pay or refinance its near-term maturities.We see management's investments as fair. We are in favor of management's strategy to grow organically and continue to invest in the development of new products in its specialty chemicals portfolio. We are also in favor of the investments in recycled plastics and chemicals technologies, as this should position the company for future growth. However, we view many of these investments as necessary for Eastman to maintain its ability to charge a premium price. Additionally, we are in favor of management's divestitures of more commoditized adhesives and resins products, as this should allow greater focus on growing the specialty products within the additives and functional products segment.We think distributions are appropriate. Eastman should have sufficient cash flows to pay down debt and maintain its dividends.Mark Costa became CEO in early 2014. He joined Eastman in 2006 as a senior vice president of marketing, strategy, and business development. He has held various positions of increasing responsibility at the company and served as Eastman's president before being appointed to the CEO position. Costa is also chair of the board.Management's long-term compensation is based on return on capital and total return to stockholders. We are in favor of the return on capital metric as we think this encourages management to invest in more valued-added areas of the business, such as continuing to develop new patented specialty chemicals that command pricing power.","Established in 1920 to produce chemicals for Eastman Kodak, Eastman Chemical has grown into a global specialty chemicals company with manufacturing sites around the world. The company generates the majority of its sales outside of the United States, with a strong presence in Asian markets. During the past several years, Eastman has sold noncore businesses, choosing to focus on higher-margin specialty product offerings.","Eastman is in good financial health. As of Sept. 30, it carried around $4.8 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. We calculate net debt/adjusted EBITDA of 3.1 times.Eastman plans to sell its Texas City acetyls production business to INEOS for $490 million, with Eastman receiving $415 million when the deal closes and the remainder over the next two years. Eastman plans to use the proceeds after taxes and fees to pay down debt. Given its strong free cash flow generation, we think Eastman will have no trouble meeting its financial obligations, including dividends. Assuming no major acquisitions are made, we think the company will be able to return its leverage ratios to management's long-term target of 2.0-2.5 times as EBITDA recovers after the current economic slowdown. However, the cyclical nature of the chemicals business could cause coverage ratios to fluctuate from year to year.",EMN,Basic Materials,10128120832.0,NYQ,826973.0,USD,81.43000030517578,True,1,77.1647920496341,85.99338559751605,1
24/11/2023,Narrow-Moat Icon Continues To Benefit From Strong Outsourcing Demand,Icon PLC,ICLR,3,26/10/2023,Rachel Elfman,271.92,USD,23/11/2023,243.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,26/10/2023,"Icon reported solid third-quarter results, highlighted by revenue exceeding $2 billion, representing an increase of nearly 6% from the prior-year period. We continue to have a positive outlook for the firm, and we maintain our fair value estimate of $243 per share. We reaffirm our narrow economic moat and Medium Uncertainty Ratings for Icon. We view shares as fairly valued, and the stock is currently trading in 3-star territory. We continue to forecast 2023 revenue will reach about $8.1 billion, representing growth of 5% over 2022. We anticipate high-single digit revenue growth over the next few years thanks to positive clinical research outsourcing trends. We forecast operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points over the next 10 years as Icon scales its operations. Icon's narrow moat is supported by high customer switching costs and strong intangible assets, as evidenced by healthy demand for the company's clinical trial services. Icon's net business wins were nearly $2.6 billion during the quarter, and it reported a net book/bill ratio of 1.26 times. Icon's backlog grew to a record $22.2 billion, representing an increase of 10% year over year. We continue to believe Icon's 2021 acquisition of PRA Health Sciences for $12 billion strengthens the company's global footprint and creates a more diversified therapeutic portfolio with broader service offerings, further enhancing the company's narrow moat. We like that management has focused on paying down debt from its acquisition of PRA Health Sciences, and Icon ended the quarter with a net debt/trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times, which is down from 2.5 times at the end of the second quarter and significantly lower from 3.4 times at the end of 2021. Additionally, S&P Global Ratings recently upgraded Icon to an investment-grade credit rating of BBB- with a stable outlook based on operating performance and deleveraging.","Icon is highly exposed to the late-stage CRO industry, which due to its complexity is conducive to long-term competitive advantages. The companys operational discipline should support strong earnings growth and high returns as Icon expands.  As an Irish company, Icon benefits from a lower tax rate than many of its peers based in the United States. ","Drawbacks to biotech funding or declines in outsourcing penetration rates could have a material impact on Icon's growth. Icon could fail to innovate and keep an edge over regional and global CRO competitors, especially as data and analytics play an increasing role in clinical development. Icon is taking on a lot of leverage with its acquisition of PRA, so it will need to focus on integrating its businesses to achieve its anticipated synergies while paying down its debt.",28/07/2023,"We believe Icon possesses all the necessary elements to win share in the late-stage contract research organization market: global capabilities, full-service offerings, extensive regulatory and clinical expertise, investment in innovation and technology, and operational excellence. Icon is one of a handful of CROs with the global infrastructure to carry out late-stage, multinational trials and hone international regulatory expertise.  Icon competes in one of the most lucrative areas of the CRO market: long, complex trials that require hundreds if not thousands of patients and thus have ample room for missteps. Late-stage trials consume a significant portion of drug patent lives, making reduction in clinical trial time a priority for CROs and their pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. Icon has done well in focusing on driving trial efficiencies, with consulting services and technology for patient identification and clinical trial management. As a result, we expect the firm to profit from near-term increases in outsourcing, and we are closely watching nascent trends in drug development, including the potential of real-world evidence and the use of data and analytics to reduce a drug's time to market.  The firm's historically conservative approach to capital allocation and investment had kept revenue growth relatively moderate in the past few years--in the midsingle digits, save for a boost in 2012 through 2014 due to capacity expansion after a couple of lucrative deals with Big Pharma companies. In July 2021, Icon completed the $12 billion purchase of competitor PRA Health Sciences. While we anticipate an increase in returns and cost-saving synergies realized within four years of the acquisition, the returns will nevertheless be partially diluted by goodwill due to the 30% premium that Icon paid. Operationally, Icon boasts impressive margins compared with similar-size peers. Its disciplined acquisition strategy has kept returns above its cost of capital and strengthened its core competencies, making it the closest pure play in the late-stage CRO industry. We expect the company will be able to maintain operational excellence over time.","We believe Icon's global CRO business warrants a narrow moat due to its significant late-stage trial exposure and intangible assets of proprietary data and technology, expertise, and client relationships. We believe that exposure to late-stage clinical trials is crucial for moats in the CRO space as late-stage trials are larger in scope, more complex, and often multinational and have higher risks of failure, which enforces switching costs. As more complex trials provide room for differentiation, global CROs leverage their expertise to shorten the clinical trial time frame and ensure accuracy and precision. Drugs typically have a 20-year patent life span, which begins at discovery. This means that clinical trials consume a significant portion of what could otherwise be patent-protected profits before generic drugs come to market. As a result, biopharma companies seek to shorten the drug development period as much as possible while maintaining the precision and accuracy necessary for a drug's approval. This is the driving force in the CRO business model, in which CROs leverage their assets and expertise to design a trial tailored to regulatory technicalities, quickly identify target patients at sites around the world for rapid enrollment, and then advise on data collection and analysis for regulatory approvals. The speed and quality of these trials are essential since late-stage clinical trials are expensive and the stakes for a successful outcome are high. There is a high risk of failure at each step of a drugs development process, and clinical trials are very expensive. According to a 2020 study released in JAMA, the median cost of developing a new drug was $985 million with the average cost totaling $1.3 billion. The study was based on data for 63 drugs developed by 47 companies over 2009-18.Icon's sound bolt-on acquisition strategy has built out a wide portfolio of capabilities, including imaging, central laboratory, all phases of clinical trials, staffing solutions, consulting, commercialization, and technology solutions, while historically maintaining adjusted returns well above its cost of capital and those of its peers. In July 2021, Icon completed the acquisition of competitor PRA Health for $12 billion. This combines the fifth- and sixth-largest CROs by 2020 revenue and enhances Icons global footprint, creating a more diversified therapeutic portfolio and broader service offerings. However, due to the size of the acquisition, adjusted returns on invested capital will be temporarily diminished. Icons adjusted ROICs are projected to be slightly below the weighted average cost of capital through 2026. According to the terms of the deal, Icon paid a 30% premium to PRAs closing price as of Feb. 23, 2021. Icons ROICs excluding goodwill are well above WACC throughout the forecast period. We anticipate many synergies from the PRA Health acquisition, including an enhanced global footprint, a more diversified portfolio, and broader service offerings. Additionally, there will be cost synergies and tax synergies as the blended company will be headquartered in Ireland.Each narrow-moat CRO under our coverage is in what we consider to be the top tier of the industry, and each has developed its own way of improving site identification and patient recruitment. While there are variations, each method hinges on patient data. Icon has a database of 300 million patients and PRA Health has 280 million patients. Combined, it will have the second-largest patient database in the industry, behind IQVIA's database of over 600 million patients (from IMS Health, its legacy data business). These large patient databases, combined with the recruitment and consulting capabilities of CROs, offer a key service to biopharma clients that cannot be replicated in-house. Even sophisticated, large pharma clients don't have the breadth of expertise and knowledge of regulatory requirements that CROs offer through their services.Icons impressive capabilities have attracted large pharmaceutical clients, including a preferred partnership with Pfizer. Historically, Icon's revenue heavily relied on Pfizer, its largest customer, but the firm has diversified, removing some of the client concentration risk that affected Icon in late 2016 and early 2017, when Pfizer canceled late-stage trials of bococizumab. Previously, Pfizer accounted for a third of Icons revenue, but it now represents about 12%, and we expect this to continue to decline as diversification remains a top priority for the firm. Icon continues to win new business from this top customer, in addition to other large pharmaceutical firms and small/midsize clients. We believe that a diversified client base strengthens Icon's competitive advantage as small/midsize clients are likely to need full outsourcing solutions, while large pharmaceutical companies offer profitable preferred partnerships with high switching costs. Large pharmaceutical companies typically select a handful of trusted CROs to run their clinical trials. For example, Pfizer extended its preferred partnerships with Icon, Syneos, and PPD in 2020. All have been long-standing CRO partners for Pfizer, which has always relied heavily on outsourced trial providers. Top-tier companies in the CRO industry are not just outsourced providers, but they are also professional service providers. Biopharma clients choose the top-tier CROs to run their clinical trials for their intangible assets, reputation, and long-standing partnerships. We think this dynamic, along with increasing outsourcing penetration, allows for multiple moats to exist in the same industry among top-tier CROs. Small, midsize, and large biopharma clients see high switching costs with global late-stage CROs. No matter the size of the client, late-stage trials are always complex, lengthy, and have a high risk of failure. Biopharma clients are reluctant to switch CROs during a drugs development and transfer late-stage work to another CRO. Additionally, companies typically stay with their selected CRO throughout the drugs lifetime for the continued study and development of booster drugs/vaccines. These switching costs are partly supported by familiarity, in which clients prefer the continuity of working with the same trusted CRO as it is very familiar with the clients' needs, systems, and methods. Pfizer is Icon's largest and longest customer, with a working relationship spanning 30 years. This highlights the high switching costs and lengthy relationship that is difficult to replicate.Icon is well positioned to carry out next-generation decentralized trials and real-world evidence trials thanks to a series of recent acquisitions. In 2019, Icon acquired Symphony Clinical Research, a provider of in-home and alternate-site services. This has boosted Icons hybrid clinical trial services, which has proved beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic as many trials have shifted to remote methods. Additionally, Icon launched Accellacare in September 2020, which allows customers to deploy decentralized trials and offers faster access to innovative treatments. Accellacare enhances the patient experience either at traditional clinical testing sites or at home as part of integrated operations with Symphony. This approach is leading to higher patient recruitment in a shorter time frame and greater retention rates for clinical trials. Recent interest in decentralized and real-world evidence trials underscores the increased importance of CROs like Icon expanding their service offerings by integrating data and analytics into their business models.","The CRO industry depends highly on the research and development spending of its customer base: biotech and pharmaceutical companies. While Icon offers an attractive value proposition to its customers, we believe CROs' exposure to outsourcing decisions and biopharma R&D spending warrants a medium uncertainty rating. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges that affect healthcare systems and clinical trial work; however, we believe Icon adapted well and seems to have rebounded from client disruptions, reporting strong new business wins.While we don't believe a decrease in R&D spending or outsourcing is likely in the near term, all CROs are exposed to these risks if biopharma funding is constrained or if there are changes in the drug-approval regulatory landscape. If Icon does not continue to invest in innovative technology or next-generation processes, it is at risk of falling behind and losing share to more-innovative CROs that can offer faster patient enrollment and shorter trials.Icon is also vulnerable to large cancelations and pipeline reprioritizations since it can be challenging to immediately repurpose capacity for new projects. Previously, Pfizer accounted for a third of Icons revenue, but it now represents about 12%, and we expect this to continue to decline as diversification remains a top priority for the firm. Icon's diverse client base allows it to have more flexibility and be less susceptible to this risk. We note that Icon continues to win new business from Pfizer, in addition to other large pharma firms and small/midsize clients. We estimate that about 60% of revenue comes from large biotech/ pharma companies and the rest from small and midsize customers.Product governance is a key ESG risk for Icon and the rest of the CRO industry. CROs must ensure that trials meet strict quality and safety standards from a variety of regulatory entities. Icon is exposed to the risk of losing market share to competitors if its trials lag on quality.","We assign Icon a Standard capital allocation rating. Our analysis evaluates what we determine to be the three key facets of management decision-making from the perspective of shareholders: balance sheet strength, investment efficacy, and distributions. Our Standard rating results from a sound balance sheet, fair investment strategy, and an assessment of shareholder distributions as appropriate. Icon's balance sheet is sound, with its revenue cyclicality and operating leverage each possessing a medium rating. Icon has historically maintained a fairly conservative balance sheet, and it ended 2022 with over $289 million in cash and cash equivalents.We view Icon's investment decisions as fair. Due to the $12 billion acquisition of PRA Health, representing a 30% premium, adjusted returns on invested capital are forecast to be slightly above WACC, including goodwill, by our calculations. We viewed the shares of PRA as overvalued as the stock was trading at a 45% premium to our fair value estimate of $88 on the day the closing price for the transaction was set. While we anticipate the acquisition will be accretive, returns will nevertheless be diluted by goodwill. We still anticipate Icon will make some bolt-on acquisitions in the long run; however, integrating and achieving the synergies of the PRA acquisition will be a priority along with paying down debt from the acquisition.We assess overall shareholder distributions as appropriate. Even though the company does not currently pay a dividend, we view this as appropriate since Icon is growing quickly and investment helps build its value and support its narrow moat.Icon is led by CEO Steve Cutler, who took the helm in 2017. Icon's executives and its directors have decades of experience spanning the CRO industry, regulatory expertise, medical research, finance, and law. Nonexecutive chair Ciaran Murray served as CEO from 2011 to 2017 following the retirement of Peter Gray, who served as CEO for nine years. A strategic partnership with Pfizer was formed during Gray's tenure as CEO in 2010, followed by a three-year agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2011. Largely thanks to these partnerships, the first half of Murray's time as CEO saw double-digit annual revenue growth (2012-14) as Icon expanded capacity for new business. However, management's capital allocation strategy during these years was rather conservative, taking on little to no debt despite healthy cash generation. The firm did not seriously begin buying back shares until 2014 and did not keep significant debt on the balance sheet until 2015. Since then, we believe the company has effectively balanced capital deployment between share repurchases and acquisitions. Since Cutler began as CEO, Icon has benefited from industry tailwinds with strong biotech funding and a record of new drug candidates. Before becoming CEO, Cutler served as COO from 2014 and has been with the company since 2011. We had historically not seen anything indicating that he was significantly straying from Icon's moderate capital allocation and highly selective bolt-on acquisition strategy. However, Icon's acquisition of PRA Health Sciences in July 2021 makes the combined company the second-largest CRO by revenue behind IQVIA. The acquisition enhances Icon's global footprint, creates a more diversified therapeutic portfolio, and broadens its service offerings. The combined company will continue to be led by Cutler and CFO Brendan Brennan. PRA CEO Colin Shannon joined the board after the transaction closed.Growing by acquisitions is a common expansion strategy among the larger late-stage CROs, but Icon has not had any serious missteps with its history of reasonably priced and modestly sized acquisitions. Before PRA Health Sciences, the company's largest recent acquisitions were Aptiv in 2014 for statistical planning software and a range of full-service offerings ($144 million), MediMedia Pharma Solutions for marketing and commercialization solutions in 2015 ($116 million), and Mapi for real-world evidence strategy in 2017 ($144 million). The company made no major acquisitions in 2018 and limited capital allocation to smaller acquisitions in the following year, purchasing MolecularMD, a diagnostics company, MeDiNova Research, a network of research sites, Symphony Clinical Research, a provider of at-home patient services, and MedPass International, a medical devices CRO. We believe these tuck-in acquisitions have strengthened Icon's core competencies and supported its narrow moat in the CRO space. By historically focusing on smaller acquisitions, management avoided overpaying for large acquisitions.","Icon is a global late-stage contract research organization that provides drug development and clinical trial services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device firms. While the vast majority of its revenue comes from clinical research, Icon also offers ancillary services such as laboratory and imaging capabilities. The company is headquartered in Ireland.","Icon has historically maintained a fairly conservative balance sheet. It ended 2022 with $289 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, down substantially from 3.4 times at the end of 2021.Icon completed its acquisition of PRA Health Sciences in July 2021 for $12 billion. It financed the deal with 48% cash and 52% stock. Icon raised $6 billion of debt to finance the PRA Health deal. It was broken into two instruments: $5.5 billion of floating term loan B notes over a seven-year period and $500 million in a fixed high-yield bond over a five-year period.Even though Icon took on significant leverage to fund this acquisition, we do not have major liquidity concerns as the company has demonstrated its operational discipline. Both Icon and PRA have strong records of positive free cash flows and maintain healthy balance sheets.",ICLR,Healthcare,22182184960.0,NMS,456078.0,USD,271.9200134277344,True,0,251.6352946561942,286.5706186176778,1
24/11/2023,Expedia's Investments Behind Unifying Its Platform Support Its Network Advantage,Expedia Group Inc,EXPE,4,,Dan Wasiolek,136.89,USD,23/11/2023,178.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,,No Text Available,"Expedia has a dominant network effect that we think only a few can enjoy, and recent investments to unifiy its platform and acquisitions stand to add to the company's platform advantage. Expedia removed $700 million-$750 million in annualized fixed costs in the years following the pandemic. Further, Expedia has removed $200 million in variable costs. We see some of these savings reinvested back into its platform. Expedia stands to benefit from remote work flexibility increasing long-term demand for travel.","Google continues to siphon free organic traffic in favor of its own platform, causing incremental marketing costs for Expedia. The unknown extent and duration of inflation could materially affect demand for travel content offered on Expedia's platform. Competition from existing peers (Booking, TripAdvisor, Google, Costco, Alibaba, and Airbnb) and new entrants (Meta) could meaningfully affect Expedia's growth outlook.",06/11/2023,"Expedia's investments in a unified platform, which shares data, supply and loyalty (OneKey) across its brands, versus having it in a siloed structure previously, stand to support its network advantage, the source of its narrow moat. We think worker flexibility will increase long-term travel demand. We developed this positive stance because higher-income occupations (like those in technology, finance, legal, and architecture) are in industries that are the most likely to support ongoing work from remote locations. Expedia has built a leading network of online travel services, which has driven a strong user base. We expect this network effect to remain over the next decade, although supplier consolidation creates some headwinds in U.S. markets. In addition, replicating Booking's leading network in Europe, while not an insurmountable hurdle, will involve marketing and labor investments over the coming years. However, Expedia's investments to further expand its international presence should support its network advantage over time. Also, in emerging markets, the company has a collaboration with Trip.com, the leading online travel agency in China. Finally, the company's Vrbo brand gives Expedia a leading share in the fast-growing online vacation rental market, only behind Airbnb and Booking Holdings. During 2020-21, Expedia achieved the removal of $700 million-$750 million in annualized run-rate fixed costs. Also, Expedia has taken out $200 million in variable costs. We expect the company to reinvest some of these cost savings in building its network through brand marketing, loyalty and user experience enhancements over the next few years. We see its powerful network advantage driving higher direct traffic (which have no marketing costs), allowing the company to offset pressure from indirect channels like Google (which add to marketing costs). We refrain from awarding Expedia a wide moat, as the online travel industry is competitive and focused entry from Google, Meta, Amazon, Alibaba, Costco, and others could double the current handful of players with dominant scale, leading to a meaningful impact on profitability.","We believe Expedia has a network advantage, the source of its narrow moat. Over the past two decades, Expedia has built a strong network of properties (the supply side of the network effect equation), which has driven strong end-user traffic and bookings (demand side of the network effect equation). At year-end 2022, the Expedia's global platform had 3 million properties, made up of over 2 million alternative accommodation listings and 900,000 hotel units. On the demand side, as measured by App Annie on Oct. 30, 2023, Expedia's core platform ranks as a top-10 travel iOS mobile application in 23 countries versus 134 for narrow-moat Booking.com, and 92 for narrow-moat Airbnb.We think efforts to migrate technology, data, supply, and loyalty capability onto a unified platform versus previously managing the divisions separately in silos will support the company's network advantage. Specifically, we believe this investment will give platform users more content choice, ability to accrue and use loyalty points across brands and receive more targeted offerings, thereby aiding sales. Also, the ability to share data across all brands, versus having it imprisoned within individual brands that were previously competing against each other for customers, should allow a more targeted and high return on marketing spend.As a result of the strong network effect, Expedia and Booking combined control the majority of the global online travel agency booking market. Beneath these two, share is highly fragmented, making it extremely challenging for smaller new entrants to gain customer traffic and supplier scale. Smaller new entrants would need substantial human capital to build relationships with hotels and gather crucial information/pictures from those hotel properties. They would also need to spend heavily on advertising to attract customers to the website, and any customers obtained would require IT, data center, and 24/7 customer support to retain. Expedia is able to advertise well in excess of competitors, which helps drive its network advantage. In 2022 Expedia spent $5.4 billion on direct marketing (47% of total revenue), while Booking spent an estimated $6 billion in 2022 (36% of total revenue); in comparison, number-three player Orbitz spent $334 million on advertising in 2014 before it was acquired by Expedia in 2015. As scale is built, understanding of consumer behavior also increases, which leads to improved customer experience and conversion.We don't believe the company has carved a wide moat, given potentially meaningful competition beyond the next 10 years from new entrants that already have the customer traffic and budgets to build network scale, including wide-moat Google, wide-moat Meta, wide-moat Amazon, narrow-moat TripAdvisor, wide-moat Costco, and hotel consortia. Focused entry from these competitors would double the current handful of players that have dominant scale, leading to commodification of the industry and a meaningful impact on margins. That said, we expect the market to support some level of increased competition over the next several years. The travel booking market remains large at $1.9 trillion, and we believe online penetration of the travel market can continue to expand the next 10 years from its current mid-60% level.","Our Expedia Morningstar Uncertainty Rating is High.Focused entry from companies such as Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Costco, and Meta could have a meaningful impact on Expedia's growth.The travel industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic growth, geopolitical conflicts, and illness outbreaks like COVID-19. In a downturn, consumers have less income and therefore could cut back on discretionary expenses like leisure travel. Expedia is not immune here, as revenue growth was essentially flat in 2009 excluding TripAdvisor. At that time, the still-low penetration of online travel bookings in developed markets helped prevent a more severe decline. If an economic downturn were to occur now, developed markets would not offer the same cushion as they did in 2009 because of more mature penetration and increased competition. That said, the nascent penetration of emerging and mobile markets would probably offer some cushion to a weaker economic growth environment. In any event, any economic downturn would result in Expedia's growth slowing. Finally, Expedia faces ESG risks regarding innovation, tax code changes, data breaches, and potential fees should its platform be viewed as anticompetitive. We don't see these ESG factors materially altering Expedia's competitive position or fair value estimate.","We view Expedia's capital allocation as Standard, as our favorable basis on its investment strategy is offset by a weaker balance sheet and mixed views on shareholder distribution.We are favorable on Expedias recent investment strategy (announced February 2020) to drive cost efficiency and then reinvest savings in customer experience and loyalty, which we believe will lead to higher-quality direct traffic and support the companys network effect. Expedia has removed $700 million-$750 million in annualized fixed costs during 2020-21 (about 8% of 2019 operating expense at the midpoint), through labor and overhead. Further, Expedia has removed $200 million in variable costs. The company has also moved from an inefficient invest-in-every-brand-in-all-regions approach to efficiently investing in brands only in specific regions where they are resonating with travelers. And Expedia is also focusing on shared data analytics among its brand portfolio, a simplified user experience, and a connected trip offering, all of which make strategic sense and should help drive high-quality direct traffic, buttressing Expedias competitive position. We like that Expedia is focusing on its existing brands versus looking at acquisitions, where the company has had a mixed track record. For example, while we view the past Travelocity, HomeAway (now Vrbo), and Orbitz acquisitions making strategic sense, the price paid has been some concern, evidenced by the $886 million impairment taken on Trivago and Vrbo in the first quarter of 2020. Further, spinning off the leading metasearch platform in late 2011 (TripAdvisor) only to buy a smaller metasearch platform a year and a half later (Trivago) appears to have been questionable.We are mixed on Expedia's shareholder distribution. We would welcome a discussion to eliminate dividends altogether over the next several years, given the growth opportunities of the industry and for the company. We are encouraged that Expedia's recent share repurchase activity appears more opportunistic than programmatic, with the company buying $1.8 billion worth at an average share price of $104 in the first three quarters of 2023, which we view as positive given the discount to our intrinsic value that represented.Expedia's financial health profile looks balanced. Here, the company has $1.0 billion in debt maturing during 2025. We expect debt reduction, shareholder return mostly through share repurchases, and investment back into its network advantage to remain top capital-allocation priorities for management.","Expedia is the world's second largest online travel agency by bookings, offering services for lodging (76% of total 2022 sales), air tickets (3%), rental cars, cruises, in-destination, and other (14%), and advertising revenue (7%). Expedia operates a number of branded travel booking sites, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Travelocity, Orbitz, Wotif, AirAsia, and Vrbo. It also has a metasearch brand, Trivago. Transaction fees for online bookings account for the bulk of sales and profits.","Expedia made it through the COVID-19 lower demand period of 2020-22, due to its intact network advantage generating strong free cash flow, and aggressive measures the company took to enhance its liquidity profile.The company returned to cash flow break-even for the first time since February 2020 in September 2020. Expedia acted quickly in the first half of 2020 to lift its liquidity profile, including suspending its share repurchases, tapping $1.9 billion of its $2 billion credit facility, and raising several billion dollars in debt and equity. Further, it has removed $700 million-$750 million in expenses, via fixed-cost efficiencies, which we view as prudent. Also, should there be a long cyclical downturn in demand (which we see as unlikely), stressing Expedia's financial situation, we believe banking partners and credit markets would be interested in working with the company, given its sizable network advantage and cash flow generation during normal travel demand environments.Its debt/adjusted EBITDA finished 2022 at 2.8 times versus 2019's 2.6 times mark, while its EBIT/net interest expense was 2.0 times last year compared with 5.5 times in 2019, before the pandemic. As Expedia's revenue recovers fully by 2023, we expect its debt/adjusted EBITDA and EBIT/net interest ratios to reach 2.4 times and 5.3 times, respectively. Expedia has manageable debt maturity over the next few years, with $1 billion and $1.7 billion due in 2025 and 2026, respectively. This view is supported by our forecast for Expedia to generate $8.1 billion in free cash flow to the firm during 2023-27.",EXPE,Consumer Cyclical,19342913536.0,NMS,3259853.0,USD,136.88999938964844,True,1,107.97976478127883,143.31419824671235,1
24/11/2023,We Expect a Constructive Rate Case Outcome in Alliant's Wisconsin Territory ,Alliant Energy Corp,LNT,4,03/11/2023,Andrew Bischof,49.54,USD,23/11/2023,58.0,Low,Narrow,Standard,B,03/11/2023,"We are maintaining our Alliant Energy $58 per share fair value estimate after the company reported third-quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, compared with $0.93 in the same year-ago period. Management narrowed 2023 EPS guidance to $2.85 to $2.93, from $2.82 to $2.96. Our $2.90 per share estimate remains unchanged. The company initiated 2024 EPS guidance of $2.99 to $3.13, an implied 6% increase and consistent with the company's long-term 5% to 7% earnings growth target. We think the company can achieve the high end of that growth range.Alliant trades at a 13% discount to our fair value estimate as of Nov. 2, offering investors an opportunity to buy at an attractive price a high-quality utility operating in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with good management execution. Alliant expects to pay a dividend of $1.92 per share in 2024, a 6% increase from $1.81 in 2023. We expect dividend growth in line with our earnings growth forecast. Alliant's 2024-27 capital investment plan supports our earnings growth forecast. Management increased its capital investment plan to $9.1 billion, up from its previous four-year plan totaling $8.5 billion. The increase is attributable to wind repowering opportunities, grid modernization, and additional transmission opportunities at minority-owned ATC. We continue to view Alliant's main two regulatory environments, Iowa and Wisconsin, constructively. Alliant received advanced ratemaking on 400 megawatts of solar at an above-average 10.25% allowed return on equity. In Wisconsin, we expect Alliant to secure a constructive outcome in its pending rate case similar to the terms that peer Wisconsin utility WEC Energy receive in its recent rate decision. President and COO Lisa Barton will become CEO effective Jan. 1. We think Barton is an excellent choice, given her extensive experience in executive positions at American Electric Power before joining Alliant in early 2023.","Alliant's earnings growth prospects are robust, supported by renewable energy projects that have regulatory support. Regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin are embracing renewable energy, providing additional growth opportunities with favorable rate-making. The company operates in constructive jurisdictions, supporting returns and capital projects.","Alliant's aggressive investment plan increases regulatory risk. Should economic recovery slow in Alliant's major markets, Iowa and Wisconsin, customer and load growth could slow. As with all regulated utilities, rising interest rates will raise financing costs and could make the dividend less attractive for income investors.",09/08/2023,"Our forecast for Alliant Energy to invest over $10 billion from 2023-27 supports our estimate for the company to achieve the top half of management's 5%-7% growth target. Management estimates continued capital investment opportunities in the second half of the decade, supporting growth beyond our forecast. Interstate Power and Light, or IP&L, continues to build out renewable energy in Iowa. In addition to its significant wind generation in Iowa, for which the company earns a premium return on equity, the subsidiary now aims to install significant solar generation as well as distributed energy resources. We continue to believe Iowa offers ample renewable energy investment opportunitiesboth wind and solarto support the utility's Clean Energy Blueprint, which plans to eliminate all coal generation by 2040 and achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. At Wisconsin Power and Light, renewable energy is also a focus as the company begins replacing retiring coal generation. WPL plans sizable solar energy investments paired with battery storage. WPL has similar clean energy goals IP&L, including a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, eliminating coal from its generation fleet by 2040, and reaching net-zero carbon emissions from its generation fleet by 2050. Alliant benefits from operating in what we consider two of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions. To maintain earned returns near allowed returns during this period of high investment, management has worked to reduced regulatory lag, received above-average allowed returns across its subsidiaries, and aims continue to reduce operating costs for the near term. At WPL, Alliant Energy filed a rate case that asks regulators to maintain its 10% allowed ROE with modest revenue increases in 2024-25. A decision is expected later this year. We expect an outcome consistent with WEC Energy Group's 9.8% allowed return in its rate outcome last year, which we viewed as constructive. American Transmission Co., which we consider a wide-moat business, is tucked away from consolidated results (16% equity interest). Transmission offers higher returns relative to other rate-regulated investments.","Service territory monopolies and efficient-scale advantages are the primary sources of economic moat for regulated utilities such as Alliant. State and federal regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks. In exchange for regulated utilities service territory monopolies, state and federal regulators set returns at levels that aim to minimize customer costs while offering fair returns for capital providers. We believe Alliant has healthy relationships with the regulators in its two main states, Iowa and Wisconsin, as exemplified by mechanisms that allow the firm to more closely earn its allowed return on equity.This implicit contract between regulators and capital providers should, on balance, allow Alliant to earn greater than its cost of capital, though observable returns might vary in the short run based on demand trends, investment cycles, operating costs, and access to financing. Intuitively, utilities should have an economic moat based on efficient scale, but in some cases regulation offsets this advantage, preventing excess returns on capital. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions prevents regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moat ratings to many regulated utilities.","We rate Alliant Energy with a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Low.Alliant Energy's ability to secure rate adjustments depends on maintaining constructive relations with regulators. If regulatory relations sour, regulators could cut the utility's allowed return, resulting in earnings and cash flow pressure. We expect continued constructive regulation across Alliant's service territories, including Alliant's rate case in Wisconsin.Customer resistance to higher rates creates uncertainty surrounding Alliant's growth. Like all regulated utilities, the company must obtain regulators' approval to charge higher rates to fund investments. If regulators don't incorporate adequate profits in allowed rates, the company might cut investment. The company has a significant ongoing development program that is subject to potential cost overruns and political and regulatory risk. Alliant Energy operates natural gas distribution utilities. While we think natural gas will remain the primary source for heating in the Midwest for the foreseeable future, there is risk that policymakers will expedite the shift away from natural gas. Alliant faces environmental, social, and governance risk, particularly given its relatively large coal fleet. Regulators and politicians across its service territories are embracing tighter policies on carbon emissions and greater restrictions on coal generation. Alliant is addressing this risk through its base capital investment program, planned coal retirements, and the addition of renewable energy. Alliant's aspiration of being a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050, with an interim 50% reduction target by 2030, is in line with its utility peers. The company aims to eliminate coal from its generation fleet by 2040. Regulators across its jurisdictions are supporting this transition.Alliant Energy faces the risk of an inflationary environment that raises borrowing costs and makes other investments more attractive for income-seeking investors.","We assign Alliant Energy a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessment of Alliant's balance sheet strength, management's investment decisions, and plans to return capital to shareholders. Alliant Energy has consistently paid out 60%-70% of earnings as dividends, an amount we view as appropriate, given the high quality and relatively stable nature of Alliant's regulated assets. We expect the balance sheet to remain strong, in line with its regulatory requirements and supported by the company's low revenue cyclicality and operating leverage. We expect the company's investment strategy to focus on growing assets through regulated investments, which we think is a reasonable approach.We think shareholders have benefited from management's focus on regulated operations. The company's utilities have earned at or near their allowed returns, a remarkable achievement with aggressive capital spending plans.Service territories in areas with good renewable energy resources have created investment opportunities that management has pursued with success. Management has worked well with state regulators, ensuring excellent regulatory treatment for wind investments, particularly in Iowa.CEO John Larsen, an Alliant Energy veteran who has held numerous positions in engineering and generation, has been CEO since 2019. He previously was president of Alliant Energy and previously president of Wisconsin Power and Light. The company hired Lisa Barton as executive vice president and chief operating officer, likely positioning her to succeed Larsen when he retires. Barton has extensive executive utility experience and we think she would be a strong replacement for Larsen.","Alliant Energy is the parent of two regulated utilities, Interstate Power and Light and Wisconsin Power and Light, serving nearly 985,000 electric customers and 425,000 natural gas-only customers. Both subsidiaries engage in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas. Alliant also owns a 16% interest in American Transmission Co.","With our estimate for $10.5 billion of capital spending planned through 2027, we expect Alliant will be a frequent debt issuer. We also expect the company to issue $1.25 billion in equity to maintain its allowed capital ratios for regulatory purposes. The company has manageable long-term debt maturities, and we anticipate it will be able to refinance its debt as it comes due. We expect total debt/EBITDA to remain around 5.0 times.Even with its large capital expenditure program, Alliant maintains a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We expect total debt/capital to remain around 55% through our forecast. Interest coverage should remain around 5 times throughout our forecast period. Alliant has ample liquidity with cash on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facilities. We believe Alliant's dividend is well covered with its regulated utilities' earnings and expect the dividend payout ratio to remain between 60% and 70%. We expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings.",LNT,Utilities,13139167232.0,NMS,2267916.0,USD,49.540000915527344,True,1,49.359125339285875,49.39918899536172,0
24/11/2023,Volkswagen Stock Undervalued as Transition to Electric Vehicles Progresses,Volkswagen AG,VWAGY,5,26/10/2023,Richard Hilgert,12.95,USD,24/11/2023,37.0,High,,Standard,,26/10/2023,"No-moat Volkswagen reported third-quarter earnings per share of EUR 7.76, beating the EUR 7.07 FactSet consensus by EUR 0.69 and up EUR 0.63 from the EUR 7.13 reported last year. Consolidated revenue rose 12% to EUR 78.8 billion from EUR 70.7 billion a year ago and 3% higher than consensus. Industrial revenue increased 9% on solid pricing, mix, and volume partially offset by output disruption (chips, logistics, flooding in Slovakia), negative currency effect, while consolidated deliveries increased 14% to 1.5 million versus 1.3 million last year when the chip crunch was worse. Third-quarter group adjusted EBIT of EUR 4.9 billion increased 16% from EUR 4.3 billion last year, while margin expanded 20 basis points to 6.2%. Strong year-over-year margin improvement at Skoda, vans, and Traton were partially offset by supply chain disruption and inflationary cost pressures at Volkswagen brand, Audi, and Porsche as well as mounting losses at Cariad (software group) and battery group for a 5.9% industrial EBIT margin versus 4.6% last year. Financial-services-adjusted EBIT dropped 46% to EUR 775 million from EUR 1.4 billion a year ago due to higher interest rates. Group EBIT missed consensus by 11%. Management's unchanged 2023 guidance includes deliveries of 9.0 million-9.5 million vehicles, consolidated revenue of EUR 307 billion-EUR 321 billion, and group adjusted EBIT of 7.5%-8.5%. We estimate volume at 9.2 million and consolidated revenue of EUR 314 billion. We assume 7.5% margin as high uncertainty from industry headwinds remain in 2023. The time value money added EUR 7, raising our fair value estimate to EUR 351 from EUR 344. The 5-star-rated ordinary shares trade at a compelling 69% discount to our new fair value estimate, while the preferred shares are more attractively valued at a 72% discount.","With substantial liquidity and a conservatively financed capital structure, Volkswagen has a high degree of financial flexibility and is well positioned to weather the lingering effects of COVID-19 and the microchip shortage. Volkswagen's presence in global markets reduces reliance on any one regional economy and improves growth prospects as developing markets offset mature ones. As the company manufactures entry-level to ultraluxury as well as small delivery vehicles to the largest of on-highway heavy trucks, its dependence on a single vehicle segment is limited.","Volkswagen has one of the most aggressive product plans in BEVs, substantially increasing cost, while global light-vehicle demand is at risk from lingering coronavirus effects, the chip crunch, and the Ukraine crisis. Volkswagen is in the highly cyclical, capital-intensive, mass-market automotive business, where overcapacity restricts pricing and constrains economic profits. Substantial ownership by the state of Lower Saxony in Germany, where Volkswagen is based, allows the state the right to block major decisions, leaving management open to the government's agenda.",26/10/2023,"In our view, Volkswagen is successfully executing a global automotive strategy and has one of the most aggressive plans to switch to battery electric vehicles from internal combustion powertrains. A broad array of brands, serving multiple segments, reduces reliance on any one vehicle category. As one of the world's leading volume producers, Volkswagen's economies of scale from common platforms across a number of models enable cost savings unattainable by smaller competitors. The company owns premium brands Audi and Porsche, ultraluxury brand Bentley, and the Italian exotic sports car maker Lamborghini. However, potential moatiness from these storied brands is offset by mass-market Volkswagen, Skoda, and Seat brands, plus the more cyclical commercial vehicle business. Worldwide prepandemic and pre-chip-crisis, vehicle deliveries were nearly 11.0 million. In 2022, vehicle deliveries totaled 8.5 million. Volkswagen's MEB platform underpins its current BEV offensive. By the end of 2022, the company had 27 BEV models derived from MEB. In 2023, Volkswagen will launch its unified battery cell strategy that targets an 80% sales volume penetration by 2030 and anticipates a 50% entry-level segment battery cell cost reduction as well as 30% savings in the volume segment. In 2025, Volkswagen expects BEV to account for 20% of global sales. Also in 2025, the company is to introduce its Scalable Systems Platform for the next BEV generation and on which, all brands' models will be based. The new platform will be fully digital, utilizing the firm's VW.OS operating system developed in-house by Volkswagen's Cariad software group. The company believes that its share of in-vehicle software will climb from 10% in 2020 to 60% for vehicles launched on the SSP architecture.  We like that Volkswagen has pursued a common architecture manufacturing strategy. We think the strategy, which increases economies of scale, will continue to reduce cost. However, the MEB common architecture strategy presents a risk if consumer demand for BEVs does not materialize. Volkswagen targets adjusted EBIT margin of 7%-8% in 2025, up from its 6.0% 15-year historical median.","In general, automotive manufacturers are no-moat companies that face challenging competition, high capital intensity, and cyclical demand. Volkswagen is no exception. Even though the automobile is a modern-day engineering marvel that requires enormous talent and organizational skill to design, develop, and bring to market, a lack of barriers to entry (other than high up-front capital investment and compliance with every countries' safety and emissions regulations where vehicles are sold) is evidenced by growing global industry overcapacity.Mass-market automakers' hard-fought market share is won, and temporary economic profits achieved, by three typical routes. First, automakers seek to introduce a radically new design that defines a new vehicle niche (Chrysler's introduction of the minivan in the 1980s, Toyota's launch of the RAV4 crossover in the early 2000s). Second, original-equipment manufacturers race to be the first to market a dramatically differentiated technology (Toyota's Prius electric hybrid vehicle in the early 2000s). Finally, some firms consistently have the youngest portfolio of products through frequent new-vehicle introductions and substantial redesigns. The Japanese in the 1980s and 1990s had a competitive advantage by cutting their time to market in half relative to that of other manufacturers. German automakers like Volkswagen maintain high cash balances to enable continued product launches during demand cycle lows.Even though Volkswagen enjoys premium pricing in many markets, other competitors have been able to achieve the same perceived value among consumers. While Volkswagen brands like Bentley, Lamborghini, and Porsche evoke images of wealth, luxury, and exotic street-legal racing machines, consumers of these products can easily switch to a competitor's product such as Ferrari, Aston Martin, or Rolls-Royce. In high-volume markets, fickle consumers can switch among competing brandsand quite often, they do. The latest fads, hottest styles, high-profile recalls, high dependability ratings from consumer publications, and utilitarian needs can all factor into consumers' buying decisions. For price-conscious, educated shoppers, dependable transportation at an affordable price is all that's required, and it doesn't matter which manufacturer's vehicle they buy, just as long as it's the best deal they can find. In this instance, consumers can easily switch from SEAT, Skoda, or Volkswagen to Fiat, Peugeot, Opel, or Toyota, then back again. Other consumers view their vehicles as extensions of themselves and are willing to pay a premium for a machine that exudes a certain image. Volkswagen's Audi or Porsche brands might be a consideration for such a consumer, along with Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, and even Cadillac in the United States. Brands in the Volkswagen portfolio serve consumers looking for vehicles in nearly every segment. Volkswagen's ultrapremium brands (like Lamborghini) sell low volume but provide solid margins because of their stratospheric prices. Generally, ultrapremium brands experience less downside volatility than high-volume brands because recessionary periods rarely dissuade wealthy customers from purchasing. Although luxury brands (like Audi and Porsche) are generally more profitable than their high-volume counterparts, unit sales can be more susceptible to volume swings during economically challenging times as consumers consider more austere personal budgeting. Volkswagen uses the Audi, Porsche, and Volkswagen brand names in foreign markets. SEAT and Skoda are regional brands focused mainly in Spain and Eastern Europe, respectively. However, Skoda is also sold in China as a low-end, budget-priced, entry-level vehicle.Models in the Volkswagen-branded portfolio serve consumers looking for vehicles in nearly every segment up to near luxury, ranging in size from the smallest A-segment cars (Volkswagen Polo) to the largest J-segment sport utility cars (Volkswagen Touareg). While the Volkswagen brand enjoys a favorable image and pricing, it has less panache with U.S. consumers than among consumers in other parts of the world.The Volkswagen brand name is also used for light commercial vehicles in many world markets. Through its ownership in Scania, MAN, and Navistar, the company has exposure to medium- and heavy-duty truck demand. However, medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturing is even more capital-intensive and cyclical than the light-vehicle group, which constrains economic profit.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Volkswagen is High. Risks include an unexpected drop in global vehicle production, commodity costs, and a unionized workforce. A sudden drop in volume can lead to substantial margin erosion on unfavorable operating leverage. Global industry overcapacity risks long-term economic profitability. The company's aggressive transition to BEVs could present a risk if consumer demand to does not materialize.Volkswagen has environmental, social, and governance risk exposure, which we include in our fair value estimate and High Uncertainty Rating. Business ethics risk was heightened with Volkswagen's diesel emissions cheating scandal in 2015 as well as its inclusion in an EU antitrust case regarding diesel equipment collusion among German automakers. Various dieselgate lawsuits remain outstanding. We assume EUR 10 billion for emissions settlements in our valuation.Corporate governance risk is also affected by the diesel controversies. Volkswagen is controlled by the Porsche/Piech family which holds 53.3% of the voting rights. Lower Saxony's ownership (20% of the voting rights) and board representation leaves management vulnerable to government influence. Union board representation could restrict necessary cost reduction initiatives.The company is transitioning to zero-emission electric vehicles from greenhouse gas-emitting internal combustion engines. While the company currently sells EVs, ICE vehicles will likely still be sold to consumers for at least the next decade. All automakers' vehicles, including Volkswagen, have product governance risk exposure from potential recalls, ICE vehicles risk compliance with clean air regulations, and there is the risk associated with compliance of various governments' safety regulations. Volkswagen's products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain highly skilled human capital with expertise in software and various engineering disciplines.","We assign Volkswagen a Standard capital allocation rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized durable midcycle, we estimate Volkswagen's return on invested capital falls short of its weighted average cost of capital by 1.1 percentage points, and since 2012, ROIC has been below WACC by 0.8 percentage points on average.The balance sheet, with financial services on an equity basis, is sound with negative 0.9 times net debt/EBITDA and a net debt/total capital ratio of negative 10.7% at the end of December 2022, both ratios indicating a net cash position. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound and estimate a three-year forward average net cash position with a negative 0.9 times net debt/EBITDA ratio. Since 2012, the company has returned roughly EUR 25.3 billion to investors in the form of stock dividends. During the past 15 years, Volkswagens median dividend payout ratio is approximately 19.5%. Despite cash conservation measures deployed because of COVID-19, Volkswagen maintained the same dividend in 2020 as 2019, EUR 4.80 per ordinary share and EUR 4.86 per preferred share. Management has a strategic goal of a 30% dividend payout ratio.While the diesel crisis exposed a corporate control weakness, we applaud management's efforts to offset cash outlays related to the diesel scandal with operational cost reductions while maintaining product development and a dividend, albeit at a substantially reduced rate. Having a large cash hoard helped to buffer the blow, resulting in no incremental debt to the industrial balance sheet. Due to anticipated cash outflows for the diesel scandal and higher spending for powertrain electrification, Volkswagen cut its 2015 dividend to EUR 0.17 per share from EUR 4.86 in 2014. Since then, dividends annually increased to the 2018 distribution of EUR 4.86 per share, which the company held constant through 2020. The board will propose a EUR 8.70 ordinary and EUR 8.76 prefered dividend payout to shareholders from 2022 earnings in 2023.Volkswagen governance includes the supervisory board and the board of management. The supervisory board of Volkswagen appoints members to the board of management, monitors the management team, and approves major strategy and capital decisions. The supervisory board, which is led by Hans Dieter Poetsch (previously chief financial officer), comprises 20 members, including individuals representing major constituencies like labor and large shareholders. The board of management, now chaired by Oliver Blume (also CEO of Porsche), is composed of 11 members, each responsible for specific functional areas of the organization.Volkswagen's 23-member board lacks the degree of independence we favor, but this is common among international companies. German law mandates an 80% supermajority vote to implement changes in controlling interests.Even though it's common among European companies, union and government representation on the supervisory board is cause for concern. So far, though, this has not had meaningfully negative effects on managerial decisions and Volkswagen's success. While executive compensation seems reasonable, we are critical of the company's lack of disclosure on the financial metrics that determine cash bonuses.","Volkswagen is one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers. Automotive brands include Volkswagen passenger cars, Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, and Skoda. Commercial vehicle brands include MAN, Navistar, Scania, and Volkswagen. The company's financial services group provides dealer financing to support floor plans, consumer financing for vehicle purchases, vehicle leasing, banking, and other financial services. In 2022, Europe was Volkswagen's largest light vehicle market at 41% of total volume, followed by China at 37%, and rest of world at 22%.","Historically maintaining a conservatively financed operation with ample liquidity, Volkswagen is in solid financial shape. However, emissions-related costs could be a risk to financial health if fines, lawsuits, and the cost to fix or compensate consumers are worse than expected. As of 2022, consumer advocacy groups in Europe and U.S. consumers opting out of class-action status still have outstanding litigation. Barring additional substantial emissions-related litigation costs, automotive leverage is low, with a substantial cash hoard.Since 2012, when comparing the automotive cash balance with the automotive operation's debt balance, Volkswagen has maintained a net cash position that has produced impressive negative net debt/total capital (negative 10.7% average) and net adjusted debt/EBITDAR (negative 0.5 times average, includes effect of operating leases) leverage metrics, as cash balances have exceeded automotive debt outstanding.Volkswagen group's capital structure is fairly complex because of the financial services business; in addition to consumer and dealer lending operations, the group has insurance and banking operations. Since 2012, considering the financial services group on an equity basis, excluding the impact of balance sheet cash, Volkswagen has very healthy average automotive leverage ratiostotal debt/total capital and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR were 11.4% and 1.0 times, respectively.Volkswagen garners an investment-grade rating, which enables the financial-services group access to capital at relatively lower rates. The diesel scandal did not impede the company's ability to borrow or cause a significant change in the cost of debt capital. In our opinion, Volkswagen's hoard of cash, conservatively financed capital structure, and ability to generate substantial free cash flow will enable the company to weather a substantial cyclical downturn, assuming emissions-related litigation cash outlays remain manageable.",VWAGY,Consumer Cyclical,64516665344.0,PNK,201826.0,USD,12.949999809265137,True,1,13.43969412410941,13.874243875836584,1
24/11/2023,"Carlsberg Loses Russian Assets, but Has Runway for Growth Elsewhere",Carlsberg A/S,CABGY,3,01/11/2023,Philip Gorham,24.92,USD,23/11/2023,25.0,Medium,,Standard,,01/11/2023,"Carlsberg reported a broadly in-line third-quarter trading update, but we are lowering our fair value estimate to DKK 870 per share from DKK 970 due to the value destruction created by the loss of the company's Russian business. Carlsberg had been attempting to find a buyer for Baltika Breweries in order to comply with sanctions against Russia, but we now believe it will not receive any compensation for these assets, and we assign a zero value to them. The market appears to have anticipated this development, and we believe the stock is fairly valued. Carlsberg narrowly missed our third-quarter forecasts, but there were some positives from the trading update. Revenue growth was marginally above that of competitor Anheuser Busch InBev, and management reiterated full-year guidance of organic operating growth of 4% to 7%. Our full-year estimate is at the lower end of that range. Third-quarter revenue grew 5.8% organically, and was flat on a reported basis, with price/mix of 9% and an organic volume decline of 3%. The good news is that inflationary pressures, while still present, appear to have begun to fade. Price/mix was similar to those of the second quarter, but down from the 12% reported in the first quarter. The bad news is that volume is finally cracking under the pressure of the stacked price increases. The third quarter was the first time this year volume had turned negative. We anticipate inflationary pressures to ease further from the fourth quarter, however, and more balanced growth between volume and price/mix next year. Carlsberg initiated a share repurchase program of DKK 1 billion, perhaps indicating management shares our view that the cost environment is moderating. With the shares fairly valued, we doubt this will create long-term value and think the capital would have been put to better use in building share in some of Carlsberg's premiumizing markets such as Southeast Asia.","Although Carlsberg is underindexed in premium segments, it does have a presence with brands such as Tuborg, 1664 Blanc and Brooklyn, and the premiumization of the portfolio could be seen as a long-term opportunity. Carlsberg is present in the attractive markets of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and has the opportunity to raise its economic interest in its local subsidiary, Habeco. Management's medium-term guidance around its SAIL'27 strategy implies that there is more margin expansion to come in the years ahead, which will further close the financial performance gap to Heineken.","The shift to low and no-alcohol beer creates uncertainty around volume and the crossover of brand equity into these categories. Price/mix is likely to underperform that of competitors due to lower brand equity, a disadvantage that has manifested occasionally in recent years through some shelf space loss. Carlsberg lacks a dominant multinational brand like Heineken or Budweiser, which could restrict its scale efficiencies.",01/11/2023,"Carlsberg has a reasonably strong namesake brand and a portfolio of superpremium brands that position it well for ongoing premiumisation. It has strong positions in a cluster of generally small markets, notably the Nordics and western China, but is a second-tier player in other larger markets such as the U.K., Germany and Vietnam.  Nevertheless, Carlsberg had historically struggled to earn its cost of capital, but under several strategic programs, including Funding the Journey and SAIL'22, Carlsberg has closed the financial performance gap to its peers and delivered much stronger returns on capital and returns to shareholders. Organic sales grew by over 3% annually over the five years of the program, in spite of the COVID-19-related declines in 2020, and almost 200 basis points were added to the operating margin, which stood at 16.3% on an adjusted basis in 2022. Benchmarking against competitors, however, we believe there is further room for improvement, and we are encouraged that the recently unveiled SAIL'27 strategy suggests more profitability improvement to come. Mix should play a pivotal role. Some of Carlsberg's markets, including China, are undergoing structural premiumization, and the premium and above portfolio, including the Tuborg and 1664 lager brands and Brooklyn craft beer, as well as line extensions to the Carlsberg brand, including an alcohol-free line, should continue to grow at rates above the market. Medium-term guidance under SAIL'27, the latest five-year plan, is 3%-5% organic revenue growth. We think this is reasonable and we forecast medium-term growth at the midpoint of that guidance, and we expect volume declines of beer in developed markets to be offset by value growth from premiumisation elsewhere. Carlsberg has runway for growth in Southeast Asia, where consumption increases and premiumization should drive multiyear growth. Carlsberg is the leading brewer in Ukraine and Belarus. However, Carlsberg was forced to exit Russia this year, and we do not expect the company to receive any compensation for the assets.","Stronger execution and a focus on returns on capital employed contributed to Carlsberg generating excess returns on capital over the last eight years, but we still believe the company lacks the structural competitive advantages to ensure this performance can be maintained for at least a decade. We are not too concerned about Carlsbergs smaller global volumes relative to AB InBev and Heineken because it is regional scale that creates a cost advantage. The provincial nature of most beer brands means that costs (packaging, manufacturing, distribution and marketing) are leveraged on a regional basis. Even on this basis, however, Carlsberg lags its closest competitors, with the bulk of its volumes spread over competitive markets in which it has fairly low market shares.Carlsbergs most competitively advantaged market is Asia. According to Euromonitor and data disclosed by the company, Carlsberg has volume shares of 56% in Nepal, where it is the leading brewer, and of 43% in Malaysia, where it is number two. These are growing and premiumizing markets, but Carlsbergs position is not dominant in the way Ambev is in Latin America or Heineken is in parts of southeast Asia. Volume share exceeds 50% in the markets where Ambev and Heineken are most dominant. Even in China, which will become the company's largest market when the operations in Russia are divested, Carlsberg held a volume share of just 7% in 2021, through its consolidation of Chongqing. It should be noted, however, that Carlsbergs footprint in China is limited to western provinces, and that on a value basis, Carlsbergs market shares are higher in these markets because of its skew to premium brands. Nevertheless, the fragmentation of Carlsbergs volume across its footprint is detrimental to the creation of a cost advantage.Western Europe is Carlsbergs largest segment by volume, revenue, and EBIT, but this is a competitive market in which Carlsberg is often a second-tier brewer. Western Europe displays the characteristics of aspirational markets: developed economies in which alcohol consumption has often peaked and the consumer is trading up not only within the beer category, but out of it and into wine and spirits. Mainstream beer brands compete against each other on price, while also facing competition on product differentiation from Belgian beers, and more recently, US-style craft, in the superpremium segment. Only in very few markets do any brewers have a critical mass of scale to be able to operate at a lower cost structure than peers, therefore. From the GlobalData figures, only in Norway and Poland does Carlsberg have dominant volume share, although it is also the market-leader in Sweden and Switzerland, and we believe its volume share is slightly over 50% in Denmark. In almost all other Western European markets, its market share is in the single digits, and its competitive positioning is weak. This was apparent in 2015 when Tesco removed Carlsberg from its shelves during a cull of bands and SKUs. Eastern Europe is Carlsbergs other major market, but in no single market does its volume share exceed 20%.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Carlsberg is Medium, which is consistent with our ratings of the other brewers under coverage. Although Carlsberg will divest its Russian operations, events in Russia over the past few years have shown that one of Carlsberg's critical business risks is the attempt by governments to control alcohol consumption, whether that be through tax policy or other legislation. Governments sometimes use the industry as a way to raise the tax rate while incurring limited political risk.Although Carlsberg holds the number-one share position in several markets, its shares are not as dominant as those of its larger rivals, and it faces strong competition from the large global players in almost every market. The risk of shelf space loss to competitors with greater capacity to compete on price is arguably the greatest risk to Carlsbergs cash flows and occurred in 2015 when Tesco removed the flagship brand from its shelves. Competition also comes from other alcoholic beverage categories, such as value and mainstream distilled spirits.Carlsberg faces some environmental, social, and governance risks, although they are limited in probability of occurrence and materiality. Health and wellness trends suggest that over time, fewer consumers may consume alcohol. The emergence of low and no alcohol beer categories at margins above core beer brands should ensure that such a development is limited in its financial impact, however. Consumer pushback against certain packaging remains a risk, although brewers use few PET materials in their packaging, and the more common beer cans and bottles are both recyclable. The risk of a water shortage would have limited financial impact for Carlsberg, as we estimate it represents a low-single-digit percentage of cost of goods sold.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Carlsberg is Standard. We have been impressed by the focus and performance delivery of the management team under Cees 't Hart, and we believe the dilution risk to equityholders that has occurred in the past is now limited. Management has taken steps to shore up the balance sheet, and has lowered net debt/EBITDA to just 1.5 times at the end of 2022. Following the S&N acquisition in 2008, Carlsberg's net debt/EBITDA ratio peaked to 4.1 times.Investment has been low key, and Carlsberg has not participated in the large-scale global consolidation that has been driven by AB InBev, and did not show much interest in any of the assets that became available during ABI's transformative acquisition of SABMiller. M&A has been bolt-on in nature (in 2020 the company acquired rights to Brooklyn Lager and Marston cider, as well as Wernesgruener Brewery in Germany). None of these deals are likely to set the world alight but do give Carlsberg access to some growing brands, while allowing the firm to meet its financial discipline objectives. It is possible that Carlsberg could look for more transformative deals, and if it adds assets that could help to build an economic moat, we would consider a rating of Exemplary for this impressive management team.Management has achieved a significant improvement in financial performance and shareholder returns over the last few years. By 2018, it had delivered a dividend increase of 60%, strengthened the balance sheet to a net debt/EBITDA level below the target of 2.0 times, raised adjusted ROIC, which now runs consistently above the company's cost of capital, and an increased free cash flow of around DKK 2 billion. Distributions are now in line with Carlsberg's large-cap fast-moving consumer good peers.The Carlsberg Foundation owns 30% of the share capital and controls 75% of the voting rights of Carlsberg A/S, with the remainder of the capital and voting rights being free float. However, in October 2013, the foundation amended its charter so that it could lower its stake to 25% of the share capital and 51% of the voting rights by issuing shares. This presents shareholders with the risk of dilution in the event that the firm wishes to enter into a large acquisition. There is a precedent for such an event. In 2008, when the firm participated with Heineken in the acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle, it raised DKK 30.5 billion through a rights issue that priced at a steep 40% discount to the prevailing market price. Given that ROICs were subsequently below Carlsberg's weighted average cost of capital for several years, we believe that despite its size, the deal did not help to create an economic moat and was not particularly value-enhancing. Nevertheless, with Carlsberg now in better financial shape, we believe equity dilution is a low-probability event. CEO Cees 't Hart will only serve until the third quarter of 2023 at the latest, and will be replaced by Jacob Aarup-Andersen. Andersen has been CEO of ISS since 2020, where he delivered significant improvements in financial performance and growth.","Carlsberg is the fourth-largest brewer in the world following the combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, with major operations in Russia, Europe, and Asia. It holds leading share in Scandinavia, Switzerland, Portugal, Laos, Nepal, and parts of western China. Its key brands include Carlsberg, 1664, Tuborg, Holsten, and Somersby. The company's 2022 beverage volume, excluding Russia, was split among Northern and Western Europe (35%), Eastern Europe (26%), and Asia (39%).","Carlsberg is in sound financial shape, and after a multiyear period of paying down debt, it is now less leveraged than Heineken and AB InBev. Following the S&N acquisition in 2008, Carlsberg's net debt/EBITDA ratio increased to 4.1 times. Since that time, debt has fallen from DKK 48 billion to just DKK 20 billion at year-end 2022, when the adjusted net debt/EBITDA ratio stood at 1.5 times. Under the SAIL'22 initiative, management targeted a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2 times, which it has met comfortably, but it is notable that no leverage metrics were included in the SAIL'27 targets, so it seems likely that management is giving itself some room for acquisitions, share buybacks or special dividends.Carlsberg increased its annual dividend 60% in 2018 and after further steady increases averaging 11%, its adjusted payout ratio was 48% last year. This is more or less in line with the large-cap consumer staples peer group. We forecast free cash flow to average over DKK 13 billion over the next five years and an average of DKK 4.3 billion to be paid out in dividends at the new annualized rate, and with leverage well under control, Carlsberg now has more balance sheet optionality than it has had in several years. The company repurchased DKK 4.4 billion last year, and the announced repurchase program was concluded with a further DKK 1.5 billion in buybacks in January 2023.Acquisitions could be one use of the company's excess cash. That said, Carlsberg showed little interest publicly in the assets being divested by AB InBev as part of the SABMiller acquisition, and most deals have been bolt-on in nature in recent years. We think the Grolsch and Peroni brands, sold to Asahi, had the potential to be value-accretive to Carlsberg. With roughly DKK 16 billion in annual EBITDA, Carlsberg could comfortably make acquisitions of roughly $5 billion by leveraging up to around 3.5 times net debt/EBITDA.",CABGY,Consumer Defensive,18068135936.0,PNK,90921.0,USD,24.920000076293945,True,0,26.01894937403059,25.278448575804937,0
24/11/2023,JLL's Brokerage Business Will Continue To Be Affected by Lower Transaction Volume,Jones Lang LaSalle Inc,JLL,4,02/11/2023,Suryansh Sharma,155.24,USD,23/11/2023,203.0,High,Narrow,Standard,C,02/11/2023,"Narrow-moat-rated Jones Lang LaSalles third-quarter results were middling as the capital markets and leasing businesses were impacted by the industrywide slowdown but the outsourcing business remained strong. The company reported that global investment sales were down 48% during the third quarter, with the Americas down 51%, EMEA down 51%, and Asia-Pacific down 24%. The decline in investment sales was broad-based and impacted all sectors, but multifamily and offices were impacted the highest. Global office leasing volumes were also down 6% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2022. In the industrial sector, gross leasing volumes in the U.S. and EMEA were down significantly on a year-over-year basis and were also below the five-year historical average. Industrial net absorption in the Asia-Pacific region remained strong and was considerably above the five-year historical average. We think that the pressure on the brokerage business will continue in the near term given our macroeconomic outlook and rising interest rates. The company reported adjusted net income of $98 million or $2.01 per share in the third quarter, down 41% compared with the $165 million or $3.40 per share reported in the third quarter of the previous year. The companywide fee revenue was down 13% in the current quarter compared with the previous year as it was reported at $1.79 billion. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $205 million, 26% lower compared with the third quarter of 2022. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.0% for the quarter, down 150 basis points compared with the third quarter of last year on a local currency basis. The margin compression in the current quarter can be mainly attributed to declines in the brokerage business that has been impacted by higher interest rates and a challenging environment for commercial real estate. We are maintaining our $203 per share fair value estimate for the firm after incorporating the third-quarter results.","As one of the largest of only a few truly international one-stop shops, JLL is poised to continue taking share from competitors in a growing industry that increasingly rewards scale.  JLL has been investing aggressively in its internal tech-enabled platforms and other early-stage property tech companies. These investments position the firm to benefit from tech disruptions in the sector.  Real estate is increasingly being recognized as an established asset class, which will translate to ever higher allocations toward the space, benefiting JLLs LaSalle business.","The effects of technological disintermediation have the potential to erode the value of the expertise and services that JLL provides to its clients, negatively impacting its capital markets. An increase in interest rates can pressure overall commercial real estate transaction volumes affecting the companys margins in the brokerage business.  The long-term outlook on office real estate brokerage remains uncertain as office utilization rates remain tepid with employees hesitant in returning to the office.",03/08/2023,"Jones Lang LaSalle has benefited from the secular trends in the real estate services industry and has experienced explosive growth over the past decade as it recovered from the global financial crisis in 2007. The firm has transformed itself into a more resilient cash flow generator throughout the business cycle by broadening the basket of services that it provides and capturing an increased wallet share of real estate spending. The firm is a leader in inter-regional transactions, and we believe that its recent efforts to further enhance cross-functional cooperation and improve connectivity across various geographical regions will drive new growth opportunities and ensure better service to its multinational clients. JLLs strategy to become a single-source provider for the full spectrum of real estate-related services has enhanced the value proposition of its services, reduced the overall volatility in the business, and increased the stickiness of its clients. The company has been a beneficiary of a consolidating industry and has successfully completed various material acquisitions that have expanded its geographical presence, added incremental capabilities, and solidified its competitive positioning in local markets. The firm has also been actively investing in early-stage property tech companies that accompany strategic partnerships to drive growth and enhance JLLs service capabilities. The leasing and capital market segments provide full-service brokerage and have a higher cyclicality in revenue. By contrast, the work dynamics segment, which represents the outsourcing business, provides a contractual stream of revenue. The project & development segment conducts the management of real estate projects while the advisory, consulting, and other segment provides solutions related to workplace strategy, digitization, valuation, and so on. The real estate investment management business is held under LaSalle. We think JLL should be able to post healthy growth rates as it continues to take share from its smaller competitors and benefits from rising capital flows into real estate, increasing corporate outsourcing, and growth in urbanization.","We believe Jones Lang LaSalle has built a narrow-moat business that benefits from intangible assets and switching costs, supported by the companys strong brand, superior market intelligence, its broad scale, and various structural elements inherent to the commercial real estate service industry. Given the recent consolidation and industry dynamics in the space, we believe that JLL will be able to maintain its market-leading position.Intangible Assets:JLLs preeminent competitive position derives in large part from its long track record of effective service for clients, which has bolstered its brand. We think this history has made it a trusted provider of commercial real estate services, supporting an intangible assets moat source. In the real estate services industry, individual relationships, local market expertise, and perceptions are paramount to the dealmaking process, which is why we think JLLs strong reputation supports a narrow moat rating.A significant proportion of commercial real estate brokerage deals are won based on local market dynamics. Large brokerage firms with leading market shares in their respective markets execute a higher number of transactions compared with smaller brokerage firms. Therefore, the leading brokerage firms have better transaction data, local market expertise, and relevant connections which in turn helps them to better serve their clients and win more deals. This dynamic creates an information and market intelligence advantage for the company and makes it very difficult for its competitors to disrupt JLLs competitive positioning in markets where it is dominant. For instance, the company can decide not to share specific details of leasing transactions with data brokers like CoStar. This gives the company an informational advantage for leasing contracts over other players in the market.We think there is a symbiotic relationship between good producers and dominant platforms in the real estate brokerage industry. Since brokers are primarily compensated via commission that varies with productivity, it is likewise important for ambitious employees to work for firms with a strong reputation and a deep network in their desired market. This dynamic has created a virtuous cycle for the company, allowing it to simultaneously retain top talent and poach employees from its smaller competitors. We believe JLLs impressive record of talent retention supports the claim that employees clearly recognize the value of tapping into the companys deep network and enviable reputation in the industry.Large leasing and capital market transactions are often complex in nature and require many months of working with the client before the deal is closed. Brokerage firms can learn about clients unique needs, develop relationships with them and offer them tailored services. Additionally, brokerage firms are offering these transactional services through specialized account teams for their larger clients. This increases client stickiness with the broker and reduces the execution time since both parties are used to working with each other and understand their unique preferences.Jones Lang LaSalles reputation and execution capabilities also allow it to attract major multinational clients in its work dynamics business. In fact, the company currently serves large multinational corporations such as Bank of America, IBM, Procter & Gamble, and Adidas. The implementation of some of the more operationally intense outsourcing contracts for properties like data centers, life sciences, and so on also depends on the knowledge, experience, and execution capabilities of the company. The company has strategically been investing to develop new capabilities and has brought together several real estate services within a globally integrated platform that enables consistent execution on a global scale for corporate clients that want to outsource multiple services to the company. The various acquisitions and internal investments that the company has done over several years have led them to develop capabilities to compete for larger lucrative multinational contracts. Finally, the company also benefits from intangible assets in its real estate investments segment as its brand name and long investment track record attract client capital. Industry Trends & Competitive Dynamics: Companies around the globe are increasingly realizing that they are better positioned to achieve their financial and operational goals by focusing on their core business competency and leaving real estate strategy and management to specialized service providers like JLL. In addition to this, while multinationals outsourced various aspects of their real estate operations to different providers, they have been increasingly consolidating providers in recent years. In our opinion, the growth in corporate outsourcing is a secular trend in the industry and will benefit the company for many years to come. These dynamics are reflective of JLLs rapidly expanding suite of offerings that include property management, project development, advisory, maintainability, digital real estate management solutions, and consulting. Large real estate services providers like CBRE and JLL have been successful in increasing their wallet share of the real estate related spending of their clients.The real estate services industry has been consolidating over the last two decades, however, it is still a fragmented industry. Industry sources estimate that the five largest global firms combined account for less than 20% of the global commercial real estate services industry by revenue. We think that smaller boutique firms are increasingly becoming less competitive in gaining business from multinational corporations and are ceding share to global behemoths like CBRE, JLL, and Cushman & Wakefield. Leading real estate service companies have broad scale and capabilities to win major client contracts, perform market research and maintain globally integrated technology platforms that lead to improved service levels. In our opinion, there are only a few companies, including CBRE, JLL, and Cushman & Wakefield, that have the ability to provide a complete suite of services on a global footprint.We project healthy growth rates for the company as it benefits from the combination of its continued ability to take share from smaller competitors and several tailwinds in the commercial real estate industry. Among these is the increasing institutionalization of real estate, which is driving investment dollars to the space. Institutional owners tend to use JLLs services more frequently and they also tend to turn over their properties more quickly than traditional owners. This dynamic has aided the capital markets business as well as the investment management segment of the company. A related trend within the industry has been the globalization of commercial real estate, which has further led to consolidation in the form of M&A and changes in the market share of service providers. Whereas historically real estate service providers established local expertise and operated regionally, increased access to information via the internet and data from providers such as CoStar now benefits firms with a global reach. This is evidenced by the rapid pace of consolidation, with the recent HFF acquisition serving as a salient example. The company has also benefited from the corporate outsourcing trend in the work dynamic and property & facility management business segment as corporates have been increasingly outsourcing their real estate related operations to companies like JLL through multiyear, multiservice contracts which are managed by dedicated account teams. The company has been able to generate value for its corporate clients in the outsourcing business by providing convenience, streamlining real estate related costs, demonstrating consistency across clients portfolios, and enhancing the speed & agility of real estate operations. The confluence of these structural tailwinds aids JLL, which is perhaps the second-largest globally integrated player in the real estate service industry after CBRE.Switching Costs:We think that the work dynamic and the property & facility management business benefits from switching costs, reflecting the difficulty involved in switching outsourcing providers. Firms such as JLL increasingly bundle services to provide a consolidated suite of offerings. This benefits the company in the sense that it increases the stickiness of the clients, and they can better leverage certain parts of its business, such as research and software development, and it benefits clients, who receive a more tailored experience. We also believe that changing service providers in operationally intensive outsourcing contracts in sectors like life sciences and technology also entail business disruption risk. Beyond the sheer hassle of switching providers, clients do not have a lot of financial incentives in switching providers and only a limited number of companies like Cushman & Wakefield and CBRE can effectively compete for these larger contracts. As the trend of outsourcing continues and the complexity of services provided increases, it will only become more difficult to switch firms. We think the existence of switching costs is supported by the fact that the company has consistently been able to maintain a high retention rate amongst its largest clients while significantly growing its revenue from these clients.In the LaSalle Investment Management segment, we think JLL benefits from intangible assets as well as switching costs. With assets under management of over $70 billion, the company is one of the largest managers of real estate assets. Although the explicit switching costs for managed assets do not seem large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results tend to keep investor money in the same funds for long periods. Additionally, over 80% of AUM is in private real estate rather than listed securities, which lacks the liquidity of shares traded on an exchange and is thus inherently stickier. The specialized nature of these investments also insulates JLL somewhat from fee compression prevalent in the industry since its investments are considered more niche and difficult to replicate by investors.Competition Among Comparable Firms: We would like to highlight that JLL is the second-largest real estate service provider globally and its competitor CBRE has a dominant position in most markets that they compete in. Other relatively comparable competitors like Cushman & Wakefield can also match the breadth of service offerings and can effectively compete with the company for large client contracts. The service offerings of the company remain highly competitive, and we believe that the company does not have the ability to charge premium prices for its services when compared with its rivals. In addition to this, it is extremely difficult for JLL to differentiate most of its services from the services provided by competitors of comparable size. This dynamic makes it difficult to maintain pricing power for most of its services that are largely undifferentiated. We also have reasons to believe that the competition for acquiring smaller brokerage firms and unique service capabilities has been quite fierce among the larger firms. The fierce competition for M&A increases acquisition valuations and reduces the return on invested capital. In addition to this, further consolidation amongst its smaller rivals also represents a risk to the company, since it would make the competitive landscape more difficult for it to operate in.Risk of technological disruption:In the long run, advances in technology, data, and artificial intelligence have a very real potential to disrupt the traditional real estate brokerage model where brokers act as intermediaries in commercial real estate transactions. We now have technology-enabled solutions and standardized property databases that can seriously challenge the value added by a broker. In our opinion, increased data collection and data availability from companies like CoStar has the potential to shift the balance of power in favor of clients. The more clients know about the unique characteristics of a property, recent valuation of comparable properties through transaction data, and likely potential buyers, the less value a broker provides to its clients. Online commercial real estate marketplaces like LoopNet and TenX, are already providing easy access to property listings, valuation-related data, property contact information, and so on. Currently, online marketplaces are more like listing services and they monetize their platforms by providing services to brokers and other commercial real estate professionals. However, we would like to point out that in the long run, these platforms have the potential to challenge the traditional brokerage model. Having said this, we think that large commercial real estate deals which require granular analysis and local market expertise retain characteristics suitable to the current brokerage model. JLL has been investing in next-generation technologies that have the potential to disrupt the real estate industry. JLL's technologies division strategically invests in property tech companies and is a reseller of technology products that are helping companies manage their real estate portfolios. This business gives the company a unique insight into potentially disruptive solutions and emerging trends.Conclusion: Returns on invested capital (adjusted for goodwill) for JLL have consistently exceeded the cost of capital over the past decade, a period with both cyclical high and low points for the commercial real estate markets. In the stronger parts of the cycle, the firms employees share in the upside, essentially capping margin expansion potential and ROIC growth for the firm. However, in weakened environments, its professionals share in the pain as the firm is able to significantly cut costs, helping preserve reasonable profits, cash flow, and ROIC. We are confident that JLL will be able to outearn its cost of capital over the next 10 years particularly because its product mix has become more contractual and less cyclical as compared with the previous downturn. Furthermore, we view the companys outsourcing offering as significantly less cyclical than the companys other business lines. Since this business has seen significant growth lately, we think JLL is poised to better withstand future downturns.","Jones Lang LaSalle's leasing and capital market businesses are transactional in nature, and they tend to both positively and negatively magnify the volatility in the overall commercial real estate markets. An increase in interest rates can affect transaction volumes, thereby impacting the profitability of the company. The emergence of flexible workspace providers such as WeWork and Regus are a direct competition to some of the services that JLL offers. JLL works directly with many of these flexible workspace companies to broker space, but they do not have their own flexible space offerings. The company can lose market share if flex space providers become a relatively substantial part of the overall market. We think that investors must also consider the effects of potential technological disintermediation in the real estate brokerage industry. Increased access to information via the internet and data from providers such as CoStar has now made it feasible to create technology-enabled platforms that can rival the expertise and services that JLL provides to its clients, thereby negatively affecting its brokerage business lines. We think large commercial real estate deals that require granular analysis retain characteristics that emphasize personal relationships and specific expertise. However, rapid technological progress and increased data availability certainly pose a significant risk to the current business model of brokers acting as intermediaries in commercial real estate transactions.JLL relies heavily on its brand, reputation, and trustworthiness, therefore, we would view any developments that damage its reputation as being injurious to the company. Finally, consolidation among JLLs competitors would also represent a significant risk to the company since it would change the competitive landscape of the industry. We assign JLL a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, which we believe captures the spread between our bull and bear cases.","We assign JLL a Standard rating under our capital allocation methodology. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We believe that the company is in good financial health with easily manageable leverage and adequate liquidity to access future investment opportunities. The company ended the second quarter of 2023 with a comfortable interest coverage ratio, debt/equity ratio of 0.37, and liquidity of over $1.9 billion. We think that the company can support slightly higher leverage as the business mix of the company has shifted significantly toward contractual revenue, generating businesses over the last decade that can be relied upon to generate free cash flow across the business cycle.We view JLL's capital investments as fair. The company has a long-term strategy of deploying capital for acquiring smaller competitors to achieve scale in local markets and other in-fill acquisitions that help the company in building out capabilities across the world to provide a full suite of integrated services to its corporate clients. JLL has consistently been able to close on large strategic acquisitions and has benefitted enormously from the rapid consolidation in the commercial real estate service industry over the past two decades. As an instance, the recent HFF acquisition has improved JLLs capabilities in the capital market segment within the Americas region and has placed it on a better footing to compete against its bigger rival. We think that there is still room for further consolidation in the industry however the competition among the larger rivals to acquire differentiated capabilities has been fierce and most deals have been fully priced. Having said this, we would also like to point out that there are considerable synergies that can be realized following the acquisition, and the players with larger scale will increasingly have a bigger edge in the market.The company has been investing aggressively in technology internally to increase the productivity of its workforce, optimize operational efficiency, develop differentiated service capabilities, enhance cross functional collaboration, and facilitate global integration of its service offerings. We also have a positive view of the capital that the management allocated in developing a portfolio of early-stage property tech companies. These investments have provided an attractive return and have been strategically sound in the sense that they have often been accompanied by strategic partnerships and unique capabilities that have the potential to drive long-term growth for the company. These investments have better positioned the company to face the wave of change being driven through advances in technology, data, and artificial intelligence in the real estate service industry. We think that the companys capital return strategy is appropriate. The company has returned capital to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company also prefers to use excess capital for internal investments and acquisitions, which makes sense given the growth potential and the consolidation opportunities in the industry.We like JLLs corporate governance policies. Directors come from a wide variety of backgrounds, have different lengths of tenure, and are all independent except for CEO Christian Ulbrich. Ulbrich has been successful in identifying the emerging trends in the industry and positioning the company to benefit from secular tailwinds. For instance, we like managements focus on solutions related to digitization, data analytics, maintainability, and corporate outsourcing. Finally, we commend the management team for its talent management, which is paramount in the services-oriented business industry and is a particular area of strength for the company. In our opinion, management has done a decent job with capital allocation over the past several years and has maintained its market position and broadened the scope of services that it offers. It is still early days for some of the recent investments that the company has made and we would like to see more evidence of efficiency improvements, technology-driven innovation, and better implementation in certain geographical markets before we would consider a capital allocation rating of exemplary.","Jones Lang LaSalle provides a wide range of real estate-related services to owners, occupiers, and investors worldwide, including leasing, property and project management, and capital markets advisory. JLLs investment management arm, LaSalle Investment Management, manages over $70 billion for clients across diverse public and private real estate strategies.","Jones Lang LaSalle is in sound financial health. The company had net debt of $1.92 billion as of the end of the second quarter in 2023, resulting in a net debt/EBITDA ratio of about 2.3 times. The company is also in a comfortable position with respect to liquidity as it has a robust liquidity position of over $1.9 billion. This gives the company enough flexibility to pursue M&A, invest organically for long-term growth and to opportunistically buy back shares. Commercial real estate is highly cyclical in nature and suffers from significant volatility during downturns. Thus, we appreciate managements conservative approach toward leverage. This caution paid off during the coronavirus-induced recession, which had negatively dented profitability due to cratering investment volumes. With the companys cost of equity at around 9%, we think JLL could benefit from using a higher but still reasonable leverage level, resulting in a lower weighted average cost of capital, and ultimately benefiting its valuation. Given the cash flow generating capacity and the fundamental strength of JLLs business, we think the company could support slightly higher debt levels. Even at the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the company was able to maintain a gross debt/EBITDA ratio of around 1.4 times. As the company focuses on more recurring sources of revenue deriving from corporate outsourcing, we expect its ability to maintain more leverage to improve. Nevertheless, we think it is more prudent for management to err on the side of caution rather than take on too much debt, especially in the current macroeconomic environment.",JLL,Real Estate,7657809920.0,NYQ,217464.0,USD,155.24000549316406,True,1,151.54611888212472,178.22678987479014,1
24/11/2023,NRG Seeking New Leader Going Into 2024,NRG Energy Inc,NRG,2,20/11/2023,Travis Miller,45.83,USD,23/11/2023,38.0,High,,Standard,C,20/11/2023,"We are reaffirming our $38 per share fair value estimate for NRG Energy after the company announced CEO Mauricio Gutierrez has resigned among other management changes. We are reaffirming our no-moat rating and High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. Investment firm Elliott Management, which said it had a 13% economic interest in NRG in May, appears to have initiated the management changes. However, the timing seems odd given that NRG seems to have addressed many of Elliott's public complaints in May. The stock, up 42% since May, hit an all-time high last week, and now trades at a 25% premium to our fair value estimate. We think it's unlikely a new management team and board of directors will make substantial changes to NRG's strategic direction. Interim CEO Lawrence Coben said NRG would continue with the Vivint integration strategy, contrary to Elliott's urging to unwind the acquisition in May. We think it would be value-destructive for a new management team to unwind the deal at this point. The announcement comes two weeks after NRG reported what we considered impressive third-quarter results and a 2024 outlook that slightly exceeded our forecast. Along with the management changes, NRG reaffirmed management's 2023 and 2024 outlook, including its cost synergy and return of capital targets. We think it would be risky if a new management team tried to increase NRG's current plan to return $6.9 billion of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and the dividends. We continue to forecast $3.5 billion of EBITDA in 2026, including the Vivint synergies. Management's 2024 EBITDA guidance range is $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion. NRG's stock doubled during Elliott's last investment in NRG in 2017-18 after Gutierrez replaced ousted CEO David Crane and implemented Elliott's preferred simplification strategy. Elliott reported owning 4.6% of NRG, or 10.4 million shares, as of Sept. 30 but might have a larger economic interest through other entities or securities.","NRG's transformation in 2017-20 cut the business in half, improved its credit metrics, and generated substantial cash to use for the dividend, stock buybacks, and acquisitions like Direct Energy and Vivint. NRG's generation fleet provides a partial hedge for its retail supply business, helping stabilize consolidated earnings. NRG's primary operations are in Texas, which we think will have among the fastest electricity demand growth of any state during the next decade.","Federal and state environmental regulations and renewable energy goals could erode profitability at NRG's fossil-fuel power plants. The retail energy supply business is highly competitive with low margins, few barriers to entry, and minimal customer switching costs. Between large acquisitions, management turnover, and strategic changes, it has been difficult for investors to assess management's ability to create long-term value for shareholders.",20/11/2023,"NRG Energy has reconfigured its business, its management team, and its board of directors in the last few years. Once one of the largest power generators based mostly in Texas, NRG now is a nationwide retail energy and home services company. We estimate NRG's legacy power generation business will represent only about 20% of consolidated earnings on a runrate basis after its $5.2 billion Vivint Smart Home acquisition in March 2023 and $1.75 billion sale of its 44% interest in the South Texas Project nuclear plant in November 2023. The strategic shift picked up speed in 2020 when NRG acquired Direct Energy for $3.625 billion. It later sold most of its northeast power generation fleet and closed four Midwest power plants. These moves cut costs and strengthened its balance sheet ahead of the Vivint deal. NRG's focus on consumer-facing retail energy and home services changes its risk profile. A higher share of retail energy earnings helps offset the long-term threat to NRG's legacy fossil fuel generation fleet as renewable energy grows. However, the new direction leaves NRG more exposed to customer energy usage trends and volatility. NRG will benefit the most if electricity demand grows in its key markets. We expect electricity demand growth to pick up during the next decade, especially in Texas. Recent summer heat spells and Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 show that growing electricity demand can also create more energy price volatility and risk. Uri resulted in $1 billion of gross losses for NRG in just two weeks and could lead to energy market reforms. Apart from acquisitions, NRG has limited growth investment opportunities. We expect it to return most of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. NRG began shrinking its generation exposure in 2016. NRG divested half of its generation fleet, brought in nearly $3 billion of cash, and eliminated $10 billion of debt. In spring 2017, NRG sent subsidiary GenOn Energy into bankruptcy and in 2018, NRG sold its renewable energy business, its 47% stake in NRG Yield, and its South Central generation.","NRG's retail energy, power generation, and home services businesses do not have economic moats. Energy retailers sell commodity products such as electricity and natural gas. Customers enjoy virtually no switching costs, which makes for intensely competitive markets with tight and volatile margins. Economies of scale can boost returns as the retail business grows, but we think this is a fleeting source of competitive advantage.Few of NRG's power plants maintain a low-cost advantage that would be the foundation for establishing an economic moat in the commodity-sensitive merchant power industry. Shareholder returns for NRG's generation assets and retail businesses remain subject to volatile power and fuel commodity prices, as well as electricity demand trends. Many of NRG's plants are subject to intense local competition that can quickly erode any excess shareholder returns.NRG has proved that there are some benefits on a consolidated level by pairing its retail supply business with its wholesale generation in a given region, particularly in Texas, where the bulk of its wholesale generation fleet is located. This combination helped reduce earnings volatility and improve returns on capital for several years.However, the Direct Energy and Vivint acquisitions introduce NRG to new customer services and new retail markets outside Texas where it has no wholesale generation. NRG now serves substantially more retail load than its slimmed-down generation fleet can help serve, reducing the benefit of the retail-wholesale hedge. This limits NRG's ability to establish a low-cost advantage in the retail markets. We also expect few maintainable benefits from pairing the retail energy and home services businesses.","Management's strategic moves during the last few years have consolidated NRG's risk primarily in the Texas and eastern U.S. electricity and natural gas markets. Risks in NRG's growing retail energy and home services businesses include customer acquisition costs, churn, and cost-to-serve. These are much different than the operational and commodity market risks of the power generation business.We expect nationwide electricity demand to grow at a faster pace than in recent years, particularly in NRG's primary Texas market. We think this might attract retail energy competition. Long term, we expect NRG will have to steal market share to increase retail business earnings.Cross-selling Vivint's home services customers is one way NRG aims to gain share in the retail energy market. We don't expect significant growth in the home services market.In Texas, continued renewable energy growth could cut into NRG's wholesale generation earnings. In the eastern U.S., state and regional policymaking is the key risk. Policy developments in Texas and other markets following the February 2021 winter storm could raise costs and squeeze margins for retail energy suppliers like NRG.NRG's wholesale generation business is a nice hedge against its retail business, particularly in Texas. However, tight margins at the retail business offer little room for error when NRG prices customer contracts to incorporate volume and energy cost risk. Pairing the retail and wholesale businesses reduces retail risk slightly but not entirely, as the losses from Winter Storm Uri demonstrated.NRG also faces environmental, social, and governance risk, given its fossil fuel power generation fleet as regulators and politicians are embracing tighter carbon emissions policies. NRG is addressing this risk by retiring its coal plants and investing in clean energy such as utility-scale batteries and solar. We consider the impact from ESG factors in our moat rating and our cash flow forecasts.","We assign NRG a Standard Capital Allocation Rating.The 2023 Vivint acquisition and the 2021 Direct Energy acquisition mark NRG's third strategic transformation since December 2015. It's not clear whether NRG's focus on retail energy supply and home services will yield better returns for shareholders than NRG's previous strategic changes. Investors have been particularly skeptical of the Vivint acquisition.NRG used similar financing strategies for the Vivint and Direct Energy acquisitions. This involves adding substantial debt then using the cash flow from the new businesses to improve leverage metrics over a few years. With NRG's limited capital investment needs, the acquisitions were effectively alternatives to stock buybacks.Stock buybacks such as the $1 billion plan initiated in 2021 allow management to hit its 7%-9% annual per-share dividend growth target without allocating much incremental capital. As we expected, NRG in June 2023 upsized the 2021 share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion through 2025 and plans to direct 80% of cash flow, or some $6.9 billion, to share repurchases and dividends in 2023-27, assuming the Vivint integration goes as planned. The STP nuclear interest sale supports both the buyback plan and modest debt reduction.NRG is seeking a new CEO after Mauricio Gutierrez resigned in November 2023, seemingly under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management and others. Elliott built a 13% economic interest in early 2023 and pushed NRG to abandon the Vivint acquisition. That effort failed and NRG's stock hit an all-time high in November, but Elliott still sought a new CEO and four new directors. We expect the new CEO and directors will support Vivint and continue the integration.Gutierrez, NRG's former COO, had led NRG's simplification strategy after replacing ousted CEO David Crane in December 2015. Elliott and Bluescape Energy Partners together owned about 10% of the company in early 2017 and pushed the simplification strategy. Both sold most of their stakes by late 2018 booking a substantial gain as the stock more than doubled.The simplification transformation hit a bump when the 2021 Texas winter storm resulted in what we estimate was $2 per share of lost shareholder value. NRG then pivoted toward its current consumer-facing strategy capped by the Vivint acquisition.Crane was a dealmaker who diversified NRG into eastern U.S. wholesale generation and renewable energy after NRG exited bankruptcy in December 2003. He did very well for shareholders relative to other independent power producers. Unlike its peers, NRG bought back billions of dollars of stock during Crane's tenure and initiated a dividend even as power prices were falling.NRG's $1.7 billion acquisition of GenOn Energy in 2012 and $2.8 billion acquisition of Edison Mission in 2014 were good moves given their distressed pricing. We estimate that both deals ended up value-accretive, even considering GenOn's ultimate bankruptcy. The $287.5 million Reliant Energy acquisition in 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, has been a home run for investors.NRG under Crane also made a timely move in 2013 to monetize its some $6 billion of renewable energy investments by creating NRG Yield, now part of Clearway Energy. Until late 2015, NRG Energy shareholders had benefited by taking advantage of NRG Yield's much higher market valuation to monetize its contracted assets at a premium to book value. A drop in yieldco valuations in late 2015 made that trade less attractive.The 2012 GenOn acquisition was an intriguing turnabout. In 2006, Mirant, which merged into GenOn Energy, made a $7.9 billion all-stock offer for NRG, a 30% premium at the time, but Crane rejected it. Between May 2006 and NRG's GenOn acquisition offer in July 2012, Mirant shareholders lost 86% of their value, while NRG shareholders lost 28%. Crane also led NRG's effort to reject a $5.7 billion all-stock takeover bid from Exelon in mid-2008. We estimate this preserved $1.7 billion of shareholder value in the five years following the offer as Exelon's stock dropped far more than NRG's stock.","NRG Energy is one of the largest retail energy providers in the U.S., with 5.5 million customers. Its 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home adds 1.9 million home services customers. NRG also is one of the largest U.S. independent power producers, with 13 gigawatts of coal, gas, and oil power generation capacity primarily in Texas. NRG exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity in December 2003.","NRG's transformation that started in mid-2017 simplified its balance sheet, improved its credit metrics, and freed substantial capital to return to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.Management is targeting 2.5-2.75 times net debt/EBITDA, a level it reached in 2019 but might not reach again until at least 2025 following the Vivint deal and STP sale. The board doesn't seem to be in a rush to reduce leverage given it approved all-cash deals for Direct Energy and Vivint, raised the dividend to $1.20 per share from $0.12 in 2020, and initiated a $950 million accelerated share repurchase plan in late 2023.Lower capital expenditures should boost cash flow as NRG adjusts to maintenance levels at its core business. The retail business requires little capital investment. The $3 billion of cash proceeds from the renewable energy, NRG Yield, and South Central business sales helped NRG finance the Direct Energy acquisition with no new equity. STP sales proceeds will help reduce debt.Robust free cash flow and share buybacks should allow management to meet its 7%-9% dividend growth target easily. Management plans to buy back as much as $6.9 billion of stock between 2023-27, including authorization for $2.7 billion in 2023-25. We think the new CEO and directors will maintain these targets.Before the Direct Energy acquisition, NRG had cut its recourse debt below $6 billion and was on track to reach investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2020. Losses from the Texas winter storm in February 2021 and the all-cash Vivint acquisition added leverage that NRG plans to reduce.NRG carried $19.5 billion of consolidated debt at year-end 2015, including $7.9 billion of parent debt and the rest nonrecourse or project financing. The GenOn bankruptcy eliminated $2.7 billion of debt, and the 2018 divestitures eliminated $7 billion of debt.",NRG,Utilities,10920204288.0,NYQ,2934159.0,USD,45.83000183105469,True,0,39.52424002255294,52.94330629889629,1
24/11/2023,Solvay Still Has Work To Do in Reshaping Its Business Portfolio,Solvay SA,SOLB,4,03/11/2023,Rob Hales,104.25,EUR,23/11/2023,120.0,Medium,,Standard,,03/11/2023,"No-moat Solvay reported third-quarter EBITDA of EUR 702 million, 2.6% above the Vara consensus estimate, but down 18.5% organically over 2022, mostly as a result of reduced volumes across all segments. Still, on a 9-month basis, EBITDA was only down 1% organically compared with 2022, which has led management to reconfirm the full-year EBITDA guidance at the lower end of the prior range of EUR 2.9 billion to EUR 3.1 billion. Despite a 2% decline in the share price during intraday trading, we dont expect to materially change our EUR 120 fair value estimate for now. At current levels, the shares appear to be undervalued. All sectors felt the impact of reduced volumes, with the solutions segment experiencing the most significant downturn. In this category, EBITDA saw a substantial 31.7% reduction (negative 25.6% organically), primarily due to a sharp decline in Novecare sales, driven by diminished demand in agricultural, construction, and consumer markets. The materials segment was also hit, with a 15.8% decrease in EBITDA (or negative 12.4% organically) during third-quarter 2023. This decline was chiefly fueled by lower polymer sales, stemming from weaker performance across most markets compared with the previous year. In the chemicals sector, the impact was less severe, with EBITDA decreasing by 12.0% (negative 3.8% organically). This drop was mainly attributed to a substantial 23.9% decrease (negative 22.9% organically) in the sales of soda ash and derivatives. Reduced demand occurred across various markets, including construction, flat glass, and flue gas treatment. ","Solvay has a strong competitive position in the growing market for aerospace composites.  Acquisitions and divestitures in recent years have lowered the cyclicality of the business. Solvay is well positioned to benefit from megatrends, such as increasing wealth in emerging markets and the rising demand for energy-efficient products and solutions.","Despite Solvay's falling sales exposure to oil and gas, the industry continues to have a significant impact on the firm's financial performance. Solvay has high pension and environmental liabilities, which have a meaningful drag on cash flow. Current margins in the companys soda ash business will not be maintainable, as significant new industry capacity is expected to come on line in the next few years.",29/09/2022,"Belgium-based Solvay has made significant changes to its business portfolio over the past decade, but we think there is more work to do before its valuation will reflect a specialty chemical company. We don't see a moat, given that high capital intensity continues to weigh on returns on invested capital, leaving us with limited confidence in the company's ability to generate maintained returns above the cost of capital.  The company's sales are broadly diversified geographically and by end markets, although automotive and aerospace tend to take centre stage. Oil and gas is often topical, given Solvay's exposure to the highly cyclical U.S shale market. Sales are split fairly evenly among Europe, North America, and Asia.  Solvay's business is segmented into materials (33% of EBIT), chemicals (41% of EBIT), and solutions (26% of EBIT). Materials is the most attractive segment, given that it houses the moatworthy and high-growth specialty polymers and composite materials businesses. Chemicals is the legacy commodity chemical business, but this is by no means a weak link. Solvay is a leading global player in soda ash and peroxides, which generate significant cash for the company. Solutions is a mixed bag of businesses but in total is not earning the cost of capital. The Novecare surfactants business is the biggest component and targets diverse end markets. However, oil and gas appears to be still driving results, given its severe deterioration. Solvay is targeting mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, on average, between 2020 and 2024. The company also expects free cash flow conversion to exceed 30% and return on capital employed to exceed 11% by 2024. Investments will be focused in the materials segment, while the chemicals segment is run for maximum cash generation. Certain business in the solutions segment, notably oil and gas surfactants, will need to be restructured to improve returns.","We dont ascribe a moat to Solvay. Solvay has a wide variety of businesses in its portfolio with distinct products and competitive dynamics. We do think some of these businesses are moatworthy, particularly specialty polymers, peroxides, and composite materials, the last being obtained through the Cytec acquisition. However, high capital intensity dims our view for long-term value creation, and the high price paid for Cytec has saddled the capital base with goodwill. Given Solvay's active management of its portfolio of chemical businesses, we think goodwill should be incorporated into invested capital when assessing the potential for a moat. Solvay is the industry leader in high-performance specialty polymers (plastics), with by far the broadest product range. Tailor-made solutions are designed in collaboration with long-term customers, which results in pricing based on the value of the solution, rather than the product components. As a result, we think the business is earning high returns, owing to the switching costs associated with these long-term strategic partnerships with customers. The composite materials business is one of three major suppliers (Hexcel, Solvay, Toray) of aerospace carbon-fibre composites. Demand is growing from the need to reduce weight for fuel efficiency, but also owing to carbon fibres strength and corrosion-resistance properties, which result in lower maintenance costs. We think the qualification process for aerospace composite materials is a significant barrier to entry. Qualifying a new composite material for the aerospace industry can take 6-10 years and can cost EUR 50 million-100 million. Once qualified, aeroplane manufacturers have little incentive to consider alternative materials, and the qualified supplier is often the only source for the product. We believe the peroxides business has a cost advantage and intangible asset from its distinctive hydrogen peroxide megaplant technology. Solvay can build massive hydrogen peroxide plants that are used to provide the main feedstock to propylene oxide plants as part of the hydrogen peroxide to propylene oxide process. The HPPO process was developed by BASF and Dow as a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly way to produce propylene oxide. Only Solvay and Evonik have developed the technology (with each company having a different technology) to build these hydrogen peroxide megaplants, which are 3-4 times the size of a conventional plant, but Solvay controls around 70% of the market. As these plants require a huge investment and are largely beholden to a single customer, a respectable ROIC is essentially locked in through long-term take-or-pay agreements. Novecare is focused on surface chemistry, a highly competitive market in which all leading specialty chemical companies are active. Surface chemistry products alter the behaviour of fluids, giving them cleansing, moisturising, texturising, or dispersing properties, for example. The business serves a wide variety of end markets, such as home/personal care, agriculture, industrial coatings, and oil and gas. While tailored solutions form a big part of the offering to oil and gas and agriculture customers, overall we think too many products are standard ""off-the-shelf"" fare to earn a moat. Soda ash was the foundation of the company, formed some 150 years ago when Ernest Solvay invented the process to manufacture synthetic soda ash. About 50% of global soda ash production is used to make glass. As the bulk of glass demand is tied to the construction and automotive sectors, this is a cyclical business. The company remains the largest producer in the world, with roughly 35% of European capacity and 20% of North American capacity. There are two methods for producing soda ash: the natural process and the synthetic process. The natural process is more cost-effective. However, it requires access to a trona deposit, and global resources are largely concentrated in the United States and Turkey. Solvays U.S. production, which uses the natural method, sits near the bottom of the global cost curve, while its European production, which uses the synthetic method, sits more in the middle of the cost curve. On a regional basis, Solvays cost position is on par with other producers in the U.S. In Europe, its cost position is higher than natural production from Turkey, but a portion of its production base is below other European synthetic producers. Consequently, while we believe Solvay has a strong competitive position, we are not convinced that a durable cost advantage is evident.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Solvay is Medium. The company's acquisitions and divestitures in recent years have increased its exposure to the specialty end of the chemicals spectrum and have therefore lessened the cyclicality of the consolidated company. This is supported by wide geographical and end-market diversity, with no significant customer concentration at the group level. However, its performance chemicals segment contains mostly commoditised businesses with high operating leverage, which will continue to amplify financial performance along with the business cycle. In addition, the performance chemicals segment tends to have a more concentrated customer base, with several products having at least one customer representing more than 10% of sales. The chemicals sector is generally capital-intensive, and production facilities can take three to six years to mature after the initial investment. As a result, demand expected at the time capital was committed may not be there when the production facility is complete. Solvay uses significant amounts of energy and raw materials. The price of such materials is largely out of Solvays control and may not be passed through to customers in a timely manner.Like most chemical firms, Solvay's environmental, social, and governance risks are mainly related to production, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions of wastewater and air pollutants. Regulatory changes could increase operating costs, require capital investments to meet new standards, or increase liability risks resulting in fines.Several of Solvay's previous business activities have left the company on the hook for environmental remediation costs, which are currently in excess of EUR 0.5 billion. We include these provisions in our base case. The risk of higher-than-expected costs is included in our Uncertainty Rating. The company also faces litigation risks related to polyfluoroalkyl substances.","Solvay has a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation rating based on our assessments of the balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions. The balance sheet is sound. Solvay has high business risk due to its high cyclicality, but this is offset by it conservative use of debt. Moreover, a significant portion of the debt is hybrid bonds, which are subordinated and have perpetual maturity dates. We rate investments as fair. Historically, we think the strategy around acquisitions has been solid but the prices paid have been expensive. This view is supported by the recent impairment charges taken on the assets acquired with Cytec in 2015. Going forward, we are optimistic that acquisition activity will be more disciplined and we are constructive on the restructuring plan of the current portfolio, which should lead to improving economic profits. We think shareholder distributions are appropriate. The company allocates a relatively high amount of cash flow to the dividend, which reflects the maturity of the business. Share buybacks are rarely used and therefore unlikely to have an impact.","Solvay is a Belgium-based producer of chemicals, plastics, and composites. The company has a top-three market position for nearly all of its products. Key business segments include materials, chemicals, and solutions. High-value products include aerospace composites and specialty polymers while traditional chemical products include soda ash and hydrogen peroxide. Geographical exposure is relatively balanced, with Europe, North America, and Asia each contributing a third of sales.","Solvay is in good financial health. Our model-driven credit risk assessment is moderate. The company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which is currently in place. Underlying net financial debt was EUR 4.0 billion in 2021, which equates to Solvay's leverage ratio (net debt plus hybrid bonds/EBITDA) being 1.7 times. Including the pension deficit, the ratio increases to a slightly high 2.2 times, but it is not at a point where we would be concerned. Debt maturities are balanced. A large portion of the debt is hybrid bonds, which are subordinated and have a perpetual maturity date.",SOLB.BR,Basic Materials,11286178816.0,BRU,23518.0,EUR,103.5500030517578,True,1,19.296456808327584,23.628831105062652,0
24/11/2023,Asahis Premiumization Strategy Remains Intact Over the Long Run; Geopolitical Tension Is a Risk,Asahi Group Holdings Ltd,2502,4,16/11/2023,Jeanie Chen,5509.0,JPY,24/11/2023,6600.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,16/11/2023,"Asahi Group Holdings announced after the market closed on Nov. 16 that it will conduct a secondary offering, equivalent to 6.6% of its outstanding shares, overseas. The shares to be sold are owned by eight financial institutions, which have been holding Asahis shares for a cross-shareholding, as well as the pension fund of Mizuho Banks employees. While the secondary offering is likely to weigh on Asahis near-term share price, we believe unwinding the cross-shareholding is positive for Asahis corporate governance and shareholder structure over the long run. The timing of the unwinding also indicates managements confidence in the firms growth prospects and future share performance. We reiterate our investment thesis that Asahi will be the key beneficiary of Japans tax reforms, which will prompt consumers to trade up to beers from cheaper beer-like alternatives. The shares are trading at a 12% discount to our fair value estimate of JPY 6,600. Asahi is the second firm, after Ajinomoto, that announced the secondary offering, caused by the unwinding of the cross-shareholding this week. Unlike Ajinomoto which chose to buy back up to JPY 40 billion of shares and offer the rest to the domestic investors, Asahi will sell all the shares to overseas institutional investors. It is clear that a share buyback is not an option for Asahi because it remains on a path to reduce the debt burden and improve financial health after paying $11 billion for Carlton & United Breweries in 2020. The offer price will be based on the closing price between Nov. 28. and Dec. 1 multiplied by a factor between 0.9 and 1. Unwindingthe cross-shareholding has been an ongoing process for Japanese financial institutions, which need to reduce their cross-shareholding stake to meet the Basel capital requirements in the future. We reckon that the share performance and managements stance toward the target firms played critical roles in the financial institutions unwinding decision.","The premiumization trend is not undermined by inflation in the western markets despite geopolitical uncertainty which may trigger another surge in commodity prices.  There is ample room for Asahi to cross-sell premium beer brands, including Super Dry and European names, by leveraging existing distribution channels in Asia, Europe and Australia. The domestic on-premise beer volume will recover to the pre-COVID-19 level when companies implement more strict return-to-the-office policies and demand for banquets and parties further rebound in Japan.","Heightened geopolitical uncertainty might trigger another round of inflation and raise the likelihood of recession, especially in Europe does not bode well for Asahis premiumization strategy and the near-term profit outlook. Cost inflation will continue to weigh on Asahis profits in 2024 given the time lag between market prices and impacts on costs as well as a weak yen, despite sizable correction in commodity prices from the recent peak. Growth driven by premiumization will stall after several rounds of price hikes while the volume contraction of beers will constrain profit growth.",13/11/2023,"Asahi is pinning its hopes on premiumization and global expansion to reinvigorate growth. The acquisition of SABMillers brands in Europe is a key stepping-stone to establishing its presence in the global premium beer market. Concurrently, the group intends to enhance profitability by rationalizing cost structure through supply chain optimization. Management has a proven record of cost-cutting. Whether it can continue a mid- to high-single-digit profit growth rate will depend on continued expansion of the premium offerings amid difficult economic conditions and the commodity prices of the key input. Unlike rival Kirin, which is looking for new revenue sources outside the shrinking beer market, Asahi is determined to stick to its core business. Asahi is targeting opportunities in the premium beer category not only because of the ongoing premiumization trend globally, but also because the strategic direction bodes well for its strengths in Asahi Super Dry, the number-one beer brand in Japan.  Premiumization will remain the groups growth engine and efforts are extended to not only beers but the adjacent categories including low and no-alcohol beverages. Despite inflation headwinds, Asahi has doubled down on brand investment, entering sports sponsorships to support the global expansion initiatives which will reinforce premiumization endeavors. Super Dry is the official partner of 2023 Rugby World Cup while Peroni, the Italian beer brand, will become Ferraris F1 sponsor from 2024. In light of the moderate drinking trends, Asahi has stepped up offerings of non-alcoholic beverages and low-alcohol beers in three core markets, namely Japan, Europe, and Oceania, by leveraging its know-how in soft beverages.  In Asahis home market, where the firm holds more than 45% beer volume share, liquor tax reform narrowing the price gap between beer and beer-like products continues to boost demand for regular beer, which could materially improve Asahis long-term profitability. Despite a focus on the premium segment, Asahi is less keen on entering the craft market. It prefers to concentrate on the existing brands unless craft beer emerges as a prominent category in Japan. ","Asahi earns a narrow moat, in our view, for its cost advantage and intangible assets in the brewing businesses. Scale combined with concentration in share, roughly 30%-40%, in its core operating markets, contributes to Asahis cost-competitiveness in the beer business. The cost advantage enables marketing investment and product innovations to strengthen brand equity and entrench relationships with retailers and restaurants.Scale in the individual operating markets is critical to brewers cost-competitiveness, given the capital-intensive characteristics requiring heavy up-front investment in plants and brewing equipment. Given that input costs, mainly raw materials and packaging, do not vary significantly among major players, while depreciation and shipping costs account for a relatively sizable portion in the brewers cost structure, Asahis scale contributes to its operational efficiency. Asahi operates six brewing factories, compared with nine at Kirin and eight at Sapporo, while its volume share is comparable to Kirins and three times that of Sapporo. It has shut down two domestic brewing factories in early 2023 and plans to relocate the one in the south to a new hybrid factory producing alcoholic and soft beverages in 2026 to streamline its domestic supply chain.Despite a mere 3.1% volume share globally, Asahi generates an estimated JPY 5,120 (EUR 41) EBITDA per hectoliter in Japan and JPY 2,620 (EUR 20.5) per hectoliter in Europe, compared with Anheuser-Busch InBevs EUR 28, Heinekens EUR 22, and Carlsbergs EUR 13. The high profitability on the volume base earned in Japan is attributable to Asahis dominant share in the beer category (equivalent to the mainstream/premium segments in global markets) and partly owing to higher selling prices of mainstream beer products. Unlike the global beer markets in which product segments are simply defined by pricing points, Japans market segmentation, categorized by beer, happoshu (low malt), and new genre (no malt), is defined by the level of malt content. As excise taxes vary by the malt content (, the malt content is one of the key parameters other than production costs to set product prices. Asahi has an estimated 45% volume share in the so-called beer category in Japan dominated by its Super Dry brand, which claims about 40%-plus of the category volume as of 2022.The acquired European business from SAB Miller also enjoys a scale in Central Europe of which it holds a leading market share, ranging between 31% and 48%, in Czech Republic, Romania, and Poland and enjoys a strong presence in the premium segment. Asahi sees upside to expand its premium exposure by increasing sales of Peroni and Grolsch, the premium brands acquired in Western Europe, as well as Super Dry. Given that premium beer drinkers who often earn above-average income tend to be less price-sensitive, demand for premium beer is more resilient to economic downturns. The premium segment saw volume recover quickly after the economic downturn in 2008. Moreover, the large consumption per capita in its core markets in the region also suggests beer is considered a habitual necessity and thus more likely to see stable sales. Czech Republic tops the per capita consumption list while Poland and Romania come in fourth and fifth. Per capita consumption in the Czech Republic is nearly twice that of Romania and 5.5 times that of Japan.Scale also enables marketing investment in brands, new products, and channel relationships. Super Dry immediately became a blockbuster after its launch in 1987 thanks to product innovations and effective marketing, allowing Asahi to continuously reinvest in brand-building and gain share for more than a decade through 1990s. The karaguchi taste, meaning a dry crisp taste with a clean finish, was novel to consumers when heavy, thick lager beer was the mainstream. Despite rivals efforts to launch similar products, they failed to imitate the taste and take share.The size of Asahis marketing investment is nearly 3 times that of fourth-largest player Sapporo. Given that the number of product lines and brands across the broader beer categories are similar among all the major Japanese brewers, the size of marketing budget suggests Asahi has more resources to fend off rivals who attempt to gain shares in the saturated home market or nurture new products/ brands in its portfolio. It also supports investment in the on-premise outlets, which constituted 46% of Japans total beer volume consumption before COVID-19. Because of limited space, most of the Japanese restaurants/bars provide only one kind of draft beer although they might serve many other brands in bottles. Therefore, an up-front rebate is required for being an exclusive vendor. Asahi supply around 260 thousand restaurants/bars with Super Dry draft beer, mostly as an exclusive vendor, in Japan. The on-premises channel made up more than 40% of Asahis regular beer sales pre-COVID-19 (about 30% as of 2022).","We assign Asahi a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium.Major risks facing Asahi include economic downturns, regulatory changes, and tax hikes. As demand for premium beer is highly susceptible to disposable income and consumer confidence, Asahis focus on the premium segment, specifically in Europe, exposes itself to greater risks of the regions economic weakness. Despite potential recession, management believes premiumization remains a long-term trend in the global beer market and the history suggests that the volume contraction or downtrading does not dwell.Japans unfavorable demographics continue to pose threat to its lucrative beer business. Increased options with various types of alcoholic drinks, falling alcohol consumption among Japans millennials in part due to health concerns, and a preference for RTD offering a smooth, refreshing taste are attributable to a decrease in beer consumption. Regulatory changes, often related to alcohol taxes, could lead to noticeable changes in prices or emergence of new product categories, causing a shift in consumer preferences, particularly in Japan. For example, tax hikes on low-malt beer (happoshu) in Japan prompted brewers to develop new no-malt beers (new genre), which caused volume of happoshu to shrink to one fourth of the peak level. Likewise, recent tax hikes on new genre have triggered consumers shift to regular beers which benefit from tax cuts.While brewers raw material costs are usually relatively stable compared with those of processed food peers, Asahi is unable to escape from impacts of rapid surge in commodity prices. Specifically, packaging and transportation are the two cost items with meaningful portions in its cost structure. Currency fluctuations could also have material impacts on Asahis earnings as the overseas operations, mainly in Central and Western Europe as well as Australia, contribute about 60% of the groups profits.","We rate Asahis Capital Allocation as Standard for a weak balance sheet, exceptional investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. The JPY 2.3 trillion investment in three large acquisitions, including CUB in 2020 and SABMillers Western and Central Europe operations in 2016 and 2017, stretched Asahis balance sheet greatly. The net debt/EBITDA soared to nearly 7 times in 2020, which we estimate to fall to about 3.2 times in 2024 when the impact of COVID-19 dissipates. Likewise, interest coverage fell to 23 times EBITDA/interest after the CUB acquisition and we project the ratio will rise to 35 times by 2025. Management initially intended to lower the net debt/EBITDA ratio to 3 times by the end of 2022, but the target is likely to be delayed by at least two years as a result of COVID-19, in our view. We expect Asahi to repay JPY 370 billion between 2022 and 2025, backed by an average of JPY 200 billion in free cash flow (excluding mergers and acquisitions) generated annually. Our estimates indicate that net debt/EBITDA will fall below 3 times in 2025.We assess Asahis investment records as exceptional. Asahis management has a proven record of delivering financial promises to the market, thanks to highly rigorous cost controls and agile execution. It has also delivered positive returns on most of its investment/acquisition decisions. While it stands out among the domestic peers, we consider it on par with global players.There are some traits of Asahis investment strategies attributable to the successful outcomes. First, Asahi tends to buy or invest in companies/businesses with leading market shares in their core markets. It is particularly notable outside the beer category. The three key brands--Wakodo (baby foods), Mintia (breath mints), and Amano (freeze-dried foods)--of its domestic food business are the category leaders in Japan. Second, Asahi grants autonomy to employees of the acquired companies and promotes the outperformers. The former regional head of SABMillers Western and Central Europe became the CEO of Asahis European operation while a senior director of Calpis was promoted to lead Asahis soft drink business. Finally, some of the acquired companies or equity affiliates were Asahis partners. For example, Asahi had formed joint ventures with Qingdao Beer and Master Kongs beverage business before it took a stake in both firms. After spending JPY 1.2 trillion on the SABMiller deals and having decided to focus on the premium beer expansion, Asahi started selling joint ventures overseas, mainly in Asia. It sold the stake in Qingdao Beer and Tingyi-Asahi Beverage (China) as well as the Indonesian beverage joint venture with Indofood. It also sold the domestic beverage subsidiary Elbee and the stake in Kagome, the largest Japanese manufacturer of tomato-based products. The JPY 1.1 trillion CUB deal completed during the pandemic without renegotiation was somewhat disputable given a sharp drop in on-trade volume, but the surprising recovery proves a limited downside risk. Apart from selling the cider business and two beer brands owned by CUB to Heineken, management has been divesting some domestic noncore assets to improve cash flow. We consider the shareholder distribution appropriate. Management made some notable progress in returns to shareholders as well as corporate governance in 2019. It has lifted the payout ratio to 35% in 2021 and aims for a 40% payout by 2025. Meanwhile, it has removed management responsibilities from the chairman, who focuses solely on the supervision role. The share repurchase programs, which have been halted since 2016 after it significantly increased leverage to finance the acquisition deals, are unlikely to be resumed until its financial health strengthens. Debt repayment will be a priority for the use of cash over the next two to three years, in our view.","Asahi is a leading brewer in Japan with an estimated 36.5% market share by volume in Japans beer and beer-like market, led by its Asahi Super Dry beer brand. It also operates a wide range of acholic and soft beverage products as well as packaged foods, mainly in Japan. It has made inroads into Europe through acquisitions of SABMillers brands including Peroni and Pilsner Urquell in Western and Central Europe in 2016 and 2017. The acquisition of Carlton United Breweries has granted Asahi the leading market share in Australias beer market with Great Northern the leading brand. East Asia including China and Southeast Asia are the other overseas markets where Asahi is growing. Overseas business represents nearly half of the group sales and 60% of business profits.","Asahis leverage has risen considerably after three large acquisitions including CUB in 2020 and SABMillers Western and Central Europe operations in 2016 and 2017. The net debt/EBITDA soared to nearly 7 times in 2020, which we estimate to fall to about 3.2 times in 2024 when the impact of COVID-19 dissipates. Likewise, interest coverage dropped to 23 times EBITDA/interest in 2020 and we project the ratio to rebound to 32 times by 2025, the end of our explicit forecast period. Management initially intended to lower the net debt/ EBITDA ratio to 3 times by the end of 2022, but the target is likely to be delayed by two years as a result of COVID-19. We expect Asahi to repay JPY 600 billion between 2021 and 2024, backed by an average of JPY 200 billion in free cash flow (excluding mergers and acquisitions) generated annually. Our estimates indicate that net debt/EBITDA will drop to below 3 times around 2025.Investment in growth including acquisitions remains Asahis top priority. Given Asahis debt level, the bolt-on acquisitions targeting small and midsize brewers with strong local brands and distribution are most likely. While it will remain in search of acquisition opportunities in the global premium beer space, we do not expect new deals until the financial health improves. Capital expenditure is expected to rise by more than 20% year on year in 2023 to JPY 120 billion on a cash basis in part due to yen weakness and increased investment in digital transformation, R&D, and sustainable initiatives. We project capital expenditure to stay around JPY 120 billion annually through the rest of the five-year explicit forecast period given streamlining of the Japan supplier chain, integration of the Australian brewery business, and managements ambition to reduce CO2 emission by 70% by 2030 through increased employment of clean energy.",2502.T,Consumer Defensive,2756807753728.0,JPX,2420500.0,JPY,5509.0,True,1,5509.639666301458,5395.279581190664,0
24/11/2023,TJX Value Proposition Benefiting From Consumer Caution in the Full-Price Channel,TJX Companies Inc,TJX,2,15/11/2023,Jaime Katz,89.95,USD,23/11/2023,73.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,15/11/2023,"We believe TJXs stellar fiscal 2024 third-quarter marks testify to its ability to navigate the tough macroenvironment, thanks to its high-quality value offerings and scavenger hunt shopping experience. During the quarter, TJX saw 9% top-line growth, to $13.3 billion, and a 12% pretax profit margin (up 80 basis points annually on higher sales and benefit from expense timing), outpacing our $12.9 billion and 11.3% preprint estimates, respectively. Still, the updated fourth-quarter outlook of 10.4%-10.6% pretax profit margin (from 10.7%-10.9% prior) and reiterated 3%-4% comparable sales imply more margin pressure than previously anticipated due to higher expenses. In aggregate, this should lead to a modest lift in our outlook for sales of $54 billion and EPS of $3.66, which will bring us in line with updated full-year guidance for 4%-5% comps and $3.71-$3.74 in EPS. As such, we dont plan a material change to our $73 fair value estimate. Shares still strike us as rich at a 20%-plus premium, even after a 3% drop after the print. Unpacking the quarter, strength was seen across categories (apparel and home) and income demographics, with all TJXs banners posting positive comps entirely driven by increased traffic. Marmaxx and HomeGoods (61% and 17% of sales, respectively) were bright spots, as comps each jumped 7% and 9% as its fresh, value-priced assortments continue to attract bargain-seeking customers amid an unsettled economic backdrop. In this context, we believe TJX is uniquely positioned to operate well in a challenging environment (where we typically see softening demand in discretionary categories in which TJX plays) due to its flexible inventory sourcing approach, value proposition, and strategic vendor relationships that underpin our narrow moat rating. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our long-term prospects for the business, and we view our mid-single-digit average annual sales growth and low-double-digit pretax profit margins as attainable.","With an agile merchandising and distribution network, TJX keeps inventory fresh, spurring traffic while minimizing risks associated with fashion trends and freeing capital. We believe digital retailers will have a more difficult time encroaching on the off-price channel, considering the sector's already-low prices and vendors' demand for discretion. TJX's international operations should offer ample runway for growth and associated incremental cost leverage, with the store banners and off-price concept translating well abroad.","Inflation and economic uncertainty pose many near-term challenges as TJX works to navigate shifting spending patterns. Competition in retail is fierce, necessitating continued investment in the stores and low prices to maintain traffic. Digital retailers have struggled to usurp TJX's off-price strength, but their efforts to build cost leverage, ease returns, and price even more aggressively could create strain, and the pandemic provide an accelerated adoption.",17/08/2023,"Despite ongoing inflation and an unsettled economy, we believe TJX and the rest of the off-price sector are better suited than most retailers, with potential for improved merchandise availability as shifting spending patterns upset full-price stores merchandise orders. We still believe TJX and its peers benefit from durable advantages over full-price apparel and home dcor sellers, with strong brands, store experiences, and scale working to keep returns on invested capital high (averaging 30% over the next decade). TJX's value proposition should resonate even as retail competition intensifies. While digital retailers are a factor (particularly if the pandemic durably increases e-commerce adoption), we see the off-price channel as relatively well protected, as the low-frills buying experience and 20%-60% discounts relative to the full-price channel result in competitive prices and superior economics after considering shipping and return costs. Vendors desire for discretion also favors physical stores that can discreetly sell merchandise without diluting top brands cachet. With a global presence, TJX leverages an extensive merchandising operation and proprietary inventory management system to maintain a fast-changing assortment at significant discounts. We believe TJX's ability to deliver a high-value lineup while maintaining strong returns is driven by its difficult-to-replicate sourcing and distribution agility. By accepting incomplete assortments without return privileges, paying promptly, and stocking brands discreetly (preserving labels' conventional-channel pricing power by avoiding the stigma of a consistent discount presence), TJX is a valued partner for its more than 21,000 vendors, in our view. As a result, TJX can opportunistically offer a fast-changing, high-value assortment in a treasure-hunt format that is difficult to replicate digitally.","We assign TJX a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets (including a proprietary inventory management system and strong vendor relationships) and a cost advantage. The company's long history of financial performance is consistent with our assessment, with adjusted returns on invested capital averaging 22% over the last decade, well above our 9% weighted average cost of capital estimate. Furthermore, the company's 24-year streak of positive comparable-store sales growth leading up to the pandemic (with only one year other than fiscal 2021 with a decline in its more than 40-year history) overlapped a variety of economic and competitive environments, including the financial crisis and ensuing recession, giving us confidence in its business model's appeal to customers under a variety of business cycle scenarios. We expect economic profits to build as conditions normalize, with our 10-year average estimate of adjusted return on invested capital at 30%.The full-price retail channel (particularly department stores) sells an assortment of apparel from a relatively stable roster of brands, ordered well in advance and in large quantities. Retailers and manufacturers work together to ensure ample supply, with stores motivated through advertising or markdown allowances to ensure inventory clears, delivery concessions, and return privileges for excess merchandise. TJX's business model differs considerably. The firm uses a far more flexible inventory sourcing approach, relying on a team of over 1,200 buyers sourcing products from over 21,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. The company attempts to be the retailer of choice for vendors (generally manufacturers) looking to sell excess brand-name merchandise quickly. TJX accomplishes this by dispensing with retail, promotional, and delivery concessions as well as return rights, all while paying promptly (payable days around 35 in a normalized environment, versus 110-120 for Macy's) and buying opportunistically, including in less-than-full assortments and with less than a full complement of sizes. In exchange, TJX secures products at lower prices that allow it to undercut full-price retailers by 20%-60%, capitalizing on its significant bargaining power with suppliers.The company's business model is enabled by a flexible store and distribution architecture as well as a customer value proposition that focuses on the in-store treasure hunt. TJX's assortment is rapidly changing, with brands and items rotating based on availability. This encourages bargain-seeking customers to visit the stores frequently, spurring traffic and repeat store visits that are further stimulated by the firm's loyalty program. The reputation for flexibility and a volatile assortment allows TJX to be opportunistic, with loosely defined departments that can expand and contract as demand and product availability warrant. The stores provide an ideal venue for monetizing the companys vendor relationships, which enable TJX to serve as a partner of choice for vendors who rely on it to clear inventory quickly and with minimal risk. The relationships and customer experience feed on each other, with TJX's vendor relationships enabling a low-cost, high-value branded assortment that draws customers, traffic that adds to TJX's value to its suppliers.We anticipate TJX will continue to have the pick of a large pool of attractive inventory. The volatile retail environment and fickle customer tastes make demand forecasting challenging for manufacturers and retailers alike, with demand projections often overly optimistic (a dynamic that has only become more pronounced as digital retailers proliferate). Product availability has been more than adequate for decades, and we expect the company's scale to give it access to the most attractive opportunities as its long history and established, national presence attract vendors. TJX's fast inventory turnover (around 6 times in fiscal 2023, about double Macy's and about the same as Target's despite the latter's food lineup, which is faster-turning merchandise) limits the damage caused by misidentification of trends, and the firm's financial scale allows it to opportunistically buy excess inventory for use in later seasons (packaway) to match demand with attractively priced supply. Although off-price retailers have not been immune to rising freight and labor costs, we believe full-price shipment delays and rapidly changing consumer spending patterns should result in exceptional near-term buying opportunities for off-price merchants, and expect rising prices to focus customer attention on value.TJX also offers vendors the opportunity to sell excess inventory of designer merchandise discreetly, which is important for manufacturers looking to maintain their brands' cachet by avoiding being seen as a discount label. The company does not expect to maintain a steady inventory of a particular item or brand; as a result, manufacturers avoid the stigma of being a regular, featured presence in an off-price store. Rather than advertise the brands it stocks, TJX's marketing focuses on the store banners themselves, and customers are largely left to find the labels they desire on their own as part of the treasure-hunt experience. In this way, TJX's standing with customers reinforces itself by making the firm a more attractive partner for vendors, allowing the retailer to acquire better merchandise and provide greater values in store. We contend that the apparel retail sector offers few opportunities for firms to develop a durable competitive advantage, in part because we have long held that consumers generally look to product brands rather than the retailer's marquee. TJX's approach also addresses this challenge by featuring the store experience (a rapidly changing assortment of brand-name products at attractive prices) in its advertising rather than the labels sold.TJX's scale allows it to leverage a number of costs over a broad sales base, including advertising, merchandising, supply chain, and distribution expenditures. Furthermore, its size allows TJX to create significant insights from its customer data, enhanced by its loyalty program, TJX Rewards. We believe the company's international operations enhance its cost standing; while fashion trends differ sharply across borders, TJX's geographic dispersion makes it a more valuable partner to multinational vendors that face excess inventory issues across all of their operating areas, even if the specific items differ.Despite TJX's history of performance, we think the firm's competitive advantages fall short of earning a wide economic moat rating. While we believe that TJX should be able to comfortably generate economic returns over the next decade, the years beyond that point carry increasing risk as digital retailers develop additional distribution scale (leveraging shipping costs), make returns easier, and use technology (such as virtual and augmented reality) to ensure customers receive products that fit and are in line with their aesthetic preferences.","We assign TJX a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.TJX faces an unsettled landscape amid economic uncertainty. Inflation can pressure discretionary income, although unemployment remains low and an increasing focus on value should favor off-price stores. Supply chain disruptions can create near-term costs while potentially improving product availability. Over the longer term, intense competition in a sector with negligible switching costs constitutes the main threat to our outlook.TJX has long delivered sales growth in myriad market conditions. However, the pace of change in retail is brisk, with upheaval coming as digital retailers develop distribution and supply chain scale, physical sellers attempt to keep pace through aggressive cost control and pricing, and manufacturers increasingly sell directly to customers. We believe the motivations that lead vendors to sell desirable product at attractive terms to TJX will remain intact (particularly as the new channels make demand forecasting challenging) and that customers will continue to respond to the values offered. However, results could deviate from this expectation, possibly a result of competitive encroachment on the off-price segment or improved production forecasting technology, or conversely a greater-than-anticipated shift from traditional physical retail into the off-price sector (as the lack of switching costs cuts both ways).We see few environmental, social, or governance risks, mostly concentrated in the management of a global workforce in varying jurisdictions. While the apparel manufacturing industry can draw scrutiny regarding its labor practices, we see the risk largely confined to producers; furthermore, TJXs assortment is drawn from thousands of suppliers.","We assign the company a Standard Morningstar capital allocation rating.Under CEO Ernie Herrman, who took the helm in 2016, TJX has continued to feature a sound balance sheet, with a conservative approach to leverage that has left it in a net cash position each year over the last decade. We applaud managements prudence and expect funds generated from operations can support continued outlays in service of international and home store expansion and share repurchases.TJXs investment record is fair, with the company deploying resources to expand its store footprint. Expansion in established TJX markets like the United States adds to store density, which we believe is positive as it allows for greater leverage over distribution, supply chain, and advertising costs while making the company more valuable to vendors. Additionally, the Homesense introduction in the United States adds new but adjacent categories (furniture) that should bolster the chains off-price strength in home fashions without diluting the HomeGoods brand. Internationally, TJX has worked to add density as well as build a presence in new geographies, which we expect to continue. We had a cautiously favorable view of its purchase of a 25% stake in Familia, Russias lone sizable off-price apparel and home goods seller, for $225 million, as the off-price concept has proven appeal abroad (including in nearby Poland, where TJX has had a presence for 10 years), and the minority structure allowed management to limit risk as it explored a market with political and regulatory conditions that can charitably be described as challenging. The companys move to sell the stake in the wake of Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine is not surprising and should not have a material economic impact. The firm has taken a measured approach to e-commerce globally; we see this approach as wise, considering the off-price sectors resistance to digitization.TJXs shareholder distributions have largely been appropriate and have not come at the expense of continued investment in its capabilities. The organization has generally repurchased shares at levels near or below our valuation, though buybacks have periodically come at premiums. TJX steadily raised its dividend in the years before the pandemic (with payouts growing at a 22% compounded annual rate from fiscal 2011 to 2020, to nearly 35% of earnings); we see the payouts as reasonable considering the companys ongoing growth aspirations.","TJX is a leading off-price retailer of apparel, home fashions, and other merchandise. It sells a variety of branded goods, opportunistically buying inventory from a network of over 21,000 vendors worldwide. TJX targets undercutting conventional retailers' regular prices by 20%-60%, capitalizing on a flexible merchandising network, low-frills stores, and a treasure-hunt shopping experience to drive margins and inventory turnover. TJX derived 77% of fiscal 2023 revenue from the United States, with 12% from Europe (mostly the United Kingdom and Germany), 10% from Canada, and the remainder from Australia. The company operated more than 4,800 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 under the T.J. Maxx, T.K. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, Homesense, and Sierra banners.","TJX's financial health is sound, with $4.6 billion of cash against $2.9 billion of total debt at the end of July 2023. The firm has a historically conservative approach to debt that we do not expect to change. With cash flow to the firm averaging 7% of sales over the last five years and a similar mark expected of the next decade, we do not foresee much need for outside funding.Management states that its maximum store count potential is 3,000 units at Marmaxx (from 2,482 at the end of fiscal 2023), 1,500 at HomeGoods (from 940), 650 in Canada (from 554), and 1,125 in its existing other international markets (from 781). We expect it will take about 10 years to approach these targets, with TJX likely adding new international markets in that time. We anticipate TJX will continue to favor leasing stores, though store expansion should remain its capital priority. We expect capital expenditures to account for 2%-3% of sales long term.TJX has returned capital via share buybacks and dividends. We assume about 45% of annual operating cash flow is returned to investors through repurchases long term, and that the dividend payout ratio remains near fiscal 2020s 34% (before the pandemic), at around 40%.

We maintain our fair value estimates of HKD 3.5 per H share (CNY 3.1 per A share) for BOC, HKD 3.6 per H share (CNY 3.3 per A share) for CMBC, and CNY 32 per A share for BONB. The first nine-month results reflect less net interest margin, or NIM, pressures than peers, which contracted 13, 14, and 10 basis points, respectively, for BOC, CMBC, and BONB. BOCs NIM performance was slightly stronger than expected, only declining 3 basis points from the first halfs level. We suspect this was mainly attributable to the rising NIM trend as seen in its subsidiary, BOC Hong Kong, which reported a 36-basis-point year-on-year increase for the first nine months, with third-quarter NIM further increased 10 basis points from the second quarter. We expect BOC Hong Kongs favorable NIM trend to continue to buffer against downward pressures in BOCs domestic RMB business in 2023 and the first half of 2024. But the benefit should taper off from second quarter of 2024 onward on higher base, rising deposit competition, and falling rates if the Fed starts cutting rates. On the contrary, we expect BONB to face greater NIM headwinds in coming quarters. Cumulative nine-month NIM declined 10 basis points year on year to 1.89%, or contracting 4 basis points from the first halfs level. The bank saw greater-than-peer volatility in NIM in the past two years due to shorter average asset duration. We expect wider year-on-year NIM contraction for full-year 2023 and early 2024 due to unfavorable base and higher interest rate sensitivity of its SME lending. Though CMBC outperformed peers with a flat NIM from the first halfs level at 1.48%, this was mainly attributable to a low base in 2022 that saw a 31-basis-point decline year on year. Instead of the favorable NIM trend, we believe the market is more concerned about CMBCs property lending risks.","Leveraging first-mover advantage and a high-quality customer base, BOC dominates the cross-border yuan settlement and clearing business with market share of more than 30%. The NIM recovery for BOCs foreign currency business will be a differentiator for BOC against its SOE peers and provide upsides for BOCs revenue growth. Compared with peers, BOC's noninterest income has a more balanced and diversified structure, with returns on debt investment, insurance business, leasing, and precious-metal trading services. ","BOC's net interest margin will face rising downward pressure along with the government's policy easing. We anticipate the bad-debt ratio to increase to 6.5% by the end of our forecast period. However, an economic hard landing and property price slump could trigger further deterioration in BOC's asset quality. BOC has the lowest provision level among the Big Four state-owned banks. Its deposit base also appears weaker than its peers.",02/05/2023,"Bank of China is the country's fourth-largest bank by assets. Its respected brands, solid expertise in China's cross-border banking services, and cost advantages position it to benefit in the long term from China's increasing integration with the global economy. BOC boasts extensive global reach among Chinese banks. Overseas business represents about one fourth of BOC's total assets and contributed about 26% of operating profits . BOC's key strategic focus includes serving the thriving financing needs in the ""Belt and Road"" region and meeting banking demands following CNY internationalization. BOC now covers 53 countries and regions, including over 20 countries along the ""Belt and Road"" region. The bank aims to provide comprehensive financing support to large Chinese firms' investment and M&A overseas, via its subsidiaries including BOCHK, fund, financial leasing and insurance firms. Leveraging its inherent advantage in cross-border banking, BOC benefits from CNY internationalization. It exclusively owns 11 of 23 CNY clearing banks globally, leading global peers in terms of cross-border CNY clearing and settlement. Despite its robust growth and status as an industry pioneer, BOC's internationalization remains in the early stages. Profitability for business in countries outside of the Greater China area is low, owing to a thin interest-rate spread and weak funding base in these markets. Average return on assets in overseas markets remains weaker than returns in mainland China.  We expect good potential for future growth in BOC's wealth management business, thanks to a huge, quality retail customer base, and strong growth in bank wealth management product scale in recent years. We believe BOCs average customer is wealthier than those of Big Four peers, as total assets managed by BOCs private bank accounted for 20% of the banks retail assets under management, or AUM. Such proportion was higher than that of close peers. By leveraging the synergies of the groups financial subsidiaries, BOC has established a reputed brand for wealth management.","We do not believe Bank of China possesses an economic moat, as it does not benefit from cost advantages. Banks normally earn competitive advantages mainly from low funding and operating costs relative to peers. Though BOC has low funding and operating costs, such advantages failed to translate to higher-than-peer net interest margin or profitability, in our view. BOCs return on average common equity was 11.3%, which has fallen below 12% since 2018 as result of falling interest rates and slowing fee income growth. As China's fourth-largest bank, BOC commands market share of about 7.8% of the country's deposit market and owns the extensive global branch network among Chinese banks.Despite the low deposit and funding costs, its past-three-year average net interest margin, or NIM was 1.81%, consistently lower than the 2.18% of big four peers. We believe this was attributable to the thin margins of its foreign currency business and overseas banking business, and relatively high deposit costs of its domestic RMB business compared with big four peers. BOCs past-three-year average deposit rate of its domestic RMB business was 1.89%, consistently higher than the 1.59% average for big four peers. Further, its deposits share was lower at 74% of total liabilities, versus the over 81% of other big four peers, implying slightly higher reliance on wholesale funding. Retail deposit, generally has lower deposit rates, and contributed only 43% of total deposits, lower than a range of 47% to 59% for other big four peers. We believe these ratios reflect BOCs relatively weaker retail customer base than peers.In addition, BOCs foreign-currency exposure resulted in a lower-than-peer asset yield. Past-three-year average loan rate and interest-earning asset rate were 4% and 3.4%, respectively, versus the 4.3% and 3.7% average for big four peers. As pressured by the falling rates of the foreign currency business especially after the COVID-19 outbreak, BOCs average loan rate reported a sharp contraction of 46 basis points from 2019s level, versus the average 23-basis-point decline for other big four peers during the same period. Despite a rebound in the USD loan rate in 2022 as benefited from Fed rate hikes, BOCs average loan rate remains lower than the average rate of big four peers.","We have assigned a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium to BOC, down from High, as we believe the bank now has low exposure to off-balance-sheet lending practices, a strong deposit base in underserved rural areas, and hefty provision coverage to buffer credit risks. Moreover, the Big Four banks enjoy strong capital positions. We believe state-owned enterprises have more defensive earning attributes, as these banks are responsible for channeling funds to infrastructure and strategic sectors, especially during times of economic downturn with anemic credit demands. The continuous net interest margin pressure and asset-quality risks are to critical risks to Chinese banks in our view.Credit quality was largely stable, with its bad-debt ratio dropping 13 basis points from 2020 to 1.33% in 2021 and bad-debt balance growing 0.7% to CNY 209 billion, mostly on worsening credit quality in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors. Its bad-debt formation ratio fell to 0.55% in 2021 due to strict risk management. Leading indicators for credit quality including special mention loans and overdue loans ratio saw a continuous improvement to 1.34% and 1.07%, respectively in 2021. BOC boasts a lower-than-peer bad-debt formation ratio, and credit costs have stayed below 1% over the past few years. There have been signs of increasing bad-debt formation, especially in the trade-related sector and we are concerned BOC's lower-than-peer provision coverage ratio will weigh on future earnings growth.We believe BOC's environmental social and governance risks are low and immaterial to the group. We see failure to meet regulatory requirements, laws, or mis-selling products, and weak internal control as the largest and potentially most material risks the bank must manage. We do not make any specific allowances for potential (unknown) penalties or customer remediation in our base case, given the amount is very small when compared with BOC?s business scale as evidenced by past cases.","The Capital Allocation Rating for BOC is Standard, in our view. The banks capital ratios stand comfortably above our projected minimal regulatory requirement. Its technology investment is at reasonable level, which enabled costs savings and improve operating efficiency over the past few years. However, its strategic focus in overseas and cross-border banking business has introduced higher-than-peer volatilities and margin pressure than peers. In 2021, the banks core Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, and capital adequacy ratios were 11.30%, 13.32%, and 16.53%, respectively. Current regulatory minimum ratios for Chinese banks are 7.5%, 8.5%, and 10.5% after considering a 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The guiding opinion on Chinas domestic systematically important banks, or D-SIBs, rules which were released in April 2021 require different additional capital buffers for banks in different buckets. These buffers are 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, respectively, for banks in five buckets based on different scores which was graded on business scale, interconnectedness with other financial institutions, substitutability, and complexity. For Chinese big four banks which are regarded as global systematically important Banks, or G-SIBs, they are also subject to 1% to 1.5% additional capital buffers. The guiding opinion requires no overlap and the additional capital buffer for big four banks will be whichever the higher of G-SIBs or D-SIBs. Targeted core Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio and capital adequacy ratio for big four banks such as BOC are expected to be 8.5%, 9.5%, and 11.5%. BOCs current core Tier 1 ratio stands about 280 basis points above the regulatory target. The banks return on equity was 11.28% in 2021. We estimate this will support an about 7.5% growth in assets over the next three years. Given the governments call to have banks support real economy through bank lending, there will be some pressure for capital raising over the next five years. Though shares are currently trading at a large discount to our fair value estimate, we believe the dilutive impact will be small in general. This is because the bank is backed by the central government. And the newly issued shares by SOEs are not allowed to be priced below 0.9 times of their book value, as required by the regulator. The bank maintains its dividend payout ratio at 30% over the past few years, we expect future dividend payout will remain at current level. Technology investment reached CNY 18.6 billion or 3.1% of total revenue for BOC in 2021. Key areas of technology investment include Big Data, cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence. The ongoing digitalization enabled the bank achieve cost savings, with cost to income ratio remained low at 28.17% as of in 2021. ","Bank of China was founded in 1912 with headquarter in Beijing. The bank has evolved as a central bank, international exchange bank, and state-owned bank specializing in foreign trade business. BOC was listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges in 2006. It provides a comprehensive range of financial services to customers across greater China and overseas. Central Huijin, a Chinese state-owned investment company and BOC's largest shareholder, controls 64%.","Bank of China has stable funding. The company's deposits, about 40% of which are kept as low-cost demand deposits, represent nearly 80% of total liabilities. Both ratios remained relatively steady over the past five years, thanks to the company's strategic focus on deposit growth. Bank of China improved its tangible common equity ratio to 8.3% from 5.7% in 2009, with tangible equity representing over 95% of total shareholders' equity. Along with other Big Four banks, BOC 's dividend payout ratio was 30%; we expect it will stay at current level during our forecast period. The firm's core Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, and total capital ratio stood at 11.30%, 13.32%, and 16.53%, respectively in 2021. The increase was attributable to BOC's strong organic growth and the issuance of other Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital bonds to boost its capital position.",601988.SS,Financial Services,1064105476096.0,SHH,118609900.0,CNY,3.9600000381469727,True,0,3.8376543315827156,4.196075991735443,1
24/11/2023,"MGM's Macao Demand Recovers, While Vegas Sales Remain at All-Time Highs",MGM Resorts International,MGM,4,,Dan Wasiolek,40.35,USD,23/11/2023,55.0,High,,Standard,C,,No Text Available,We expect MGM to be awarded the only urban Japanese gaming concession due to its strong experience operating leading resorts in Las Vegas and its successful record of working with partners. MGM is positioned to participate in Macao's long-term growth opportunity (22% of prepandemic 2019 EBITDAR) and has seen its room share expand (to 8% from 3%) with the opening of its Cotai casino in February 2018. MGM's U.S. properties are positioned to benefit from the expansion of the multibillion-dollar domestic sports and iGaming betting market.,"The majority of cash flow for MGM comes from the Las Vegas region, which has lower regulatory barriers, margins, and ROICs than Macao. The Macao government is transitioning the region's mix toward a nongaming full resort destination site, which could place outsize pressure on growth for MGM, given its relatively low nongaming mix. The Chinese government has full control over labor, table allocations, gaming licenses (which it could revoke), and travel visas. Also, it is increasing its supervision of VIP play, which can result in volatile periods of growth for the region.",15/11/2023,"No-moat MGM Resorts' Macao (22% of prepandemic 2019 EBITDAR) sales have rebounded sharply in 2023 (reaching back above 2019's level in the second quarter), after the Chinese government removed COVID-19 restrictions on Jan. 8, 2023. And although Macao faces elevated operational risk from government oversight, the company remains positioned for the attractive long-term growth opportunities in the region. Further, MGM's leading omnichannel presence in the U.S. should aid it in the sports betting and iGaming growth markets. Also, we expect the company to have a Japanese integrated resort in 2030, accounting for an estimated 5% of total EBITDAR that year.  We see solid Macao industry visitation over the next 10 years, as key infrastructure projects that alleviate Macao's congested traffic (Pac On terminal expansion and Hong Kong Bridge in 2018, light-rail transit at the end of 2019, and reclaimed land in 2020-25) come online, which will expand the region's constrained carrying capacity and add attractions, thereby driving higher visitation and spending levels. As MGM holds one of only six gaming licenses, it stands to benefit from this growth. Further, MGM Resorts has expanded its room share in Macao to 8% from 3% with its Cotai property, which opened in February 2018. That said, the Macao market is highly regulated, and as a result, the pace and timing of growth are at the discretion of the government. In the U.S. (78% of prepandemic 2019 EBITDA), MGMs casinos are positioned to benefit from a multibillion-dollar sports betting and iGaming markets, generating an estimated low-double-digit percentage of the company's 2027 sales (based on its 50% ownership of BetMGM). That said, the U.S. doesnt offer the long-term growth potential or regulatory barriers of Macao; thus, we do not believe the region contributes a moat to MGM. Still, there have been very minimal industry supply additions this decade, and this should support solid industry Strip occupancy, which stood at around 90% in prepandemic 2019. MGM was awarded an urban gaming license in Japan, with a resort opening in 2030, generating attractive returns on invested capital in the low teens.","Although we estimate MGM held an industry-leading 20% revenue share of the U.S. commercial gaming market in 2022, we see the company as having no moat due to its outsize exposure to Las Vegas (74% of 2022 EBITDAR) and U.S. regional markets (31%) (Macau had negative EBITDAR in 2022) where regulatory barriers are lower, leading to competitive markets that result in returns on invested capital below the companys weighted average cost of capital until 2031. That said, we believe MGM's execution and strong integrated resort experience in Las Vegas afforded it a gaming concession in Japan, a market we expect will generate economic profit worthy of a narrow moat. Also, we award the Macao gaming industry a narrow moat due to its high regulatory and land barriers, and MGM currently holds one of only six gaming licenses in the region. However, its exposure to Macao (22% of 2019 EBITDAR; we use 2019 as Chinas zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy materially impacted profitability in the Macao gaming industry during 2020-22) and Japan (5% of estimated EBITDAR in 2030, the year we model an MGM resort to open) is too low to warrant a narrow moat for the company in aggregate.Although we do not think the firm's Las Vegas and U.S. exposure benefits from a moat, it is encouraging that long-term supply and demand characteristics have improved from past decades. After 79% and 24% room supply growth in Las Vegas during the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, respectively, room supply did not increase through 2022, maintaining at around 150,000 rooms. That said, the Fountainebleau Resort and Casino will add around 4,000 rooms in late 2023. Still, we believe that demand will be able to match this supply addition, as historically room expansion and visitation in the region have been correlated, as travelers are enticed to see new attractions. Further, Vegas is now home to professional football, and mens and womens basketball teams, along with more marquee concerts, which we think will drive trips to the region. We are constructive on MGMs opportunity in the U.S. sports and iGaming industry, which totaled $7.5 billion and $5 billion, respectively, in sales in 2022, up from $430 million and $500 million in 2019. The ramp in sports and iGaming wagering has been driven by a Supreme Court ruling in 2019 that opened the activity to territories other than Las Vegas. In total, sports betting and iGaming amounted to two thirds of total U.S. gaming growth during 2019-22, highlighting the importance of this segment to industry operators. We expect the current 30-plus states and District of Columbia that have legalized betting to expand to around 40 states by 2025, helping drive further sales growth. We expect MGM to hold a leading sales share in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming markets, given its omnichannel presence. It is our stance that long-term winners in this segment will be those with a strong physical retail presence, which will leverage mobile and loyalty assets. In this vein, MGM has 29 retail casinos, with a dominate presence in the Las Vegas region. Further, the company has a leading loyalty membership of about 40 million, second only to Caesars 65 million. As a result, MGM can efficiently acquire, retain, and cross-sell customers across its physical and digital assets.Although we do not view MGM as having a moat, it is still encouraging that its solid execution of operating some of the worlds best-integrated resorts has assisted in its approvals for new casinos in Massachusetts (only one of three gaming licenses awarded), Macao expansion in Cotai, and a Japan facility opening in 2030. While we do not attach moats to U.S. casinos, we do believe the Japan and Macao gaming industries have moat qualities driven by a favorable demand and supply situation. In Japan, we estimate limited gaming supply, with the only urban resort license being awarded to MGM. We also foresee strong demand for gaming in Japan driven by the nation's high per capita income, density, and apparent propensity to gamble, exhibited by its existing $30 billion pachinko parlor industry. We think the attractive supply and demand dynamics in Japan will generate ROICs in the low teens, thereby supporting narrow-moat qualities.The Macao gaming industry also has an advantageous supply and demand setup. With regard to supply, there are only six gaming licenses in Macao, which were renewed at the end of 2022 for another 10 years. This was our expectation, given the meaningful capital MGM and its peers have deployed during the past 20 years (MGM has laid out $2.7 billion in Macao capital expenditures in 2016-22), which has positively developed the Macao economy (industry gaming represented the majority of the regions prepandemic GDP and 20% of total employment). Demand for Macao's gaming market is aided by China's growing middle-income class, as well as the region's improving infrastructure, which will enhance accessibility for visitors. As a result of this solid supply and demand relationship, we believe the Macao region holds a narrow moat. This view is despite Macao's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau's announcement in September 2021 of plans to increase direct supervision of casinos, which increases the long-term operational risk in the region.We see MGM maintaining its regulation intangible asset advantage in Macao. The MGM Macau is located on the Macao peninsula and not on the Cotai Strip, where the mix of traffic has migrated. However, MGM opened its Cotai property in February 2018, which increased its room share to 8% from 3% among the six concessionaires. MGMs room count may increase by another 700 rooms in Macao toward the end of this decade if phase two of MGM Cotai moves forward, which would bring the total room count to 2,800.In total, MGMs ROICs do not offer enough quantitative support for a narrow moat rating. We forecast ROICs including goodwill to average 8% over the next five years, near the companys 8% cost of capital.","Our Uncertainty Rating for MGM is High. In 2021, China's zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy kept Macao's industry gaming sales at just 30% of 2019's level, and in 2022 at only 14%.In 2009, U.S. gaming sales on the Vegas Strip declined 19%, and VIP rolling chip volume in Macao faced a double-digit decrease in the first half of 2009 amid the credit crisis and a steep decline in the Chinese stock market. Also, Macao showed weakness as a result of anticorruption activities in China during 2014-16, as well as renewed concerns about slowing economic growth and currency devaluation. More recently, industry VIP gaming revenue dropped a high-teens percentage in 2019 due to uncertainty from trade tariff discussions between the U.S. and China. Also, the government announced late 2021 that it would increase direct supervision of Macao casinos, which is likely to hinder VIP play.The central government controls the number of gaming tables, labor for development projects, and visas for Chinese visits to Macao, and in September 2021 it announced plans for heightened supervision of casinos.A delay or halt of legislation focused on bringing gaming resorts to Japan would affect our fair value estimate, which forecasts the company opening a facility in the country in 2030. Further, the framework of a license in Japan is still undetermined and could negatively affect the profitability and intrinsic value of the company.MGM faces environmental, social, and governance risks like gambling addiction, which could stoke government restrictions and affect demand. Also, its resorts operate at all hours and days of the year, using energy and supplies, which if not properly managed could cause some people to lose interest in visiting. Additionally, it has customer data, which it must be careful to protect, so as not to cause distrust.","We see MGMs balance sheet as improved, its investment strategy as fair, and shareholder distribution as appropriate, resulting in a Standard capital allocation rating.MGMs balance sheet risk has improved, with debt/EBITDA averaging 4.2 times during the prepandemic years of 2017-19 versus a 10.0 times average in 2014-16. MGM has worked debt levels lower in 2022, with its debt/EBITDA ending the year at 1.8 times. We see MGMs revenue cyclicality as medium and expect debt/EBITDA to average 3.0 times during 2023-27, as the company issues new credit in front of its Japanese development, which we expect to open in 2030. Around 70% of its debt is set to mature in the next three years (2024-27), and, overall, debt represents around 30% of the companys enterprise value at our existing fair value estimate.We hold a fair view of MGMs investment strategy. On one hand, we like the companys focus on gaining a gaming license in Japan, as we think the region offers an opportunity to generate economic profit, and we would welcome any investment to expand its Macao presence, although this would require approval from the government. Also, we view leaseback asset sales as favorable, since they generate cash that MGM can use to reinvest in growth areas like Japan. Further, MGM has developed a record of execution, as it removed meaningful costs out of its model. In the more competitive U.S. markets, MGM is making appropriate investment in the sports betting and iGaming markets, as well as ongoing investment to keep its physical assets relevant. We think such investments are needed to keep pace with peers and dont stand to generate economic profit.MGMs shareholder distribution is appropriate, as we see the companys focus prudently remaining on improving its balance sheet position and reinvesting in its business to remain competitive. Dividends have been put on hold, as capital allocation is focused on share repurchases and reinvesting into sports betting, iGaming, and the Japanese gaming market. We see these decisions as prudent.","MGM Resorts is the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip with 35,000 guest rooms and suites, representing about one fourth of all units in the market. The company's Vegas properties include MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, and Bellagio. The Strip contributed approximately 74% of total EBITDAR in 2022. MGM also owns U.S. regional assets, which represented 31% of 2022 EBITDAR (MGM's Macao EBITDAR was negative in 2022). MGM's U.S. sports and iGaming operations are currently a high-single-digit percentage of its total revenue. The company also operates the 56%-owned MGM China casinos with a new property that opened on the Cotai Strip in early 2018. Further, we estimate MGM will open a resort in Japan in 2030.","MGM entered 2020 in an improved financial position. This was illustrated by its 3.7 times debt/adjusted EBITDA in 2019 versus 13 times and 5.7 times in 2010 and 2015, respectively. It was also buoyed by MGM having recently exited an investment cycle, where the company spent $1.6 billion on average annually during 2015-19 to construct and renovate U.S. and Macao resorts versus the $271 million, $491 million, and $765 million it spent on capital expenditure in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. The recent sales of underlying casino assets (such as Bellagio in November 2019, Circus Circus in December 2019, MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay in February 2020, and the sale of Mirage in 2022) provided it with cash, helping it shore up its liquidity profile. Also, MGM received $4.4 billion in cash for its ownership in MGM Growth Properties, which was acquired by Vici in the first half of 2022. The firm has taken further action to lift its liquidity profile by reining in expenses, tapping its $1.5 billion credit facility (which has since been paid and reissued at $1.675 billion), and suspending dividends and repurchases, the latter of which have since been reinstated. The company paid just a $0.01 dividend in both 2021 and 2022. MGM has $750 million in debt maturing in 2024, followed by $1.9 billion in 2025, with an EBIT interest rate ratio of 2.8 times in both those years.",MGM,Consumer Cyclical,13950249984.0,NYQ,5285709.0,USD,40.34999847412109,True,1,40.51223548440118,43.164814843079014,1
25/11/2023,Autoliv to Capitalize on Backlog in Passive Safety Technology,Autoliv Inc,ALV,3,22/10/2023,Richard Hilgert,102.47,USD,24/11/2023,101.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,22/10/2023,"Narrow-moat Autoliv reported third-quarter earnings per share before special items of $1.66, missing the $1.79 FactSet consensus EPS by $0.13, but it is $0.43 ahead of the $1.23 reported last year. We believe the shortfall was due to a slight increase in customer output disruption sequentially from the second quarter and inflationary cost pressures. Revenue increased 13% to $2.6 billion as volume, customer recoveries, and the chip shortage all improved compared with a year ago. Excluding favorable currency, organic revenue increased 11%, outperforming a 4% increase in global light-vehicle production by 7 percentage points due to launched new business and customer recoveries. Adjusted operating income jumped 41% to $243 million from $173 million last year. Margin expanded 190 basis points to 9.4% from 7.5% last year on higher volume and cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by slightly worse customer call-offs compared with the second quarter. Despite the UAW strike at Autolivs Detroit 3 customers, management tweaked 2023 guidance higher with organic revenue growth of 17%, up from 15%, and reduced tax rate to 20% from 32% due to reorganization on cost-cutting efforts. Adjusted operating margin guidance was unchanged at 8.5%-9.0%. The UAW strike had minimal impact on the third quarter, but the firm said it expects $6 million in revenue per week strike impact and assumes the labor shutdown lasts until the end of November in its guidance. We model revenue slightly below managements guidance, with organic revenue growth of 15%. Due to high uncertainty remaining from the UAW strike, output disruption (chips, logistics), inflation, war in Ukraine and Israel, and weakening global auto market economies, we assume an 8.5% 2023 adjusted operating margin at the low end of guidance. The time value of money added $2 to our fair value estimate, lifting our fair value estimate to $101 from $99. The 3-star-rated Autoliv shares trade at a 4% discount to our new fair value.","Autoliv possesses a culture that enables regular and consistent innovation, commercializing technology that generates solid margins and returns on invested capital. Increasing safety content per vehicle across global markets is a growth opportunity for which Autoliv is well positioned. Rising U.S. and European NCAP safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use advanced safety technologies to achieve a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety systems interact with active safety.","The auto-parts supply industry is highly competitive and customers expect annual, contractual price reductions. The cyclical, capital-intensive nature of the industry means that a modest volume decline could translate into a significant drop in profitability. Raw material costs are volatile, adding a degree of uncertainty to margins.",22/10/2023,"Autoliv is the global market leader (43% share in 2022) and is well positioned for growth in vehicular passive safety content. An ability to innovate and then commercialize technology has helped support profitability and returns. Rising New Car Assessment Program safety standards will require auto manufacturers to use active safety features to even be considered for a 5-star crash test rating. Autoliv's passive safety products interact with active safety systems in occupant collision protection. As consumers in emerging markets become wealthier, demand for safety content should increase. In addition, as roads become more crowded and traffic fatalities increase, developing countries may require safety legislation similar to that required in Europe and the United States. Autoliv has demonstrated technological leadership. The company and its predecessors introduced two-point seat belts, the retractable seat belt, seat belt pretensioners, side-impact air bags, and various pedestrian collision safety technologies. It annually spends about 5% of sales on research and development and holds more than 6,600 patents, mainly in air bags and seat belts. Additionally, Autoliv has produced an average of 4.4 percentage points of returns in excess of its cost of capital since 2002. More than 70% of Autoliv's workforce is located in low-cost countries, compared with about 30% at the end of 2002. We view this as a strategic positive as Autoliv pursues business in developing markets, leading to a leaner cost structure and enabling the firm to spend larger amounts on research and development without compromising margins. It also positions the company to take advantage of its customers' objective to use more global, common vehicle architectures.","The sources of Autoliv's narrow economic moat rating include its intangible assets, high customer switching costs, and to a much lesser degree, its cost advantage. Some safety product areas are also oligopolistic, resulting in a slight efficient scale moat source benefit. The company's moat also benefits from a substantial global manufacturing presence, highly integrated and long-term customer ties that result in sticky market shares, and moderately improved pricing power from a well-diversified customer base. Since 2002, Autoliv's return on invested capital has exceeded its weighted average aftertax cost of capital for an average of 4.4 percentage points in economic profit. Autoliv's consistent technology innovation enables favorable pricing relative to many automotive industry suppliers, increasing the company's dollar content per vehicle. New innovations typically debut on European and North American luxury vehicles, where average safety content is around $400 per vehicle. In general, automakers are willing to pay for components and systems that provide substantial product differentiation, weight reduction, enhanced safety, or reduced cost, as is the case with Autoliv. Having a diversified global customer base provides Autoliv the opportunity to maximize pricing of its innovative product technologies by selling to a broader group of clients. Autoliv's customers would incur prohibitively high switching costs should they decide to withdraw business in the middle of a vehicle program, especially when Autoliv has a supply agreement for a complete set of passive safety systems. Costs for switching to another supplier would include the substantial lead time and investment to develop and validate new components, the potential for production disruptions, and the cost of moving equipment and tooling. The whole process of changing a critical supplier like Autoliv might cost an original equipment manufacturer as little as a few million dollars to as much as several hundred million dollars, depending on the size and scope of the components or systems being replaced.Automotive OEMs prefer vendors like Autoliv that can supply components and systems on a global basis. To reduce costs, some of the underlying safety components of a particular vehicle sold in the U.S. may be the same as another vehicle that might be sold in Europe, South America, or Asia. As emerging-market countries develop, a greater number of these safety components may become common to more than one region. Also, some countries have local content laws that require a certain percentage of components to be sourced from within that country. Winning a contract to supply a major component or system for a global vehicle program requires a supplier with a substantial global manufacturing presence.With more than 70% of Autoliv's global workforce now located in low-cost countries, the company has a lower fixed-cost base than other automotive suppliers without a moat. Developing a global footprint like Autoliv'swith 62 production facilities in 27 countrieswould require a huge capital investment, a substantial barrier to entry for potential competitors, particularly given the challenges for auto suppliers to consistently turn an economic profit. Close ties with OEM customers are integral to success in the automotive industry supply base and create another significant barrier to entry. New-vehicle lead times can run as long as 36 months. Autoliv's engineers participate very early in the development process, especially when an all-new vehicle platform is being developed, because safety is not only important to consumers but also mandated by governments. Once launched, most vehicle programs have a 5- to 10-year lifecycle, assuring Autoliv long-term contractual streams of revenue, albeit subject to volume changes dependent on consumer demand for specific models and overall economic conditions. When a vehicle nameplate has a complete redesign, including active and passive safety systems, and Autoliv is the supplier for the predecessor program, the company typically becomes the incumbent supplier for the redesigned successor vehicle program. In total, Autoliv potentially has a 6- to 13-year tie-up (development and production) with each customer's vehicle program. We view Autoliv's diverse, well-established, long-term, highly integrated customer relations, supplying hundreds of vehicle programs, as an invaluable barrier to entry.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Autoliv is High. Commodity costs and declines in global vehicle production present the biggest risk to Autoliv. Commodity exposure to volatile oil, steel, and copper prices adds risk to margins during periods of high inflation. Annual contractual price reductions for OEM customers are an auto industry norm, so Autoliv has to aggressively employ kaizen, kanban, and Six Sigma Lean manufacturing programs to advance cost savings. To maintain pricing and margin, Autoliv also requires continual investment in innovation. A loss of focus in cost reduction or technological development could result in an erosion of profitability and return on invested capital.Additionally, the company operates in a capital-intensive industry subject to cyclical demand. As a result, Autoliv has a high degree of operating leverage, so sudden declines in volume can have a meaningful impact on profit. Conversely, any increase in sales following large cost-cutting measures significantly raises profits. The potential changes to profitability brought on by the firm's operating leverage and cyclical demand results in our High Uncertainty Rating.We think Autoliv has some environmental, social, and governance risk exposure, which we include in our uncertainty rating. The firm supplies the global automotive industry, which is transitioning to zero-emission electric powertrains from emission-producing internal combustion engines. Autoliv provides passive safety products for electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. The firm also has product governance risk exposure from potential vehicle safety recalls, which have increased compliance scrutiny from various governments' safety regulations. Autoliv's products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain highly skilled human capital with expertise in various engineering disciplines.","We assign Autoliv a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized maintainable midcycle, we estimate Autoliv's return on invested capital exceeds its weighted average cost of capital by roughly 10 percentage points.The balance sheet is sound, with 1.1 times net debt/EBITDA and a net debt/total capital ratio of 14% at the end of December 2022. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound. Management states that it targets net debt/EBITDA of 0.5-1.5 times and a strong investment-grade credit rating. Since 2012, the company has returned roughly $3.2 billion to investors, averaging about $300 million per year, in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. During the past 15 years, Autoliv's median dividend payout ratio is approximately 35%. However, cash-conservation measures deployed because of COVID-19 included the suspension of the dividend and share repurchases after the first quarter of 2020. Autoliv reinstated its quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2021.Upon the spinoff of Veoneer in July 2018, Mikael Bratt became the president and CEO of Autoliv, replacing Jan Carlson, who had held the position since 2007 and who became president and CEO of Veoneer. Before assuming his current position, Bratt had been president of Autoliv's passive safety group since May 2016. Before joining Autoliv, Bratt was with Volvo Group for 30 years, most recently serving as the executive vice president in charge of group truck operations and previously as Volvo Group CFO. We expect Bratt to continue Autoliv's record of creating shareholder value.We like that management creates shareholder value by returning profits to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After the 2009 Great Recession, the company resumed its dividend effective for the third quarter of 2010 and increased it 17% for the fourth quarter of that year. In 2020, the company terminated quarterly dividends after paying $0.62 per share in the first quarter. The dividend was reinstated in the second quarter of 2021 at $0.62 per share but raised to $0.64 in the fourth quarter and then to $0.66 late in 2022. During the 15-year period from 2007 to 2022, dividends per share grew at a 4% average annual rate. A share-repurchase program is still in effect. The company reactivated a share-repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2013. Since then, Autoliv has repurchased over $1.1 billion worth of its stock. In November 2021, the board authorized a new share-repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion or 17 million shares, whichever comes first, from January 2022 to the end of 2024. Autoliv also deserves credit for its financial transparency. The company provides more detailed information than many of the parts companies we cover.","Autoliv is the global leader in passive safety components and systems for the auto industry. Products include seat belts, frontal air bags, side-impact air bags, air bag inflators, and steering wheels. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is the company's largest customer at 11% of 2022 revenue, with Stellantis accounting for 11% and Volkswagen 10%. At 34% of 2022 revenue, the Americas was Autoliv's largest geographic region, followed by Europe at 27%, China at 21%, and Japan at 8%.","We view Autoliv's financial health as relatively strong for an auto-parts supplier. Excluding commercial paper and overdraft facilities, the company has excellent liquidity of $1.7 billion, with approximately $0.6 billion in cash and an undrawn $1.1 billion revolving credit line at the end of December 2022. Since 2012, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR has averaged an investment-grade credit level of 1.9 times. While credit facilities are unsecured and there are no financial covenants on the firm's debt, management seeks to maintain a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.5-1.5 times and was at 1.1 times at the end of 2022. Overall, Autoliv's financial health and free cash flow generation are much better than many in its peer group. We view the company as being well positioned to withstand a challenging decline in global new-vehicle demand, which was demonstrated during COVID-19-induced industrywide factory closures in 2020.Autoliv has generally maintained a conservatively financed balance sheet. Capital requirements have been met with funding from operating cash flow and the company's unsecured revolving line of credit. Since 2012, total debt/total capital has averaged 16.1%, while net debt/total capital, which takes into consideration the company's cash position, has averaged 6.3%. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, a leverage metric that takes into consideration a company's use of operating leases, has averaged 1.9 times but has exceeded the average every year since 2018 at or above 2.2 times after taking on debt in conjunction with the Veoneer spinoff. Veoneer received a $970 million cash infusion from Autoliv to fund heavy R&D spending.",ALV,Consumer Cyclical,8838937600.0,NYQ,586767.0,USD,102.47000122070312,True,0,95.18363207648939,108.69143620932681,1
24/11/2023,NIB Holdings' Earnings Outlook Is Positive Even if Private Health Margins Fall,NIB Holdings Ltd,NHF,3,15/11/2023,Nathan Zaia,7.58,AUD,24/11/2023,7.5,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,15/11/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimate on narrow-moat NIB Holdings at AUD 7.50 per share, with a somewhat mixed trading update immaterial to our medium-term forecasts. NIB reported a 1.3% increase in Australian resident policyholders since June 30, on track to meet our 3% growth estimate for fiscal 2024. Making up around 75% of profit, it remains the key driver of the group. Premiums are tracking a little higher than we forecast across all the private health offerings, Australian residents, international students and workers, and New Zealand, so we lift our premium forecast around 3.5% in fiscal 2024. Cost of living pressures have not resulted in policy downgrading and even policy cancelations yet, and while it remains a risk, we expect will be relatively modest given pressures on the public health system and tax incentives continue to encourage participation. We continue to expect the lower-than-expected claims catch up post-COVID-19, which has been aiding earnings, will become less of a tailwind in the future. The Australian health insurance division's 8.9% net margin in fiscal 2023 remains well above the 6%-7% range we see as maintainable. The NIB travel business, which has been benefiting from a rebound in travel activity, was weaker than expected following the end of a white-label agreement with Qantas. The travel insurance businesses made an AUD 14 million profit in fiscal 2023 from a AUD 7 million loss in fiscal 2022, which we now estimate halves in fiscal 2024. A new white-label partnership with Woolworths Group, expected to launch in November, will provide solid growth in fiscal 2025, but travel insurance earnings are expected to remain a small contributor to group earnings.","Industry growth is tied to a steadily increasing population, ageing demographics and a rise in healthcare spending. The symbiotic relationship of private hospital operators, and buyer power over general practitioners, is a key strength of NIB's business model. NIB is a large insurer of international visitors, and Australia could become even more popular if labor shortages remain.","There is increasing risk of the regulator refusing to fully pass through higher claims costs if participation continues to fall, which would be detrimental to margins. NIBs strategy to diversify outside private health could be value-destructive. Tough economic conditions, increasing premium costs and increasing awareness of comparison websites contribute to higher lapse rates, policy downgrading and participation rates falling.",15/11/2023,"NIB Holdings is Australias fourth-largest provider of private health insurance. In addition to private health insurance for Australian and New Zealand residents, the firm also provides health insurance for overseas students and temporary overseas workers in Australia, and distributes travel insurance internationally.  NIB has consistently grown its share of the market over the last five years. The insurer is expected to continue spending a larger share of expenses on marketing than peers, which lifts profit and adds scale. This further strengthens the group's future prospects and competitive position. Smaller players with lower margins do not have the financial headroom to engage in marketing (advertising, commissions to brokers, bonus offers) at the same level as NIB, nor can they support white-label offerings. NIB offers white label solutions for Suncorp Group and Qantas. As one of the larger players, NIB is also motivated to help bring down industry claims to improve affordability and support participation rates. While we have not factored in any material benefit in earnings, we like that NIB seeks to use membership data and industry expertise to prevent illness and personalize treatment.  Despite larger players generating respectable returns on equity on mid-single-digit profit margins, smaller providers have less capacity to absorb the expected claims inflation. This could eventually lead to industry consolidation or at least a pullback in marketing expenses and policyholder acquisition costs. In this scenario, NIB could acquire smaller, less-profitable insurers to grow share, lower costs, and strengthen the competitive position relative to suppliers, or simply retain share while pulling back expenses. NIB made two acquisitions to grow its travel insurance offering, with the rationale to diversify revenue outside of private health insurance, add exposure and scale in an industry expected to experience long-term growth, and leverage its claims management capability and existing distribution channels. NIB more recently acquired businesses that offer services to participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. ","Australian private health insurers operate in a heavily regulated industry where premium increases must be approved by the government, hospital claim expenses are partially pooled, and capital requirements are set by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The size of annual premium rate increases is typically to cover the prior years claims inflation. The risk equalization scheme ensures claims of more costly policyholder groups are shared across the industry and prevents insurers from discriminating based on health, gender, and age. Ultimately younger and healthier members help subsidize the cost of healthcare for older age groups. While these two factors cap NIBs ability to expand margins and returns, government policy settings are in place to promote the take up and retention of private health insurance products. With private hospitals easing the burden on the public system, we do not expect this to change, allowing NIB to deliver consistent underwriting profits and returns on equity. NIBs combined operating ratio, which compares claim costs and other expenses to premiums, has averaged 93% over the past 10 years and at no stage has the COR exceeded 100%, with return on equity averaging 23% over that period. This stable and solid performance supports our view that NIB has maintainable competitive advantages, warranting a narrow economic moat rating. Risk equalization aims to average out the claims paid per policy holder across health insurers. However, not all claims paid by the industry are pooled, with tiered percentage of claims by age group added into the pool. Given NIB has just under 10% share of all private insurance policyholders, we believe its scale provides moderate pricing power over healthcare providers, albeit an inferior position to larger players such as Medibank and Bupa. We believe this negotiating power is evident in NIBs gross margin across hospital and extras (premiums less claims) being well above the industry averages. The Australia private hospital sector is consolidated, with Ramsay Health Care, Healthscope 15%, and not-for-profits St Vincents Health and St John having dominant positions. Attracting new members for NIB would be challenging without an agreement with these large hospital providers. However, there are mitigating factors that we think make the relationship symbiotic for both parties. For instance, the potential loss of policyholders may be lessened by the urgency of some required procedures; as an example, the maximum waiting period for pre-existing conditions and obstetrics is 12 months. Most specialists also operate out of more than one hospital, and can dictate where the patient should go for treatment. Furthermore, the hospitals ability to exert pricing power over health insurers is tempered by the fact that outsize price increases would lead to fewer people with insurance and fewer procedures in private hospitals. Ultimately both parties need each other. We believe NIB is in a stronger position when negotiating with more fragmented dental, optical, and physio operators. In addition to preferred providers where NIB members receive additional discounts, NIB has established its own branded dental and eye-care centers. We believe these centers help NIB maintain some control over fees, support the brand, and offer members no-gap services, increasing perceived customer value. NIBs management expense ratio is typically higher than the industry average. We still believe the scale benefits of spreading marketing dollars over a large customer base holds true, with the weaker expense ratio reflecting NIBs current focus on growth. White label offerings for Qantas and Suncorp, where NIB pays a commission of premiums, and sales via retail brokers, both are likely much more costly than direct to consumer sales. This strategy has resulted in NIB growing its market share over the last five-years while most of the other top-five have lost share. Growing the number of policyholders adds to cost advantages. NIBs higher lapse rate in comparison to Medibank also adds to the need to spend more on client acquisitions to maintain growth. We believe NIBs focus on younger, more price sensitive customers via online comparison websites and white-label partners contribute to the higher lapse rates. The use of gift cards to entice new members also has a higher probability of attracting individuals open to shopping around each year for the best deal. Despite policyholders being armed with improved access to information online, a large number of policyholders still take a ""set and forget"" approach though. Product complexity dampens the consumers capacity to compare and change products despite the introduction of a tier rating structure in April 2019: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Basic. The tiers mandate minimum service coverage, but there are still many variants across the industry with inclusions above the minimum requirements. The comparisons with general extras are even more complicated, with different options around maximum amounts which can be claimed back on each event. The wide range of choices in the market discourages consumers from switching due to the time required to compare the different products and waiting periods of up 12 months which must be served out before being able to claim for some services.Despite competing with not-for-profits some of which have no restrictions on members being part of a certain industry (for example, teachers, nurses, police)NIBs cost advantage with the support of switching costs has made it difficult for smaller players to take meaningful share. Most smaller funds are already part of The Australian Health Service Alliance which represents many private health insurers in Australia. Combining the market share of all these funds aims to negotiate satisfactory terms with hospital and health care providers. This alliance has been in existence since the early 1990s, with restricted funds such as Defence Health and Teachers Federation Health the main members which have been able to take share. We believe it is more likely these funds have been more successful in converting employees within the industry to switch or join rather than the alliance underpinning a competitive advantage. We do not believe NIBs travel insurance business benefits from maintainable competitive advantages. With policies needed to be constantly replaced and a reliance on referral partners for distribution, NIB is reliant on third-parties such as airlines, travel businesses, general insurers, and other retail businesses to attract customers. Both customer switching costs and agent switching costs (to another insurer) are low. NIBs travel insurance is underwritten by a subsidiary of AXA with the business model reliant on reinsurers to take the claims risk.","NIBs annual earnings are exposed to the number of events or claims, and the cost of each claim, potentially exceeding estimates used when premium rates are set. The very short time frame for settling claims does reduce the period an insurer is exposed to outstanding claims risk. The risk equalization pool also redistributes insurance risk across the industry, and while this reduces the threat to profitability by being overrepresented in older demographics, it can have a negative impact on profits if the rest of the industry experiences higher claims than NIB. The private health insurance industry is heavily subsidized by government rebates and levies on individuals which encourage the take up of private health insurance, bringing political and regulatory risks. Under the current regime, premium increases are subject to approval from the federal health minister. The process leaves the health insurance industry exposed to unfavorable political agendas or decisions. Private health insurers making attractive returns could result in a period of price increases being below growth in average claims. We see claims inflation as a structural issue affecting affordability. With the rising cost of drugs and medical personnel, equipment and infrastructure, and an ageing population, there is a risk that at some point not enough young members remain insured to subsidize rising claims in older age groups. NIB's environmental, social, and governance risks primarily relate to data privacy and irresponsible underwriting practices, but we consider this risk to be very low. We, therefore, don't incorporate ESG risks into our base case. We believe taking all these factors into consideration makes a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium most appropriate.","We assign NIB a Standard capital allocation rating.We expect NIB to retain a healthy balance sheet which provides headroom to withstand a higher-than-expected rise in claims or fall in investment income. Given claims volatility in health insurance is much lower than in other general insurance lines, we view current level of debt as manageable.NIB has generally used debt and excess capital to balance the capital needs of the business, shareholder returns, and make acquisitions across private health and travel insurance. We believe the current dividend payout ratio target of 60% to 70% of NPAT is reasonable but could be increased if no M&A opportunities arise. Being much smaller than Medibank and Bupa, we believe NIB is more likely to be involved in industry consolidation if smaller funds face financial difficulty. At the right price these acquisitions would add to the group's competitive advantages.We believe most of NIB's acquisitions have helped improve the firm's cost advantages and competitive standing, with travel insurance the exception. In September 2017, NIB acquired corporate private health insurer, GU Health, for AUD 155.5 million. GU health had 34,000 policyholders across more than 260 corporate clients and augmented NIB's presence in the corporate group market. Prior acquisitions similarly added to NIB's Australian and International health insurance businesses, such as IOOF Health Services, OnePath Life, and Tower Medical Insurance.While management could not have foreseen the COVID-19 pandemic and impact on revenue, the entrance into travel insurance in our view has seen revenue diversify into a sector where NIB lacks a maintainable competitive advantage and cyclicality is much higher. NIB acquired World Nomads Group to begin its own travel insurance business and diversify away from the highly regulated health insurance industry. NIB subsequently acquired QBE Travel. While scale is important to build cost advantages via distribution and underwriting arrangements, we'd prefer investment be made into the core private health insurance business. ","NIB Holdings is Australia's fourth-largest health fund. It is a national provider of private health insurance, life insurance, travel insurance, and related healthcare services, with a growing presence in New Zealand. Approximately 55% of the population is covered by private health insurance because of taxation benefits, shorter wait times, a choice of doctor and hospital, and cover of ancillary health services. ","NIB Holdings is in sound financial health. Cash flow generation from operations is typically strong, and we forecast the firm to pay dividends within its current 60% to 70% target dividend payout range.As of June 30, 2023, NIB had AUD 246 million in debt and a gearing ratio of 20% (debt/capital), within its long-term target gearing ratio of 30%. This is expected to rise as capital is deployed for acquisitions in plan management for participants of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Given lower claims volatility in health insurance than other insurance lines, we view this level of debt as manageable and forecast gearing to remain steady at current levels.Investment assets of AUD 1.3 billion were allocated 49% cash, 36% to fixed income, 11% to equities, and 4% to property and other assets as of June 30, 2023.

24/11/2023,Sherwin-Williams Benefits From Resilient Residential Repaint Market but Near-Term Headwinds Persist,Sherwin-Williams Co,SHW,2,24/10/2023,Spencer Liberman,274.65,USD,23/11/2023,214.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,24/10/2023,"Wide-moat-rated Sherwin-Williams reported strong third-quarter results as a decline in new residential construction was more than offset by gains across Sherwins portfolio. Sherwins pricing power has been on full display recently as the company continues to realize previous pricing actions while also benefiting from moderating raw material costs. Despite a slowdown in existing home sales and housing starts, Sherwin is still experiencing growth in residential repaint, and we expect this trend to continue through the end of the year. We've increased our fair value estimate to $214 from $211 per share due to time value of money. The paint stores group continued to perform well as strength in residential repaint, property maintenance, and commercial offset a pullback in new residential construction. Net sales increased 3.5% year over year while the segments operating margin expanded over 400 basis points to an impressive 26%. The paint stores group benefited from higher selling prices and lower raw material costs in the quarter but faces pressure from new residential, which we expect will remain a pain point into next year. The performance coatings group posted solid results in the quarter, with net sales falling 1% but operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 16.2%. Strength in auto refinish and industrial wood offset much of the decline seen in packaging during the quarter. We expect packaging to rebound next year as inventory destocking trends moderate, but tepid global industrial production could weigh on the segment. Management raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, now expecting adjusted EPS of $10.20 (midpoint) from $9.50 previously. This raise comes as little surprise to us given the strength in most of Sherwins end markets this year. When also considering moderating raw materials costs and robust selling prices, we think this new guidance is attainable and expect the company to exit the year with strong momentum.","Professional painters have favored Sherwin products for decades, leading to strong brand loyalty and pricing power. New residential construction and increased rental properties should provide strong tailwinds for residential coatings growth. The exclusive partnership with Lowes creates an additional avenue for Sherwin to sell its products to new customers without meaningful cannibalization risk.","Residential repainting surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in a near-term glut. The company's margins are sensitive to raw material prices. Higher titanium dioxide or petrochemical prices could lead to margin contraction if Sherwin is not able to pass along those costs to customers. Sherwin has continued to open roughly 100 company-owned stores per year, but saturation could become a concern. If fewer stores are opened, overall growth could slow.",24/10/2023,"Sherwin-Williams is the largest provider of architectural paint in the United States. The firm has over 4,900 stores and sells premium paint at higher price points than most competitors. Sherwin-Williams also sells its products in big-box stores and provides coatings for original equipment manufacturers. More than three fourths of Sherwin's business occurs in North America, with much of its international exposure acquired during the 2016 purchase of Valspar. The acquisition of Valspar has bolstered its previously modest retail presence, as Valspars long-standing relationship with Lowes led to an exclusive partnership for Sherwin in 2018. Sherwin also obtained Valspars industrial business, expanding its performance coatings segment.  In Sherwin's largest segment, the paint stores group, it has maintained strong growth, even in developed markets, as it rolls out nearly 100 new stores every year throughout the Americas. Its strategic focus on building this segment has created a strong value proposition for contractors. Job site delivery, in-app ordering, and a capacity for high-volume orders save time for customers and allows for premium product pricing. Roughly 90% of sales in the paint stores group are to professional painters with the remaining 10% to do-it-yourself consumers.  The consumer brands segment markets Sherwin's paint brands through retail channels, such as Menards, and is the exclusive provider of coating products to Lowe's. It owns a variety of widely known brands such as Valspar, Purdy, Minwax, Krylon, Thompson's WaterSeal, and Dutch Boy. The performance coatings business produces a diverse product mix and accounts for much of the company's global exposure. The segment sells everything from marine paints to airplane and fire-resistant coatings, many of which are custom-formulated to suit client needs.","We think Sherwin-Williams benefits from durable competitive advantages that should support economic profits for at least the next 20 years. We assign Sherwin a wide moat rating based on its intangible assets. The paint stores group and consumer brands segments (accounting for more than 75% of segment EBIT) enjoy strong brand equity, which has supported durable pricing power. While the performance coatings segment benefits from switching costs, we give it a narrow moat as we do not think its pricing power is as durable as the company's other segments. The segment does not represent a large enough percentage of the consolidated portfolio to warrant extending the switching cost moat source to the firm. That said, Sherwin's wide-moat segments (the paint stores group and consumers brands business) account for most of the firm's profits, leading to our wide-moat rating for Sherwin-Williams. Sherwin-Williams is one of the most trusted brands in the residential paint industry, producing high quality products sold at premium prices. Following its 2016 acquisition of Valspar, Sherwin became the worlds largest paint and coatings producer. Of the four largest paint companies, Sherwin has a dominant position in the North American professional paint market and solid DIY exposure. In the U.S architectural paint market, professional paint makes up roughly 60% of sales while DIY accounts for about 40%. Sherwin reaches the professional market through its vast network of retail stores, and the firm leverages its Lowe's partnership to reach DIY painters that prefer the big box format. Professional painters have strong preferences based on quality, ease of use, and availability. Additionally, professional painters are much less price sensitive as 80%-90% of their costs are labor while only 10%-20% are for materials. Many trust the quality of the Sherwin brand and are willing to pay more for its products. Sherwin-Williams paint is well known in the industry for having desirable characteristics, including coverage (fewer coats needed), durability (lasts longer), cure time (less waiting time), and ease of application. For interior paints, Sherwins quality typically ranks similarly to two of its largest competitors (Behr and Benjamin Moore). When looking at exterior paints and stains, Sherwin ranks substantially higher than most competitors. Exterior paint jobs are usually done by professionals due to the size of the job and need for specialized equipment. These professional painters are willing to pay more for quality paints that make their jobs easier. This dynamic provides strong pricing power for Sherwin in the professional space. While there are competitors that produce quality paints at similar or lower prices, Sherwin can leverage its trusted brand and convenient retail network to retain and add professional painters to its network.The paint stores group operates over 4,900 specialty paint stores in North and South America. The consumer brands group supplies Sherwins retail stores and other retailers and distributors with a broad portfolio of products. The retail stores are a key part of Sherwins operating model as they make purchasing supplies for professional painters convenient and consistent. The firm's vast retail footprint means that professional painters are never far from a store where they can purchase the same Sherwin products they have relied on for years. Professional painters prefer suppliers that allow them to be as efficient as possible with their time. Sherwin's management training system and concentrated focus on customer service has created a portfolio of pro-painter benefits that have long been unmatched. Mobile and web ordering platforms, a volume rewards program, extremely high-quality products, and optional job-site product delivery are designed to make contractors dependent on Sherwin-Williams. Sherwins retail store footprint supports the firms strong brand as it makes the procurement and purchasing of paint convenient for professional and amateur painters. Sherwin has strong relationships in the paint and coatings industry, including an exclusive partnership with Lowes to sell its paints and coatings. This partnership provides Sherwin with an additional avenue to sell its products to customers who prefer to shop in big-box retailers. While there is concern the Lowes partnership could cannibalize sales from Sherwins company owned stores, the products sold through Lowes target DIY customers rather than the professional painters who purchase from Sherwins retail stores. Additionally, 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and 17 of the top 20 property management companies partner exclusively with Sherwin Williams for coating supplies. While new residential construction is only a part of Sherwins business, its a testament to the companys deep ties in the professional paint market. Sherwins performance coatings segment (approximately 30% of revenue) sells everything from marine paints to airplane and fire-resistant coatings. Sherwin materially increased its industrial exposure with its 2016 acquisition of Valspar. The acquisition also increased Sherwins exposure to EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region. In our view, the Sherwin brand has less pricing power in the industrial space than the architectural market. There is much more competition in the global industrial coatings market compared with North American architectural. That said, some industrial coatings and coatings applications are developed specially to meet clients' product needs. Given that coating is generally embedded as a step within the broader production process, factors like dry time, cure time, and abrasion resistance can affect the pace or process throughout the remainder of assembly. In some cases, specialized equipment and processes are required to apply the coating. Because of this, a coating switch has costly implications for only marginal savings per unit. This dynamic causes a stickiness in the industrial business that is not enjoyed in the architectural market.","We assign Sherwin-Williams a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. The most substantial risk we see is a prolonged downturn in residential and commercial construction and residential repaint. While construction is more cyclical than repaint, both would be affected during a downturn and weaken the companys overall financial performance. Still, we think Sherwin has a durable business model and should be able to generate returns above its cost of capital, even in a downturn. Sherwin owns its retail stores, controlling all aspects of pricing and distribution. That said, high operating costs associated with this ownership model expose the company to risk. If sales were to decline, Sherwin would still have to pay the operating costs of its vast retail footprint, which would weigh on returns on invested capital. Sherwins acquisition of Valspar in 2016 for roughly $9 billion was its most significant acquisition. While it increased the company's exposure to the less-moaty industrial coatings business, the acquisition increased Sherwins architectural market share and led to its exclusive partnership with Lowes. After the company faced antitrust scrutiny for its acquisition of Valspar, we expect any future deals will be modest. Sherwin-Williams is exposed to some environmental, social, and governance risks, including environmental and social impact of its products and services and carbon emissions from its operations. However, we don't believe these risks could result in material value destruction. Regulations around chemicals have increased in recent years, but Sherwin has a long history of developing innovative products that reduce its overall environmental impact. Over 30% of the firms products are considered environmentally advantaged, and it has reduced its carbon emissions nearly 17% since 2017. We expect the firm's product leadership and its commitment to environmentally friendly products and lower carbon emissions to continue.","We assign Sherwin-Williams an Exemplary capital allocation rating. This reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (both organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Exemplary rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and mixed shareholder distribution ratings.Sherwins balance sheet is sound, in our view. We believe the company's leverage is reasonable considering its stable profitability and solid free cash flow generation. Management has made positive strides in reducing its leverage following its acquisition of Valspar and we expect this trend will continue. We view Sherwin-Williams' investment strategy as exceptional. As the largest player in the North American paint market, the company continues to successfully expand its store footprint and has gained market share both organically and inorganically. In our view, Sherwin-Williams has executed well on improving its value proposition to the pro painter customer base that relies on its North American store network. Perhaps partially attributable to luck, management's focus on U.S. architectural paints has also played into a few key trends. More households renting and an increasing preference to hire painters has supported volume, in contrast to less compelling volume growth for industrial coatings in North America. We expect management will continue to capitalize on attractive reinvestment opportunities through store expansion and bolt-on acquisitions. We also see appropriate reinvestment in product innovation, marketing, and distribution that will support the firms ability to maintain its significant market share in North America. We see Sherwins shareholder distributions as mixed. Management is committed to returning cash to shareholders, which is done through both dividends and share repurchases. While the company is considered a dividend aristocrat with over two decades of dividend growth, we see its share buybacks as somewhat dilutive, as the firm has routinely purchased stock at prices above our fair value estimate. We expect sizable shareholder distributions going forward as Sherwin continues to generate solid free cash flow.Sherwin-Williams announced that Heidi Petz will assume the role of CEO on Jan. 1, 2024, and current CEO John Morikis will serve as executive chairman of the company. Petz currently serves as the companys president and chief operating officer, a role Petz has held for the past two years. Petz joined Sherwin-Williams in 2017 through the Valspar acquisition and has served as the president of the consumer brands group at Sherwin and president of the Americas group prior to becoming COO in March 2022. This announcement is not surprising given Sherwins history of succession planning, and we do not expect material change in the companys strategy, considering Petz most recently served as the companys COO. Sherwin has executed its strategy well for years as it positioned its stores across the U.S to serve professional painters who are willing to pay more for high-quality paint that was readily available. Petz oversaw this operation when she was president of the Americas group, and we expect a continued focus on the North American professional paint market and strategic store expansion.","Sherwin-Williams is the largest provider of architectural paint in the United States. The company has over 4,900 stores and sells premium paint at higher price points than most competitors. Sherwin-Williams also sells paint-related products in big-box stores and provides coatings for original equipment manufacturers.","We think Sherwin-Williams has a sound capital structure, and its consistent free cash flow generation should easily support its debt service requirements and future capital allocation decisions. Leverage increased following the 2016 acquisition of Valspar. Management has made progress in reducing debt, with net debt/adjusted EBITDA coming down to below 3.0 from 4.5 in 2017. Following Sherwins acquisition of Valspar and PPGs 2018 acquisition of Comex, there are few North American paint companies that could be potential acquisition targets for Sherwin. We dont anticipate Sherwin will make any sizable acquisitions in the near future as the company focuses on its retail stores and Lowes partnership. Sherwin leverages its commercial paper program and credit facilities to fund a portion of its working capital and expenses. Because of this, the firm usually has less than $250 million of cash on hand. The firm has roughly $9 billion in outstanding debt with staggered maturities through 2052, but its next maturity isnt until 2024 when roughly $1 billion is due. Sherwin-Williams has a history of strong free cash flow generation, even in a downturn, which demonstrates the durability of its business model.",SHW,Basic Materials,72266874880.0,NYQ,1358911.0,USD,274.6499938964844,True,0,259.75908400591413,309.3754408094642,1
24/11/2023,Etsy Should Emerge Stronger as Cyclical Pressures Abate; Wide Moat Continues to Look Intact,Etsy Inc,ETSY,5,,Sean Dunlop,71.48,USD,23/11/2023,145.0,Very High,Wide,Standard,C,,No Text Available,"Etsy's investments in its star seller program, purchase protection, and shipping time estimates should help improve platform trust and may allow the firm to move upmarket toward inventory with higher average prices. After more than doubling its 2019 buyer base, Etsy has likely reached a demand tipping point, with high teens active buyer penetration across its core six markets heightening barriers to success for new entrants. The firm's increased reach in international markets and among customers who identify as men should add a long-term leg to its active user growth journey.","Without many high frequency items on its marketplace, Etsy lacks the natural traffic draw that larger e-commerce peers like Amazon command and is commensurately more sensitive to cyclical factors. Local players may have an advantage in international markets, given their nuanced understanding of those cultures and regulation that often favors homegrown companies. Ety's superdiscretionary product suite and the proliferation of drop-shipped, relatively commoditized goods could see the marketplace operator struggle to increase the critical average platform spending per user metric.",06/11/2023,"Etsy has carved out an interesting competitive niche, jockeying for e-commerce wallet share across a variety of heterogeneous verticals in the long tail of unbranded products. The firms marketplace propertiesEtsy, Reverb, and Depopall target non-commoditized inventories (artisanal crafts, used musical instruments, and vintage clothing resale), generate commissions on third-party, peer to peer sales, and strive to create a treasure hunt experience around a unique, customizable, and consequently less price elastic product suite. The firm's core ""Etsy"" marketplace accounts for roughly 90% of consolidated gross merchandise volume, or GMV.  We view Etsys competitive strategy as sound, with the quickly growing firm capitalizing on a surge of COVID-19-induced demand, providing one of only a handful of outlets through which customers could purchase face masks during the nadir of the pandemic. Though mask sales have dwindled, the platform has remained sticky, with Etsy seeing its consolidated active buyer base swell to 95 million at the end of 2022, roughly level with 2021 figures and more than double the firm's prepandemic figure. As the marketplace leans into brand marketing to increase its unprompted awareness, invests in platform search functionality and filtering, and reduces purchase friction with its buyer protection program and better platform policing, we see a viable route to mid-single-digit growth in average annual per buyer spend over the decade to come. In the future, we expect Etsy to onboard unique inventory, to expand its burgeoning international operations (45%-50% of GMV), and to expand its suite of seller tools and advertising options, while periodically targeting competitively advantaged tuck-in acquisitions that offer exposure to similarly differentiated end markets. Particularly important will be efforts to increase repeat purchase behavior, with the long-term driver of GMV growth likely to be increased average revenue per user in lieu of buyer acquisition after the firm achieves saturation in its six key marketsgetting buyers to go to Etsy not just for the cushions, but for the couch.","The e-commerce industry is extremely competitive, featuring almost perfect price transparency, fostering little customer loyalty, and engendering relentless competition to shave a few basis points from costs, or to improve fulfillment speed by a couple of minutes on the margin. Attributable to a surfeit of investor interest in the space, and minimal barriers to entry, the channel has seen everything from the conception of myriad niche marketplaces (with five to 10 dedicated to some form of clothing resale) to spinoffs of traditional retail companies e-commerce apparatuses, laying the groundwork for what appears to be an inevitable consolidation of digital shelf space over time. Operators positioned to emerge from the maelstrom, in our view, are those that dig moats around enduring competitive advantages: durable marketplace network effects, access to unique customer data or inventory, or scale-driven cost advantages. In our view, Etsy is one of the few companies poised to emerge as one of e-commerces long-term winners, eschewing competition in commoditized categories like fast-moving consumer goods as the firm has recognized its inability to effectively compete for sales that are driven principally by price and fulfillment speed considerations. Instead, the firm has built a competitively advantaged marketplace around a catalog of non-traditional, unique, customizable, and artisanal inventory, deriving a competitive edge from a network that grows more valuable as additional buyers and sellers join the platform. Further, Etsy benefits from access to an almost entirely non-standardized suite of more than 100 million products, with those items mapping to neither stock-keeping units nor universal product codes, allowing the firm to develop search algorithms that would effectively be impossible for peers to emulate. While Etsys narrow purview naturally limits its long-term total addressable market, it has allowed the firm to mobilize a network of some 7-8 million largely untapped sellers (disproportionately from craft fairs and live selling events) and more than 95 million active buyers at year-end 2022, en route to a commanding share of a fragmented craft market. Our wide moat rating suggests a horizon for excess returns upwards of 20 years; a view embodied by our forecast for 48% average annual adjusted ROICs (including goodwill, capitalized development, marketing, and general and administrative costs) through 2032, healthily exceeding our 8.7% weighted average cost of capital estimate.We believe that a complete discussion of Etsys competitive advantages demands consideration of the nature of the firms network effect moat source and its quantitative underpinnings, the importance of search engine optimization in the category, and a brief consideration of available alternatives.Accordingly, considering the firms network effect, we view a marketplace platform that grows increasingly valuable as buyers and sellers are onboarded as one of the most powerful and rarest moat sources in our coverage. While buyers are widely viewed as the economic engine of a marketplace, the buyer experience is beholden in some capacity to the quality and depth of the seller pool. Access to a platform with more and better sellers improves the buyer experience, reduces search costs, and improves product discovery, all of which continue to improve as more sellers are onboarded. On the seller side, access to a larger pool of buyers, particularly buyers with purchase intent and interest in their category, often results in better sale prices, quickened inventory turnover, and reduced illiquidity-induced discounts to product fair value. Thus, the seller experience improves as new buyers join the platform, incentivizing further growth on both sidesa demand flywheel that is difficult to stop beyond key tipping points, which we've estimated as 10% of the internet-using population in a geography in past research. Ultimately, growth does not constitute an enduring competitive advantage. Rather, the hallmark of an enduring network effect, and a direct reflection of the value added by a marketplace operatorin the form of demand aggregation, enhanced trust, payment facilitation, dispute arbitration, and business development toolsis the firms ability to effectively monetize its platform without driving participants to the exit.In our view, Etsy scores well on all these counts, connecting 95 million active buyers and 7-8 million active sellers across six key geographies (the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Canada, and Australia) on a marketplace that accounted for more than $13 billion in gross merchandise volume, or GMV, in 2022. The firms position looks durable, in our view, with World Bank data and our calculations suggesting that Etsys active buyer count is good for 15%-20% penetration across the aggregate internet-using population in those six geographies. Perhaps more poignantly, the firm has been able to effectively monetize that cohort, with our estimates suggesting a consolidated take rate (Etsys take of $1 of platform sales) of 19.3% in 2022, driven by listing fees, final value fees (6.5% on the core marketplace), payment processing, offsite advertisements, shipping labels, and seller services. The firms growth has lifted results for both Etsy and its platform sellers, with a 33% GMV compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last five years outstripping the 24% annual growth in broader U.S. e-commerce, despite Etsys take rate increasing by 580 basis points during that period. While a high-teens take rate falls well shy of wide-moat Amazons high-20% figure, it stacks up nicely against more relevant competitors like narrow-moat eBay (14%) and niche marketplaces like recently acquired Depop (10%), with the lack of a proprietary fulfillment arm at Etsy accounting for the lion share of divergence with the e-commerce behemoth.Further, the firm provides a suite of valuable services for its buyers and sellers in support of its marketplace. Buyers receive access to a truly unique product suite, catering to an audience that values self-expression, unique decor, and supporting local artisans and entrepreneurs. The platform reduces uncertainty, easing fears of fraudulent transactions and intermediates post-purchase conflicts, while adding a uniquely human twist to notoriously depersonalized online shopping through a messaging platform. On the seller side, Etsy amalgamates demand in an extremely fragmented end market, offering access to a buyer base of more than 95 million potential customers, with language processing services allowing sellers to tap into a global audience that otherwise would be inaccessible. Further, Etsy offers a clean, easy to use user interface (UI) for smaller sellers, featuring a seller handbook and attractive advertising rates that are likely much cheaper than rates to go it alone. For example, Etsys offsite advertising commissions are currently 12%-15% of sales prices and only charged for sales which convert (a cost-per-action model, the most favorable for sellers). For sellers who choose to go it alone, utilizing white-label solutions like narrow-moat Shopify, wed expect much higher advertising outlays--particularly considering the advertising spend among the largest direct-to-consumer brands on public markets, which range from the midteens to the low-30s, by our estimates. Finally, and not inconsequentially, we surmise the firms search engine optimization efforts--underpinning our data-driven intangible asset moat source--lead to better conversion and demand aggregation than would likely be available on competitors sites. Innovation continues to be seller-friendly, adding video and augmented reality to make listings pop, investing heavily in platform development, and working relentlessly to translate search terms to search intent.The firms competitive position largely insulates it from competing on the basis of price and fulfillment speed, with an emphasis on non-commoditized productsoften crafted, handmade, and customizeddisincentivizing multihoming and (generally) exempted from 24-hour delivery expectations. In fact, internal surveys provide us with two important data points: first, that 87% of sellers agree that Etsy has items on its site that you cant find anywhere else, and second, that only 56% of Etsy sellers are multichannel sellers (implying that 44% derive all of their sales through Etsy). Critically, Etsy is the primary sales channel for the vast majority of its sellers, with the second most prevalent being craft shows and live selling events--dispelling the popular misconception that Amazon Handmade or eBay compete heavily for category share. The firms top categories: home furnishing, jewelry and personal accessories, craft supplies, apparel, paper and party supplies, and beauty and personal care, reflect its strategic emphasis, but naturally limit the viable total addressable market. To this point, our analysis of e-commerce volumes in the U.S. and the firms consolidated 2022 average revenue per user figure ($132 on the core marketplace) suggest that Etsy customers only deploy about 4% of their e-commerce dollars on Etsy, a figure that offers plenty of white space but will likely never approach the figures of larger marketplaces with a larger mix of business-to-consumer, or B2C, sales like eBay ($500s) and Amazon (estimates range from $600 for nonprime members to nearly $2,000 for prime customers). Nonetheless, were encouraged by positive cohort spending trends over time, with the firms habitual buyers (7%-8% of active buyers) now accounting for 40% of marketplace GMV, raising the glass ceiling for GMV growth over time, since the biggest growth lever in the long term will likely shift toward user monetization in lieu of user acquisition. In effect, we believe that Etsy is competitively advantaged and can continue to grow its share of consumer wallets, but its unlikely that well see the degree of monetization we do from marketplaces that sell conventional B2C productsand thats OK.Briefly considering the firms subsidiary marketplaces (Reverb, Depop), which we havent figured into our moat calculus yet (representing 10%-15% of consolidated GMV), we take a positive view of the firms efforts to poach potential winners in advance of category consolidation. Time will tell whether the market demands specialists in every category--apparel, handmade goods, musical instrument resale, sneaker resale, home goods, and so onbut it certainly strikes us as unnecessary to have myriad specialists within those categories, likely catalyzing near- to medium-term consolidation now that access to capital has tightened up. Reverb, for example, competes for share with Sweetwater and a handful of smaller marketplaces for musical instrument resale spending, while Depop operates in an uber-fragmented clothing resale market that has seen micro-niches run the gamut from luxury resale to subscription services to social selling. Take rates upon acquisition reflect lower platform value exchange, generally clocking in around 10%, but back-office rationalization, marketing best practice sharing, and modest cross selling could help accentuate the more attractive features of those marketplaces, particularly if investor interest wanes and competitors are forced to get fit quickly, as we've seen in 2022 and 2023. The option to process payments through the Depop marketplace offers one vehicle for monetization, while advertising products are gradually being introduced across the firm's smaller marketplace properties. Given that the apparel resale marketplace has only recently worked toward integrating search customization (different results based on user search history), we surmise that there are plenty of benefits ""within the family"" to sharing best practices for marketing, search, and back-office functions.Considering the firms intangible assets, we view a proprietary product database of more than 100 million listings and aspects for unique goods--without a stock-keeping unit or unique product code identifier--as a meaningful edge over peers who attempt to compete in the space. Given a seller base that skews toward individual proprietors and micro-businesses, Etsys algorithm is forced to translate search intent--""mens cocktail apparel should yield navy blazers, ties, or other items that share no key words with the query--into meaningful results, without the benefit of typical merchandising experience among sellers. Recognizing that a dress is approximately equivalent to a gown, or that a search for a blue desk shouldnt uncover blue desk lamps requires constant tinkering and deep learning algorithms (with natural language processing continuing to represent one of the most complex applications of artificial intelligence) but offers a meaningful edge over peers with fewer items for sale or more homogenous products. In our view, the firms algorithm is likely to get better as it gets bigger, perpetuating the demand flywheel by increasing conversion, optimizing the treasure hunt search experience, increasing the value of incremental impressions, allowing the firm to spend deeper into its marketing curve, and closing the loop by further improving the algorithm. Recent efforts like Xwalk,"" which collect 11 times the amount of data per search query, should continue to drive improvements in search, with Etsy now privy to newer data like dwell time, which has proven important. Look no further than GMV growth per dollar of product development--averaging nearly $30 over the next five years, by our estimates--to evaluate the efficacy of those efforts.Ultimately, we view a wide-moat rating as appropriate for Etsy, with our research suggesting that the firms network has reached critical mass in its key six markets, presenting a nearly insurmountable barrier to success for new, like-minded entrants. While Etsy will continue to compete for sellers with local consignment stores, niche marketplaces, social commerce, and white label (DIY) offerings, we view the firms easy-to-use seller services (catering to the firms smaller clientele), self-reinforcing marketplace network, and the continuously improving underlying value position as sufficient to defray competitive pressure. We view Etsy as one of the likely winners in a quickly evolving space, with access to a unique, differentiated product suite, strategic investments in the platform experience, and a strengthening marketplace network auguring well for economic value creation through the 20-year period implied by our wide-moat rating.","The e-commerce industry is intensely competitive, marked by constant innovation, increasingly rapid paths to scale, and low barriers to entry (despite relatively high barriers to success). Players are forced to vie for developer talent, customer wallet share, and for sellers (on marketplace platforms), with operators seeking to differentiate along the lines of product breadth and uniqueness, price, user experience, and access to an attractive pool of active buyers. While Etsys product suite is competitively differentiated, in our view, the firm's difficult to parse addressable market, position in a quickly evolving e-commerce channel, and nascent younger marketplaces render appropriate a Very High Uncertainty rating.In our view, international exposure and recent merger and acquisition activity represent substantial idiosyncratic risks. With 45%-50% of GMV tied to international markets, Etsy remains sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, while forced to navigate sometimes discordant tax policies and tariffs across geographies. Moreover, though the acquisition of Depop offers exposure to attractive end markets, they add a degree of integration risk, which could result in restructuring costs or fragmented management attention.While the firm is well positioned with respect to environmental, social, and governance risks, in our view, we flag two areas of concern: the ability to attract developer talent sufficient to support the robust growth the platform has recently, and potential data security concerns, with the firm responsible for any personally identifiable information of its customers, with recent regulations (the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, and California Consumer Privacy Act) getting increasingly punitive.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating for Etsy, reflecting the interplay among a fortress balance sheet, our neutral assessment of value creation from investing activities, and a mixed policy for shareholder returns.With our forecast for just 1.3 times average net leverage over the next five years (net debt/adjusted EBITDA), a paucity of near-term debt maturities, and a highly cash generative model--we forecast free cash flow to the firm averaging 17% of sales between 2023-27--balance sheet risk appears minimal for the marketplace operator. We believe that Etsy should encounter no difficulties in funding its investments in headcount and platform development with internally generated funds, while retaining substantial flexibility to invest in brand marketing and strategic acquisitions. With no principal maturities until 2026, we view Etsy's balance sheet health as strong, despite the firm carrying $2.3 billion in gross debt as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.Pivoting to investments, we believe that the firms forward prospects (and recent acquisition track record) merit a fair rating. Internal spending on product development continues to generate attractive returns--with our forecast suggesting that each dollar of product development cost yields (on average) just shy of a $30 bump to GMV over the next five years--and the firms search engine optimization initiatives should continue to bear fruit (and uphold the firms intangible asset moat) over time. Past investments, including the platforms migration to Google Cloud have clearly proven moat-accretive, while upper-funnel marketing spend in international markets have seen the firm expand its addressable market and diversify its revenue stream, deriving 45%-50% of GMV from non-U.S. markets.On the other side of the coin, Etsy's recent acquisition record looks spotty at best, with the firms largest (and most recent) acquisition, Depop, looking quite expensive relative to its competitive set, even after factoring in a hefty premium for better positioning or a more attractive (disproportionately Gen Z) customer base. The sticker price, $1.625 billion, suggested a more than a 23 times price/sales multiple at deal closure, and the firm took a $1.045 billion impairment charge on the subsidiary during the third quarter of 2022. An impairment charge on the firm's Elo7 (""the Etsy of Brazil"") acquisition in the second quarter of 2023 also warrants scrutiny, with those deals both executed at the top of the market. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and we appreciate the strategic rationale for Etsys acquisition of its house of brands marketplaces, with Reverb (musical instrument resale) and Depop (vintage clothing resale) featuring unique inventories, operating peer to peer (P2P) platforms, commanding broad buyer and seller bases, and potentially standing to benefit from best practice sharing and consolidated general and administrative expenditures. Similar to a venture model, if a minority of the firm's investments were to work (but those that did, to work brilliantly), then the firm would find itself in an excellent competitive position, and we agree with the premise that the online commerce industry is poised for consolidation over time. Particularly in an environment like today where peers like no-moat The RealReal and smaller, privately held companies are forced to hold back on capital investment and marketing, we identify substantial advantages to the incubation of smaller marketplaces under the aegis of a scaled operator like Etsy, leading us to posit that the firm's strategy is sound, even if its execution has been recently uninspiring (underpinning our ""standard"" assessment). Finally, we view managements capital returns philosophy as sound. The amount of shareholder distributions looks appropriate, and we appreciate managements investment waterfallinternal investments, strategic acquisitions (when fairly priced), then share buybacks. Longer term, absent further acquisitive activity, we'd anticipate pressure building for a cash dividend but would expect that to come only after growth and investment opportunities slow meaningfully, perhaps toward the end of our 10-year explicit forecast (2028). We anticipate 3%-4% average annual share buybacks between 2023-32, which we view as an appopriate use of capital only to the extent that shares trade below our assessment of intrinsic value. ","Etsy operates a top-10 e-commerce marketplace operator in the U.S. and the U.K., with sizable operations in Germany, France, Australia, and Canada. The firm dominates an interesting niche, connecting buyers and sellers through its online market to exchange vintage and craft goods. With $13.3 billion in 2022 consolidated gross merchandise volume, the firm has cemented itself as one of the largest players in a quickly growing space, generating revenue from listing fees, commissions on sold items, advertising services, payment processing, and shipping labels. As of the end of 2022, the firm connected more than 95 million buyers and 7.5 million sellers on its marketplace properties: Etsy, Reverb (musical equipment), and Depop (clothing resale).","We view Etsys financial position as sound. While the firm maintained $2.3 billion in debt on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2023, we forecast a manageable 1.3 turns average net leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) through 2027. Strong free cash flow to the firm generation--comprising 17% of sales annually over that period--serves to alleviate any lingering concerns regarding the firm's financial health. Etsy's operating model requires minimal maintenance capital expenditure, and the company maintains a reasonably sizable backstop with access to a $200 million credit facility. The marketplace operator leans heavily on a convertible debt financing structure that is common among high-growth technology firms. We identify a few key benefits to the approach; fewer restrictions, choice of cash or share settlement, cheap capital, and the ability to raise straight debt through subsequent issuance, which strikes us as reasonable (and aligns with practices at technology peers). Etsy limits potential dilution with a capped call derivative strategy, with subsequent series that have been utilized to prepay outstanding balances. While the principal value of these notes is accounted for in long-term debt, the equity portion (option value) is accounted for as additional paid-in-capital, with premiums amortized as noncash interest expense over the options life.Finally, we expect Etsy to maintain substantial financial flexibility to meet its allocation priorities--investments in the business, strategic acquisitions, and share repurchases. Consistent with management commentary, we dont anticipate any near-term cash dividend, with management preferring the flexibility associated with buybacks, though we'd expect pressure to pay a dividend to build in the longer term, particularly as the firm's cadence of international investment begins to slow.",ETSY,Consumer Cyclical,9823962112.0,NMS,5830222.0,USD,71.4800033569336,True,1,70.44311747831765,74.96308625774074,1
24/11/2023,Genting Singapore's Strong Recovery Is Over Prepandemic Level,Genting Singapore Ltd,G13,3,13/11/2023,Jennifer Song,0.92,SGD,24/11/2023,0.98,Medium,Narrow,Poor,,13/11/2023,"We've raised our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Genting Singapore to SGD 0.98 per share from SGD 0.96 following strong third-quarter results that included revenue and adjusted EBITDA well above 2019 levels. The pace of recovery is ahead of our expectations. We think that, given Genting Singapores higher reliance on VIP and premium demand versus peer Marina Bay Sands, rising flight capacity from key premium client markets helped to boost traffic to Genting. In particular, scheduled seat capacity between mainland China and Singapore reached 77% of 2019's level in the third quarter from about 50% in the prior quarter. We expect improving flight capacity to drive further upside, and we've raised our forecasts for 2023-25 revenue by 3%-9% and adjusted EBITDA by 12%-13% to reflect a stronger-than-expected growth outlook. We think the shares are currently undervalued. Third-quarter revenue rose 16% from a quarter ago to SGD 690 million, representing 116% of 2019's level, up from 94% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved 33% sequentially to SGD 346 million, hitting 125% of 2019's level. The results were boosted by the rebound in nongaming business and regional gaming demand after COVID-19-related travel restrictions eased. The results were largely in line with those of Marina Bay Sands, which reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA at 128% and 115% of 2019's levels, respectively. Management said it plans to invest a total of SGD 6.8 billion to upgrade and expand its integrated resort, Resorts World Sentosa; the plan, known as RWS 2.0, is expected to be completed by 2031. In addition, its new Waterfront project has received approval from the government, with development set to commence in 2024; it will comprise approximately 700 hotel rooms and lifestyle content. We think all this will strengthen the companys competitiveness in regional markets, buttressing its intangible asset advantages.","The Singapore government is unlikely to issue a new casino license, given concerns and political sensitivity over gambling-related social ills. Competition in the region may not be as intense as the market expects based on past experience. Singapore was one of the earliest countries to have reopened to international visitors. All restrictions are now eased, which should continue to restore the Singapore gaming sectors profitability.","A rise in COVID-19 case counts in Singapore and the ASEAN region could lead to volatility of tourism demand and delays in the gaming sector's recovery.  The Singapore government may tighten regulations to discourage local residents from gambling, limiting growth in the mass gaming market. The lack of junket presence in Singapore means Genting Singapore has to provide credit to high rollers, leading to higher receivable impairment risk.",13/11/2023,"Genting Singapore operates one of only two casinos in Singapore, with about 40% market share. The casino is part of Genting Singapores Resorts World Sentosa, a world-class integrated resort with a theme park, hotels, restaurants, and other nongaming facilities. RWS provides substantial nongaming revenue (around 25%-30% of total revenue) to Genting Singapore, having attracted more than 20 million visitors since opening in 2010. We believe RWS will continue to cement its position as a desirable destination for tourists and gamblers in Singapore, and this should ensure stable earnings growth for the firm. Singapore is Asia's second-largest gaming market and the worlds third-largest. Genting Singapore's 30-year casino license, granted by the Singaporean government, will expire in 2036. In 2019, the exclusivity provision was extended to 2030, removing concerns about the government issuing an additional casino license in Singapore in the near to medium term. Although casinos enjoy strong cash flows, integrated resorts are also capital-intensive businesses, as maintaining their appeal requires significant and regular reinvestment. The firm announced a SGD 4.5 billion expansion plan for RWS in 2019. Genting Singapore plans to invest SGD 400 million to upgrade some of its attractions and refurbish three existing hotels through 2023, to focus on combining business and leisure offerings to attract more premium customers. We think the diversified offerings from the RWS 2.0 project should help attract traffic and fend off regional competition, which will maintain healthy long-term growth.  The COVID-19 pandemic damped Singapore's gaming sector's performance, but with the government's decision to reopen the economy and resume travel in April 2022, we think the increased travel with ASEAN partners should provide improved visitors to the casinos, which underpins the upside for Singapore's gaming revenue, as international tourists made up two thirds of patrons at Singapore's casino before the pandemic.","We believe Genting Singapore has a narrow economic moat based on intangible assets, primarily in the form of a government license to operate a casino, which creates a high regulatory barrier to entry.The firm essentially operates in a domestically regulated duopoly market. In 2006, the Singapore government legalized gaming and subsequently issued two casino licenses: one to Las Vegas Sands and the other to Genting Singapore. The casino licenses were granted for a 30-year period with an exclusivity period expiring in 2030.Despite regional competition, Resorts World Sentosa, located in the highly desirable tourist destination of Singapore, attracts large volumes of VIP and mass gamblers from Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Approximately 75%-80% of Gentings mass-market customers come from outside Singapore, and 80%-90% VIP room gamblers are from Malaysia and China. RWS has several Michelin-starred dining establishments and has been honored with numerous local and international awards, including Best Integrated Resort for eight consecutive years at the Travel Trade Gazette Travel Awards. We are confident that RWS will remain a highly desirable regional destination for foreign gamblers. We think the firms SGD 4.5 billion expansion plan for RWS announced in 2019 is timely to maintain RWS long-term growth and fend off regional competition.Although Genting Singapores return on invested capital were below its weighted average cost of capital in 2020-22 due to the global travel headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the firms ROIC will exceed its WACC once visits resume, supporting our narrow economic moat rating.","We assign Genting Singapore a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium, down from High, as we believe there is now better visibility for the recovery of Singapore tourism traffic and casino volume with the worst of the coronavirus pandemic closures behind us. However, the risk remains that leisure and gambling demand could be dampened by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that leads to added travel restrictions and/or a global recession. At this current juncture with vaccines rolling out, we think this risk is relatively unlikely or will at least be manageable.Regulation remains a big risk factor for casino operators. The Singapore government is highly mindful of the social ills associated with gambling. Local citizens are charged an entry fee of SGD 150 upon entering the casinos in Singapore, and family members of gamblers can apply to the casinos to restrict their entry. We believe further regulatory tightening represents a potential risk for Genting Singapore if there are signs of increasing gambling problems.The dearth of junkets in Singapore means Genting Singapore has to provide credit to VIP high rollers, resulting in additional working capital compared with international peers. If the regional economy slows, we believe increasing impairment to trade receivables is inevitable. In addition, Genting Singapore's VIP business is heavily relying on Chinese gamblers, which exposes the company to policy risks such as the antigraft campaign in China, which deters Chinese VIPs from gambling in Singapore. Our Uncertainty Rating also factors in potential environmental, social, and corporate governance risks. Genting derived the bulk of its revenue from gaming operations, exposing it to risks inherent to casino operations such as money laundering and other illegal financial activities, as well as the negative social impact associated with gambling. However, we consider Singapore casino operators' overall exposure to ESG risks is manageable with stricter regulatory controls.","We assign Genting Singapore a Poor Capital Allocation Rating.During 2013-14, the management team aggressively pursued the VIP gaming market by offering more credit to high rollers. However, the firms excessive lending and unsuccessful debt collection subsequently led to heavy impairments and lower margins. Although Genting Singapore turned more cautious regarding the VIP segment in the first half of 2016, and impairment provisions have stabilized since the fourth quarter of 2016, we think management should have been more prudent in granting credit.In 2012, Genting Singapore issued SGD 2.3 billion of perpetual subordinated capital securities priced at 5.125%, with management commenting that the proceeds would go toward bidding for a casino resort project in Japan. However, the Japanese parliament did not pass a bill legalizing casino operations in Japan until December 2016. Meanwhile, Genting Singapore decided to fully redeem the perpetual securities in 2017 using internal cash flows. In our view, this reflected poor financial management, as the firm proceeded with the debt-raising before any confirmed project, leading to unnecessary interest expense.We would also like to see improved transparency from management. The group registered a fair value loss on derivative financial instruments of SGD 95 million in the second quarter of 2015 and SGD 61 million in the third quarter of 2015. However, management did not disclose full details regarding the instruments, commenting only that they were equity-like investments related to publicly listed gaming and hospitality entities, and the fair value loss was due to reduced market value in these investments. We think the insufficient disclosure regarding the instruments was one of the reasons for the selloff in the stock after second-quarter 2015 results. These marked-to-market losses and lack of disclosure reflect poorly on managements corporate governance.Genting Singapores annual dividend per share has increased from SGD 0.01 in 2011 to SGD 0.04 in 2019, which is very encouraging. However, with the firm's commitment of SGD 4.5 billion in RWS 2.0 projects and its ongoing interest in integrated resorts in Japan, we expect Genting Singapore to stay conservative in dividend payouts in the next few years.","Genting Singapore is engaged in the development and operation of integrated resort destinations, including gaming, hospitality, meetings, and leisure and entertainment facilities. It owns Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore, one of the leading integrated resort destinations in Asia, which offers a casino, Adventure Cove Waterpark, S.E.A. Aquarium, Universal Studios Singapore theme park, facilities for meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions, hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants, and specialty retail outlets.","Genting Singapore is in good financial health, with net cash of about SGD 3.5 billion, debt/adjusted EBITDA of 0.5 times, and adjusted EBITDA interest coverage of 98 times as of year-end 2022. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Genting Singapore's strong cash flow from its casino business indicates low default risk. Its net cash position ensures the company has sufficient resources to operate until a full sector recovery and fulfill its commitment of the SGD 4.5 billion RWS 2.0 project. As the company has dropped its efforts in an integrated resort in Yokohama, Japan, after the metropolis decided it would not pursue the casino initiative, we expect the company to continue to grow its dividend payouts over the next 10 years to reward shareholders.",G13.SI,Consumer Cyclical,11106239488.0,SES,15042200.0,SGD,0.925000011920929,True,1,0.8794330521678572,0.9642771073216869,1
24/11/2023,NetEases R&D Strengths Are Key to Developing Next-Generation Blockbuster Games,NetEase Inc,09999,4,17/11/2023,Ivan Su,175.2,HKD,24/11/2023,232.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,17/11/2023,"We're increasing our fair value estimate for narrow-moat NetEase to $150 from $146 after incorporating our assumption of a re-engagement with Activision Blizzard starting in 2024. The companys third-quarter earnings exceeded our and Refinitiv consensus expectations as of Nov. 16, thanks to impressive margins. ADRs went down 2% during U.S. trading on the news of the CFO's resignation for personal reasons. While we were surprised by the move, we do not expect Charles Yangs departure to have a negative impact on NetEases business. We continue to view NetEases current stock price as attractive, with the shares trading at 17 times 2024 P/E. In the third quarter of 2023, total revenue grew 12% year over year, with game revenue growing 18%. The strong game revenue performance was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from newly launched games, such as Justice Mobile, Racing Master, and Eggy Party. Profitability was another highlight for the quarter, with an operating profit margin of 27.7%, representing a more than 800-basis-point expansion from the same period last year. The improvement in profitability was mainly due to favorable revenue and channel mix shift, as well as better sales leverage. The company boasts an exciting pipeline as we head into 2024. Among the highly anticipated releases are potential blockbuster games like Where Winds Meet and Shediao, which have generated significant buzz within the gaming community. Additionally, the lineup includes other high-quality titles such as Mission Zero and Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile, further enhancing the company's game portfolio. With these forthcoming releases, we forecast a 13% growth in game revenue in 2024.","NetEases expertise in asymmetric multiplayer (Identity V and Dead by Daylight) would allow it to capitalize on future opportunities in this genre. The firm has done an admirable job at organically expanding into Japan, and it is likely that  it will be able to replicate same success in Europe and the U.S.  NetEase Music could see stronger user growth now that Tencent Music was told to end its exclusive licensing agreements with music labels on anti-trust grounds. ",Leadership changes at Activision Blizzard can further delay the launch of much anticipated Diablo Immortal.  Further escalation in geopolitical tensions could keep a lid on NetEases overseas expansions.  Video game pure-plays like NetEase will remain susceptible to changes in the governments stance on games. ,17/11/2023,"NetEase started as a Chinese internet portal in the late 1990s but has now become the second-largest mobile game company in the world. The firm owns one of the most well-known massively multiplayer franchise in ChinaFantasy Westward Journey. Over the past decade, NetEase has capitalized on the industry shift toward mobile gaming and now focuses on developing innovative, high-quality, and long-cycle games with a mobile-first approach. Over the past years, the firm has established iconic titles such as Onmyoji, Knives Out, and Identity V. Every year, the company publishes dozens of games across almost every genre and game play. In addition, NetEase is also collaborating with firms such as Blizzard, Marvel, and Microsoft to release games based on famous global intellectual property like Diablo, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. Over the foreseeable future, we expect NetEase to continue to leverage its in-house research and development team and user data to develop next-generation games. Like its global gaming peers, NetEase maintains a high level of profitability (above 30% operating margin) for its gaming business, thanks to stable revenue from core titles and the steady development of new franchises. We believe the firm is positioned to not only continue capitalizing on the success of Westward Journey titles, but to also keep diversifying its revenue into new franchises.  While games will remain NetEases core cash flow driver, we think the firms investments in other areas (music streaming, online education, e-commerce) also offer long-term potential. Cloud Village, the groups music streaming arm, had over 180 million monthly active users in 2021 and remained the second-largest music streaming platform in China. Youdao is the groups attempt at cracking the online education market, but recent regulatory changes in China add uncertainty to this business model. ","We assign NetEase a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets from its widely recognized intellectual property in the form of compelling game franchises. We believe that NetEase will continue to generate excess returns on capital over the next decade. Games generated more than 70% of NetEases total revenue and more than 100% of its net profit in 2021. The operating margin for the segment has been running at above 30%. Over the past 10 years, NetEase generated an average ROIC of 89%, and we expect the business to generate an average ROIC of 30% for the next decade, well exceeding its weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%.NetEase is the second-largest game publisher in China, with about 20% of the revenue market share in 2021. Over the past decade, China's game industry has seen a shift from PC to mobile, and NetEase has capitalized on the transition and turned itself into a publisher with multiple franchises across mobile and PC. The firm has published a total of more than 30 PC games and 100 mobile games. Some of the most well-known franchises include Fantasy Westward Journey, Westward Journey Online, Onmyoji, and the recently published Naraka Bladepoint.The initial success of NetEase was primarily found in its title, Fantasy Westward Journey (FWJ)one of the most played and highest-grossing franchises over the past two decades. The importance of FWJ to NetEase is comparable to the relationship between World of Warcraft (WoW) and Blizzard. Like WoW, FWJ is a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) that comes with a step learning curve and requires massive time investments. Because playing MMOs requires many combat and non-combat collaborations between different players, virtual relationships (friends, mentors, guilds, or even families) naturally formed between players. These relationships, coupled with deep knowledge of the game and high sunk investments, have effectively kept players sticking around FWJ. This is why the game can maintain a high level of concurrent players after 18 years of launch. With players continuing to spend time in the game, NetEase monetizes their IP year after year through expansion packs, version upgrades, merchandise sales. We estimate that the FWJ franchise contributed to more than 10% of NetEase's game revenue in 2021.NetEase has capitalized on the industry shift toward mobile gaming by (re)developing new high-quality IP with a mobile-first approach. The group's mobile game portfolio has expanded from just 12 titles in 2014 to over 100 in 2021. The mobile version of FWJ was launched in 2015 and remained in the top 10 global highest grossing income in history. Onmyoji is another flagship IP that was developed in-house by NetEase. Since its launch in 2016, Onmyoji's annual revenue has been grossing over CNY 2 billion. The success of the first Onmyoji game has allowed NetEase to create multiple other games based on the same IP but with different genres. In addition to what has already been mentioned, NetEase has also seen successes with self-owned titles like Identity V, Invincible, and Naraka Bladepoint. In essence, we think NetEase's existing portfolio of successful franchises will allow the firm to monetize its intellectual property through in-game microtransactions for an extended period while the firm invests some of these returns into creating more innovative titles.In addition to in-house games, NetEase partners with global leading game developers, mainly Blizzard and Mojang, to publish their popular games in mainland China, which has diversified the genres of NetEase's online games offering. Although we don't think the intangible assets derived from these exclusive licenses are as significant, we believe these partnerships have strengthened NetEase's leading position in China. In addition, we believe that there are certain switching costs for NetEase's partners because all the licensed games are operated on NetEase's servers. If they switch to another local operator, they will need to discontinue the operation of the games for a while for the replacement of the server, which will impact players' experiences. Since 2008, Blizzard has licensed NetEase the exclusive rights to publish its PC-client and mobile games, including StarCraft II series, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Diablo III, and Overwatch.Like other Chinese conglomerates, NetEase has leveraged its online presence and robust profitability from games to create new products in other high-growth categories. Most of these new ventures operate at negative margins to achieve market share, dragging down the overall company's profitability.Youdao is NetEase's online education business, but recent regulatory changes in China add massive uncertainty to this business model. Even before the regulatory crackdown, Youdao has been generating losses since 2017. Given the highly competitive landscape in Chinese online education, we surmise this would be a no-moat business even if the government allows them to profit from after-school academic tutoring.Lastly, we do not have confidence that NetEase's other ventures will generate excess ROICs. This segment (mainly consists of online music streaming and audio live streaming) has been generating operating losses for the group for many years. While its music streaming arm, Cloud Village, is the second-largest one in China, we do not expect the business to achieve operating breakeven until 2025, as it will continue to invest in content acquisition, sales and marketing, and research and development over the next few years. Nonetheless, we are confident that the business will see margin expansion thanks to the cost leverage from increasing subscribers and lower fixed content payment to music labels under nonexclusive agreements.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for NetEase is High.We think that NetEase exhibits high levels of risk, in line with most of the Chinese internet firms under our coverage. Online gamers interest can be unpredictable, switching costs are minimal and competition is intense. NetEase relies on gaming for 70%-80% of revenue, and from 2006 to 2021, the segment's revenue growth has ranged from a low of 2.1% in 2007 to a high of 87% in 2015 during these years. Success or failure in new game launches and legacy game maintenance and expansion packs could lead to significant fluctuations in the growth of gaming revenue and profits.Regulation risks are high in the China internet space. For example, from August 2021 to April 2022, gaming license approval in China was suspended due to the restrictions on underage gaming hours and increasing scrutiny on content of the games. In addition, the government is cracking down on in-game purchase among underage gamers. New and stricter regulations in gaming can put pressure on gaming revenue. We have also examined environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks for NetEase while examining the uncertainty rating. The biggest risk lies in how the Chinese society and its government will view online games. If the government and society increasingly view online games are nothing but another addictive product, companies like NetEase will face more backlashes. This can be seen in anti-addiction measure introduced by the Chinese government in August 2021. Under this rule, Chinese children under the age of 18 can now only play online games for one hour a day and only on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. While the chance might be remote, the government can extend anti-addiction measures to adults. There are other couple potential ESG risk areas to monitor (such as human capital and data privacy) but we do not see any material issues emerging at this moment.","We assign NetEase a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. We view the firms balance sheet as sound-evidenced by its net cash position over the past 10 years. The firm generated free cash flow over the past 10 years and is expected to continue doing so over the foreseeable future.NetEases growth has been mainly driven by organic growth instead of mergers and acquisitions. NetEases R&D investment (which has been growing at nearly 36% the last five years) remains at around 15% of revenue. Returns on those investments are indicated by further growth in players and their monetization. The companys founder and CEO, Ding Lei, has demonstrated a focus on long-term organic investments, which we view as positive. With NetEases overseas ambitions, we expect it to become more active in buying up stakes in small to medium game studios to fill out gaps in development capabilities. Given the business' cash position and the cash flow generation, we believe that NetEase can issue a very large amount of debt to fund any potential acquisitions.Under Dings leadership, NetEase has also expanded into various other internet services such as music, online dictionary, Cloudnote, education, and e-commerce. Some of these investments have done well, while others struggle on the path to profit. Overall, we believe management has a decent approach to capital allocation, which has been proved by strong earnings growth over the past couple of years.NetEase has also being pay dividends, with an average payout ratio of 30% over the past three years. Barring major acquisitions, we expect the company to maintain this dividend policy over the near-term before gradually increasing payout ratio as the business matures.","NetEase, which started on an internet portal service in 1997, is a leading online services provider in China. Its key services include online/mobile games, cloud music, media, advertising, email, live streaming, online education, and e-commerce. The company develops and operates some of the Chinas most popular PC client and mobile games, and it partners with global leading game developers, such as Blizzard Entertainment and Mojang (a Microsoft subsidiary).","NetEase has a rock-solid balance sheet. At the end of December 2021, the company had CNY 98 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and time deposits under current assets. There was also a restricted cash balance of CNY 2.9 billion under current assets. This compares with only CNY 19.4 billion of short-term debt. Thanks to its strong net cash position and strong operating cash flow that amounted to 147% of net income in 2021, we think the firm should have no problem funding its gaming business and innovative businesses. We think NetEase's capital structure is conservative but not uncommon among Chinese internet firms, given that the company needs to have abundant cash on hand to quickly seize opportunities in the fast-changing internet industry and give it a leg up on competition. Given the growth potential in the Chinese internet space, many of these companies under our coverage do not pay dividends. However, NetEase has returned capital to shareholders via dividends and has set quarterly dividends at 20%-30% of its anticipated net income after tax in each quarter starting in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, the company announced the expansion of its share-repurchase program in May 2020, from up to $1 billion worth of outstanding ADSs to $2 billion, this amount was maintained in 2021. At the end of December 2021, approximately $1.8 billion ADSs had been repurchased under such program.",9999.HK,Communication Services,537245057024.0,HKG,9049628.0,HKD,181.3000030517578,True,1,164.7042460613988,159.864322426879,0
24/11/2023,Sun Life's Insurance Businesses Should Benefit From Higher Interest Rates,Sun Life Financial Inc,SLF,3,14/11/2023,Suryansh Sharma,69.65,CAD,23/11/2023,63.0,Medium,,Standard,C,14/11/2023,"No-moat-rated Sun Life Financial reported a middling set of numbers as the company reported underlying net income of CAD 930 million or CAD 1.59 per share in the third quarter versus CAD 949 million or CAD 1.62 per share in the third quarter of the previous year. The third-quarter results equated to an annualized underlying return on equity of 17.7% that is largely in line with managements medium-term guidance of 18%. The company paid a quarterly dividend of CAD 0.78 per share in the third quarter, which represents a 4.7% dividend yield as per the current stock price. We are maintaining our CAD 63 fair value estimate for Sun Life after incorporating the third-quarter results. The underlying earnings in the wealth and asset management business of the company were up 9% on a year-over-year basis as they were reported at CAD 457 million in the third quarter. Assets under management, or AUM, in the MFS business grew 9% on a year-over-year basis to $556 billion, reflecting market appreciation that was partially offset by net outflows. The AUM in the SLC management business grew by 5% on a year-over-year basis to $220 billion driven by market appreciation and net inflows. We note that the wealth and asset management businesses of the company comprised around 42% of overall earnings, which is higher than other peer group companies. The group health and protection segment reported an underlying net income of CAD 285 million, up 1% compared with the previous year on the back of strong revenue growth across all U.S. businesses and better disability experience in Canada that was largely offset by health and protection experience in the U.S. The results in this business were impacted by muted dental business performance in the U.S. as revenue growth was more than offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations and higher investment requirements in the business.","Sun Life has a dominant market position in many segments in the Canadian market and generates decent returns. Sun Life generates about 40% of its earnings from the asset and wealth management segment, which is comparatively less risky and is a source of stable cash flows. The company will be a net beneficiary of rising interest rates in the long run as it can reinvest its maturing fixed-income securities at a higher yield.","Sun Life's asset-management operations may face dual headwinds of fee pressure and lower asset valuations. Sun Life offers a wide range of complex insurance products that exposes it to underwriting, investment, capital market, and interest-rate risks, making it difficult to predict the companys overall risk exposure, especially during periods of economic turbulence. The market for life insurance and income-based retirement products is competitive and commoditized, and it is difficult for companies to find value-accretive growth in mature markets like the U.S. and Canada.",12/09/2023,"Sun Life provides a variety of financial-services products including life insurance, retirement solutions, and investment management, mainly in the U.S., Canada, and Asia. The investment management business of the company has achieved adequate scale and is a source of stable earnings and cash flows. The companys strategic priorities include investing in digital tools and services, deepening the synergies between the asset management and insurance businesses, realizing scale benefits, and enhancing capabilities through M&A and partnerships. Following the 2008-09 financial crisis, Sun Life made several positive changes to its business operations, most notably selling its lagging U.S. life insurance and annuities business. We believe that steps like this have resulted in reducing the overall risk profile of the company. The companys current business mix is adequately diversified with a 40% contribution from asset and wealth management, 21% from traditional long-duration insurance, and 39% from group and shorter-duration insurance, which is relatively less risky. Sun Lifes medium-term objectives include underlying EPS growth of 8%-10%, underlying returns on equity of more than 18%, and a dividend payout rate of 40%-50% of underlying profits. Sun Life has a leading market position in Canada in the individual life and health insurance business. It is also a market leader in Canadian group benefits and group retirement services, which include defined contribution business and defined benefit solutions. In the U.S., the company is more focused on the group benefits market, which includes products like life, disability, absence management, dental, vision, accident, and critical illness. The company has been generating strong returns in its U.S. and Canadian businesses, but returns in the Asia segment have been lagging due to its relatively weak market positions. Sun Life, like other life insurers, has its financial results tied to interest rates. Rising interest rates should be beneficial in the near term, but we do not expect long-term rates to return to pre-financial-crisis levels.","We assign a Morningstar economic moat rating of none to Sun Life Financial because of the unfavorable competitive dynamics in the industry. The life insurance industry is fiercely competitive with most insurance and annuities being undifferentiated and commoditized. Whether sold individually or to employers, we believe that pricing is the primary driver for customers buying Sun Lifes products. Additionally, the relatively low fixed costs in the insurance business model do not lend themselves to a cost-based competitive advantage.We acknowledge that certain adjacent businesses such as asset management can have narrow moats, but on a consolidated basis, these businesses are not large enough for us to have confidence that they will result in consistent returns on equity exceeding the cost of equity for the whole company.Industry DynamicsThe upside potential for life insurance and income-related products is capped by the market dynamics and the additional margins that are built into the products for extreme events. The company can earn outsize returns in the short run but those returns will be lowered by increased competition or additional regulation in the long run. However, there is no floor for policies that are poorly underwritten. As we have seen in prior periods, poor underwriting can put pressure on the company for many years and even result in bankruptcy. Insurers do not know their cost of goods sold for many years, allowing them to underprice policies without knowing it. Managers at firms may also have an incentive to chase growth without regard for profitability, a cycle in which competitors are forced to match low prices or risk losing business. Due to these reasons, disciplined underwriting is particularly crucial in the life insurance industry.Sun Life is among the Big Three of the Canadian life insurance industry that also includes Great-West Life and Manulife. Fitch Ratings estimates that the three large Canadian life insurers represent more than two thirds of the Canadian market. In Canada, Sun Life provides retirement products and life, health, and other insurance solutions to employers as well as individuals through multiple channels. The company is the largest player in the individual life and health insurance market in Canada when measured by premiums. It also holds a dominant market position in the lucrative group benefits segment in Canada where products like life, dental, extended healthcare, disability, and critical illness are sold through long-standing relationships with corporate employers. This business is relatively capital-light and entails lower risk because the company can reprice its products quickly based on experience. Sun Life also provides defined-contribution pension plans and defined-benefit solutions in Canada and is a market leader in the group retirement services segment. The company was ranked first in the defined-contribution market based on total plan assets as per the 2020 Fraser Pension Universe Report. It was also ranked first in the defined benefit solutions annuity market as per LIMRA in 2021. Despite the size and strong market share of the company, we do not see evidence of competitive advantages over its peers, given the competitive intensity and product structures in the Canadian life insurance industry.Sun Lifes U.S. business is mainly focused on the group benefits segment, where it provides group insurance products and services to corporate employers. The company has built this business through both organic and inorganic investments over the past decades. The company acquired Assurant Employee Benefits in 2016, which brought new group benefits capabilities. In 2018, it acquired Maxwell Health to enhance the digital enrollment experience for employees of small- and medium-size businesses. The company acquired PinnacleCare in 2021 to strengthen its product capabilities and competitive positioning in the stop-loss business. The company has leadership positions in various niches of the group benefits business. For example, Sun Life is the largest independent medical stop-loss provider and largest turnkey disability provider. With the recent acquisition of DentaQuest, Sun Life is the second-largest provider of dental benefits in the U.S. Overall, the company is among the top 10 providers of group benefit services in the U.S. as per the LIMRA 2020 report. Sun Life also services more than 90,000 individual in-force life insurance policies in the U.S., but it does not actively sell new policies. We expect the earnings contribution from the U.S. life insurance business to reduce over time as these policies roll off the book.Sun Lifes Asia business provides asset management, wealth, protection, and health solutions through a multichannel distribution approach in eight countries. It also offers specialized insurance and wealth products for high-net-worth individuals in these markets through its international hubs business unit. Sun Life is the largest insurance company in the Philippines based on total premiums and is also the largest mutual fund provider. Except for the Philippines, the company does not have a dominant market position in any of the other Asian markets where it operates. The relatively weak competitive positioning of the company in its Asian markets is also reflected in the returns of the segment. The company has earned around 10% adjusted underlying return on equity from this segment in the past three years compared with midteens adjusted underlying ROE from Canada and the U.S. segment.Sun Lifes asset management business is composed of MFS and Sun Life Capital Management and reported above CAD 1 trillion of assets under management and administration as of the second quarter of 2023. MFS was acquired by Sun Life in 1982 and competes primarily in the global institutional, U.S. retail, and select non-U.S. retail markets. MFS accounts for approximately 77% of AUM in the investment management segment with a diversified asset class and investor mix82% of MFS AUM is in equities and 13% in fixed income, with the rest in balanced funds. In terms of investor mix, 54% of AUM is from U.S. retail, 32% from institutional clients, and the rest from insurance and non-U.S. retail clients. We believe that MFS has achieved adequate scale in the U.S. market and is the 10th-largest U.S. retail fund manager. The firm's attractive record and broad portfolio of products should enable it to generate positive flows in the long run. Active asset managers like MFS continue to face headwinds from passive investment products and downward pressure on fees. To address these headwinds, management plans to grow its retail business outside the U.S. and diversify its global business with fixed-income products.Sun Life Capital Management provides liability-driven investments, fixed-income, and real estate solutions in the U.S. and Canada and accounts for approximately 23% of AUM in the investment management segment. SLC Management leverages Sun Lifes long-standing expertise in LDI and private asset class investments to offer customized investment solutions to institutional investors. The investment capabilities that the company uses for its clients are arguably the same capabilities that are used in managing its general account. In terms of investor mix, 50% of AUM came from pension funds, 24% from insurance companies, and the rest from trusts and others. Consistent with moat ratings for other asset managers, we believe that the asset management segment has a narrow moat driven by switching costs and intangible assets. However, Sun Lifes asset management segment contributes approximately 35% of the companys overall earnings, so it is not large enough to affect the companys overall moat rating.Global Financial CrisisThe profitability of life insurance policies and other income-related products is highly contingent on implied actuarial assumptions and product pricing. The life insurance business model typically entails interest rate, investment, and underwriting risks and potentially exposes the industry to outlier capital market events that can lead to unanticipated divergence from the implied actuarial assumptions. Recent periods of economic turbulence like the global financial crisis have shown that the traditional life insurance industry has underwritten complex products and has taken on additional risks beyond mortality and morbidity, thereby exposing the industry to other systematic risks. Also, the complexity, diversity, and limited disclosures into the details of these products and the extensive use of opaque derivatives have made it very difficult to understand the inherent risk profile and exposure of life insurance companies in stressful market environments.Variable annuities with living and death benefit guarantees were partially responsible for the stress on the life insurance industry during the global financial crisis. Minimum benefit guarantees and other similar products offered downside guarantees to the customers, thereby exposing the underwriter of these products to capital market risks. These products gained popularity during the 2000s with their sales being highly correlated with the stock market. The stock market optimism in the mid-2000s resulted in insurers offering the most generous terms on these policies with the most unfavorable risk and return characteristics. We can think about underwriting VA guarantees as writing a put option on the market. The underwriter of these products is highly leveraged to the market because of the option-like characteristics and the VA fees being contingent on AUM levels that are also partially dependent on the market. When the market rises, the put option (guarantees) move out of money and the VA fees also increase because of higher AUM. On the other hand, when the market goes down the VA fees reduce and the put option (guarantees) moves in money thereby increasing the embedded liabilities.In addition to this, insurance companies booked heavy credit losses on their investment portfolios due to the economic turbulence, pressuring the statutory capital ratios of the companies and raising solvency related concerns. The global financial crisis demonstrated the complicated and to some extent opaque nature of potential liabilities and showed that outlier capital market events can have a significant impact on insurance companies. Having said this, we believe that the industry has become more cognizant of the risks that they are taking and has tightened its underwriting standards after the financial crisis. Currently, the industry as a whole and the company are much better positioned to steer through an extended recession, but we think that investors should still consider these risks.Intangible AssetsLarge and renowned insurance companies like Sun Life have often emphasized that their brand is a differentiating factor. A well-known brand can certainly be helpful, but we do not believe that it leads to pricing power as insurance is mostly a commoditized industry. As an example of how life insurance is commoditized, there are plenty of websites that allow prospective buyers to compare rates for life insurance policies with similar terms.Sun Life is among the largest insurance underwriters in the Canadian market, which means that it should have some advantage in leveraging its proprietary database to better price and select risks than smaller peers, and recent investments in technology should allow it to better exploit this potential advantage. However, we believe it is especially difficult to develop a knowledge-based intangible asset moat in the life insurance industry as underwriting risks are easily understood and contract structures are largely homogenous.Established insurance companies like Sun Life have risk management, product development, and investment management capabilities that have been developed over decades and will be difficult to replicate for a newer entrant. Having said this, insurance is a mature industry with a high degree of competition among existing incumbents, and we do not think that the company has a market intelligence or a technical know-how advantage compared with other competitors of similar size.We believe that the asset management business of the company benefits from intangible assets (such as strong and respected brands and manager reputations derived from successful track records of investment performance), which can provide it with a degree of differentiation from its peers. While the barriers to entry are not all that significant for the industry, the barriers to success are extremely high as it not only takes time and skill to put together a long enough record of investment performance to start gathering assets but even more time to build the scale necessary to remain competitive. This has generally provided the larger, more established asset managers like Sun Life with an advantage over the smaller players in the industry, especially when it comes to gaining cost-effective access to distribution platforms. But we don't think Sun Lifes asset management business is large enough to affect the firms overall moat rating.Cost Advantage Policy acquisition costs that are incurred up front and amortized over the period of the policy represent a sizable expense for life insurance companies. Therefore, having an efficient distribution system for selling its products is a key determinant of profitability in the life insurance industry. A costly customer acquisition channel can lead to higher pricing of the product, which will make the company uncompetitive in the market, or it can lead to lower margins. Sun Lifes scale allows it to leverage various distribution channels to sell its broad portfolio of products.Sun Life is one of the largest players in many of its markets, but it is far from dominant with respect to market share. We think that having a large scale is somewhat beneficial as it allows the company to invest in technological capabilities, better leverage its distribution channel, offer a comprehensive product portfolio, and provide cost-effective customer service. However, the life insurance industry has relatively few fixed costs, thereby limiting the advantages of scale. Moreover, the larger competitors of the company also have comparable scale, negating a competitive advantage to Sun Life. Overall, we believe that the company benefits from its scale, but it is not material enough to constitute a cost advantage-based moat.Switching CostsMost life insurance policies and other income-related products are typically priced when a new business is written and corresponding liabilities for future benefits are established based on various underlying actuarial assumptions like mortality, lapse rate, and investment returns. Generally speaking, insurance policies and other income protection products have long durations, but companies seldom have the ability to reprice the products or adjust premiums on the products that were previously sold. Since the company has limited opportunities to reprice its previously sold products, the high retention rate of existing policies does not translate into pricing power. In addition to this, customers can easily buy insurance products from multiple insurance companies based on pricing as there is no substantial benefit to buying all required products from the same insurance provider. This indicates a lack of switching costs for customers, especially in the retail channel.Lapse rates, which are essentially annualized attrition rates, vary by product with fixed-annuity and variable-annuity products typically having higher lapse rates. The voluntary termination rate for life insurance policies, which includes the lapse rate and surrender rate, was around 5.5%-6.8% over the past decade for the U.S. life insurance industry as per data from the American Council of Life Insurers. The termination rate for life insurance products declined to 5.0% in 2020 due to the pandemic, but we expect this number to normalize to prepandemic levels in the upcoming years.Having said this, Sun Lifes group insurance business in the U.S. and Canada and its asset management business somewhat benefit from switching costs. In the asset management business, although the switching costs might not be explicitly large, inertia and the uncertainty of achieving better results by moving from one asset manager to another tend to keep many investors invested with the same funds for extended periods. As a result, money that flows into asset management firms tends to stay there. For the asset management industry as a whole, the average redemption (retention) rate, has been around 25% or less (75% or greater) annually during the past 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year time frames. In the group insurance business, the products have relatively more stickiness because they are sold to and through corporate employers with long-standing relationships, and the company has an opportunity to reprice its product offering based on experience every couple of years. Further, it is logistically a hassle for employers to switch to another provider and there are no clear benefits of switching to a different provider. As an example, the companys peer MetLife has reported persistency of over 96% in its U.S. group insurance business. We think that there are some traces of switching cost advantages in both the group insurance business and the asset management, but it is not material enough for us to award a moat to the entire company.ConclusionWe use adjusted return on equity to determine whether a company has shown or is forecast to have the characteristics of an economic moat. We calculate adjusted return on equity by adjusting the equity to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income. We have included goodwill in the ROE calculation since the company has had a history of various acquisitions and allocating capital for opportunistic inorganic growth is part of managements capital allocation framework. The idea behind these adjustments is to evaluate the profitability of the core business by excluding highly volatile components that flow through the financial statements of the company. Even with the high-margin, capital-light asset management business Sun Life has achieved an average adjusted ROE that is only slightly above our assumed cost of equity of 11%. The average return of the core insurance business should fall below the cost of equity if we exclude the wealth and asset management segments from the overall numbers. We expect the adjusted ROE of the core insurance business of the company to remain below our cost of equity over the projected period. Therefore, we believe there is currently not enough quantitative or qualitative evidence to support a moat for Sun Life.","Life insurance companies establish liabilities for future benefits that are payable under insurance policies based on various underlying actuarial assumptions like mortality, lapse rate, investment returns, and so on. Various retirement and income products sold by the company also expose the company to capital market and investment risks. An adverse market environment, unpredictable product performance, or unexpected insurance claims can potentially destroy several years of earnings or even put an insurer out of business. Overall, Sun Life has generally been prudent and has reduced the systematic risk in its business after the global financial crisis, but the risks inherent to the industry should not be ignored.Additionally, the complexity of the products and the limited disclosures make it very difficult to understand the inherent risk profile of life insurance companies in stressful market environments.The company is also exposed to interest-rate risk. A sharp movement in interest rates can drastically change the market value of its fixed-income portfolio and also alter the profitability of the company as it has to reinvest its cash flows at different interest rates. As of the second quarter of 2023, Sun Lifes earnings sensitivity to a 10% decline in equity markets was negative CAD 150 million and the potential impact on other comprehensive income of a 50-basis-point increase in interest rates was negative CAD 225 million.From an environmental, social, and governance perspective, we view the largest risks as stemming from business ethics and product governance issues. Additionally, given Sun Life's millions of customers, failure to keep personal data secure could harm the company. We believe that management has adequately managed ESG risks thus far.We assign Sun Life a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.","We assign Sun Life Financial a Standard rating under our capital allocation methodology. In our opinion, the companys balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate.We believe that the company is in good financial health with an appropriate capital structure and adequate liquidity to weather difficult economic environments and access future investment opportunities. The investment management business is a source of durable cash flows for the company. We believe that Sun Lifes balance sheet strategy is appropriate for its business model. The company has a LICAT ratio of 148% as of the second quarter of 2023, well above the 100% supervisory target of the Canadian regulatory authority. In addition to this, the company also maintains a decent liquidity buffer at the holding company level. Like its peers, Sun Life has strong financial strength ratings of A or above for its various entities from the credit rating agencies (S&P, Moodys, Fitch, and A.M. Best). The company had financial leverage of 23.3% as of the second quarter of 2023, which we think is manageable given its cash flows. We think that Sun lifes capital, liquidity, and debt levels are suitable given the risk profile of its business.We view the firms capital investment decisions as fair. Sun Lifes adjusted return on equity has been above its cost of equity over the past several years with strong returns in the asset management, Canada, and U.S. segments and relatively weaker returns in the Asia segment. Management expects an adjusted return on equity to be in the mid- to high teens in the long run.Sun Life has a four-pillar acquisition strategy in which any deal needs to meet at least one of the following: It must add scale, add capabilities, deliver lifetime return on equity with the firms medium-term objective, or be accretive to earnings over a reasonable time frame. In asset management, we expect more consolidation in the industry and expect Sun Life to participate. In 2019, it acquired real estate investment firm BentallGreenOak and in 2020 announced a majority stake in Crescent Capital and Infrared Capital Partners, both of which are alternative asset managers. While a large acquisition in the asset management industry is possible, Sun Life would have to carefully weigh the capital required and the potential for disruption to its existing operations.In the insurance space, Sun Life swung big with its $2.5 billion acquisition of DentaQuest, which was completed in June 2022. This acquisition follows other acquisitions in the U.S. benefits space over the past decade like Assurant Employee Benefits in 2016, Maxwell Health in 2018, and PinnacleCare in 2021. We think that the DentaQuest acquisition makes strategic sense for the company as it should help Sun Life to grow its U.S. benefits business and significantly enhance its competitive positioning in the dental benefits market. From a valuation perspective, DentaQuest was acquired at around 14 times estimated earnings, and the transaction was expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and ROE. Overall, we believe that Sun Life has done a decent job at inorganic transactions over the past decade.Kevin Strain became CEO in August 2021, replacing Dean Connor, who had led the firm since December 2011. Strain was executive vice president and CFO before taking the helm. Under Connors tenure, Sun Life recovered from the global financial crisis, refocused on its core insurance operations, and moved to derisk aspects of its business, such as selling its U.S. annuity unit. Connor also placed greater emphasis on the Asian market and asset management operations. We expect the company to remain focused on its long-term strategic priorities under the new leadership.We assess the companys capital return strategy as appropriate, especially given its business mix. In 2019 and 2020, Sun Life returned about CAD 1.9 billion and CAD 1.6 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. The company returned approximately CAD 1.4 billion and CAD 1.7 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively, mostly through dividends. Overall, the company has returned approximately CAD 9.8 billion to shareholders in the last six years through dividends and share repurchases. The capital returned to shareholders over the last six years amounts to approximately 60% of the companys GAAP earnings, which we think is suitable given the growth and capital requirements of the company.","Sun Life provides life insurance, retirement, and asset management products to individuals and corporate customers in Canada, the United States, and Asia. The companys investment management business contributes approximately 38% of its adjusted earnings and has around CAD 1 trillion in assets under management as of the second quarter of 2023. The Canada business contributes about 32% of adjusted earnings and provides individual life and health insurance, group insurance, retirement services, and wealth management solutions. The U.S. business contributes approximately 14% of earnings and is mainly focused on providing group insurance products and managing the in-force life insurance policies. Finally, the Asia segment contributes around 16% of earnings.","The life insurance business model typically entails significant leverage and potentially exposes the industry to outlier capital market events and unanticipated actuarial changes. Sun Life is not immune to these risks, and recessionary periods like the global financial crisis have shown the importance of disciplined underwriting and adequate capitalization.Insurance failures can be caused by various factors including investment, underwriting, and interest-rate risks. Sun Life manages its consolidated capital in compliance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test guidelines. The LICAT ratio is the sum of the available capital, surplus allowance, and eligible deposits divided by the firms base solvency buffer. In other words, the LICAT ratio can be thought of as a measure of capital adequacy as it measures an insurers ability to pay out claims in unfavorable conditions. Sun Life had a LICAT ratio of 148% as of the second quarter of 2023, which is comfortably above the supervisory target of 100% and the regulatory minimum requirement of 90%.The leverage ratio is another important consideration in determining Sun Lifes financial strengths and credit ratings. It is calculated as the sum of long-term debt, capital instruments, preferred shares, and other equity, divided by the sum of long-term debt, capital instruments, and total equity. The firm had a leverage ratio of 23.3% as of the second quarter of 2023, which we think is appropriate given its risk profile. The equity/assets ratio (excluding separate accounts) was 13.2% at the end of 2022, which is largely in line with the long-term average. The company had cash and other liquid assets of CAD 2.0 billion at the holding company level as of the second quarter of 2023, which is higher than the long-term management target. Overall, we think that Sun Life has a strong balance sheet with a robust capital position and adequate liquidity.",SLF.TO,Financial Services,40217022464.0,TOR,1485554.0,CAD,69.80000305175781,True,0,64.7545517512726,69.83071145779024,0
24/11/2023,"Cencora Expands Top Line on GLP-1s and Specialty Products, but Margins Narrow",Cencora Inc,COR,2,03/11/2023,Keonhee Kim,199.68,USD,23/11/2023,176.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,A,03/11/2023,"Narrow-moat Cencora, formerly known as AmerisourceBergen, reported solid fourth-quarter results that were above our expectations, wrapping up fiscal 2023 on good footing. Total quarterly sales were up 12.7% year over year as demand for specialty products and GLP-1 medications (for diabetes and weight loss) continue to boost sales. Management also provided healthy guidance for fiscal 2024; it expects U.S. healthcare revenue to be up 7%-10% for the full year, international healthcare to be up 4%-8%, and adjusted diluted EPS to grow roughly 6%-8% despite lowered contributions from COVID-19-related items. After baking in these numbers and rolling our cash flow model, we are raising our fair value estimate to $176 per share from $162. U.S. healthcare solutions was up 13.0% year over year as utilization trends remain strong. A notable driver during the quarter was once again GLP-1s, which made up roughly 300 basis points of growth by themselves. As we have noted for other pharmaceutical distributors we cover, we think the growth in GLP-1s is a double-edge sword, since the drugs boost the top line but also carry thin margins and weigh down the bottom line. Cencora discussed a number of higher-margin services it offers to manufacturers, retailers, and pharmacists that could offset some of the margin losses, but the outsize headwinds from GLP-1s have masked those results in recent quarters. We expect a similar trend for the near term. International healthcare was up 9.5%, thanks to a healthy performance from the global specialty logistics business. PharmaLex, which Cencora acquired at the beginning of the year, continues to show nice growth through consumer penetration and geographic expansion. These services are higher-margin compared with Cencoras base drug distribution business, so opportunistic investments in the business and successful execution could be margin-accretive over the long term.","Cencora distributes pharmaceutical products to nearly one third of the industry, leading to substantial negotiation leverage with generic drug manufacturers. A direct-to-store model is becoming more popular among retailers (representing 93% of sales in 2017, up from 74% in 2007), solidifying Cencora's role in the supply chain. Technology advancements continue to improve Cencora's performance and present new opportunities for wholesalers.","Reimbursement pressures on pharmacy and provider customers have led to an emphasis on cost containment, pressuring Cencora's profitability. Scrutiny from the public and politicians over exorbitant branded and specialty drug list prices could result in lower price inflation long term, slowing Cencora's top-line growth. Pharmacy distribution through mail service has risen quicker than the customers that Cencora serves, potentially acting as a headwind to top-line growth.",03/11/2023,"Cencora is one of three leading domestic wholesalers of branded, generic, and specialty pharmaceutical products. With over $200 billion in annual U.S. healthcare distribution sales, the company supplies roughly one third of the domestic drug distribution market. Its two close competitors are Cardinal Health and McKesson. Together, the three operate as a pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution oligopoly, supplying over 90% of the U.S. market. Cencora simplifies distribution logistics by shipping products to centralized wholesaler locations, as opposed to shipping directly to pharmacies and various customer locations. Additionally, Cencora takes legal ownership of its suppliers products and absorbs all inventory and credit risk associated with delinquent pharmacies, clinics, and providers. We expect the U.S. distribution space to continue to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit rate over the next five years, fueled by an aging population, introduction of new pharmaceuticals, and increased use of specialty medicines. We believe Cencora is well positioned to enjoy these dynamics and expect it to maintain its leading position over our forecast period. The company has partnerships with some of the biggest customers in U.S. drug distribution, including Walgreens, Cigna, and Kaiser Permanente, so the rising demand for pharmaceutical products will be a nice tailwind for its top line.  In 2021, Cencora expanded its international presence by purchasing Alliance Healthcare, one of the leading drug wholesalers in Europe. European drug distribution has over 750 smaller full-line wholesalers, but three main distributorsAlliance, Celesio, and Phoenixcontrol roughly 80% of overall distribution in the region. Beyond distribution, Alliance provides consulting and logistical services, which are higher-margin businesses, to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cencora has since acquired PharmaLex, which provides business and consulting support to biopharma firms.","We assign Cencora a narrow moat rating because we believe the characteristics of the U.S. drug distribution market and the unlikelihood that customers will move to a different distributor (switching costs) should uphold the companys competitive position and continue to support economic profits for at least the next 10 years. Pharmaceutical wholesalers fill a central role in the supply chain for prescription drugs with over 90% of all prescription drugs in the United States going through wholesalers. While pharmaceutical distribution is their cornerstone, drug wholesalers have a complex role that extends beyond distribution and have developed essential partnerships with their customers. By contracting directly with manufacturers for branded and generic pharmaceuticals (and leveraging their substantial purchasing power), the big three wholesalers (McKesson, Cencora , and Cardinal Health) are able to consistently negotiate for the lowest rates on the market, typically significantly below the wholesale acquisition cost. Additionally, a full-line wholesaler will typically stock over 21,000 stock-keeping units associated with prescription drugs and negotiate with around 1,200 different manufacturers, a task less efficiently accomplished by retail pharmacies on their own. The three big wholesalers act as an oligopoly. They make up over 90% of the overall U.S. drug distribution market, effectively servicing the market, and they have done so for the past 20-plus years. We anticipate most of the market to continue to be serviced by these three players over the next 10 years, with minor changes in market share among them.Drug distributors work extremely efficiently and effectively to service their customers. Their largest customer base is chain pharmacies/stores, but they also serve independent pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, and mail-service pharmacies. Most of the top 15 pharmacies by sales in the U.S., which make up nearly 75% of overall pharmacy industry prescription revenue, have some sort of partnership with one or more of the three big wholesalers that have lasted for many years. In 2020, approximately 85% of dispensed prescription drugs in the U.S. were sold to retailers, which includes chain pharmacies and mass merchandisers (55%), independent pharmacies (15%), and food stores (13%). The three wholesalers already have long-standing relationships with the biggest retail pharmacies. Also, retail pharmacies are growing faster than other customers; since 2017, they have increased at an average rate of 2.8% compared with a decline of 0.9% in mail orders.Cencora covers roughly a third of the U.S. drug distribution market. Walgreens, the firms largest customer, made up roughly 32% of total distribution revenue, or over $64 billion, in fiscal 2022. Cencora also serves Cigna, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, and Kaiser, which made up 13%, 6%, and 5% of total distribution revenue, respectively. It extended its pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Walgreens through 2029. This is a mutually beneficial situation for both companies for a multitude of reasons. Walgreens is Cencora's largest customer and has been for more than 10 years. Knowledge that is gained over the years of partnership is hard to replicate with a new wholesaler. This is especially true for big retailers because we estimate that Cencora has specific coordination and management systems that could take months to develop for a new distributor. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that a customer will get better pricing by switching from Cencora to either Cardinal Health or McKesson because the cost of time lost during a transition and restructuring phase would not make it viable for a new distributor to offer better rebates than the original distributor. Distributors also offer consulting, logistics, and data and analytics services to its customers. We estimate that Cencora offers different and customized services to its customers, especially its big retailer customers, so both the distributor and customers can work at maximum efficiency and effectiveness. We believe these services make the relationship between Cencora and its customers stickier. For customers, switching to a new distributor would mean loss of operational expertise that they have achieved over the years of working with their original distributor. In our view, these combined reasons act as a catalyst behind big retailers sticking with their distributors and locking down their relationships with long partnerships. This can be seen from the fact that there have not been any major retailers switching their distributors during the last 10 years, and we expect this trend to continue for the next 10 years. Cencora also sources generic drugs through its generic procurement joint venture that it has with Walgreens. The joint venture, started in 2012, combines the purchasing power of Cencora and Walgreens to obtain strong buy-side margins from generic drug manufacturers. This is crucial for a drug distributors profitability because while generic drugs make up roughly 10% of wholesalers top line, they make up over two thirds of their gross profit. Since there are multiple generic drug manufacturers that aim to effectively produce the same drug, they have to compete with each other to win over a contract with one of the three big wholesalers. This provides major pricing power to Cencora, compared with purchasing branded drugs, which helps them drive a significantly higher margin from generic drugs. Switching costs would entail unraveling of the joint venture and result in pharmacies facing higher acquisition costs for generics, which constitute the vast majority of dispensing volume. Since Walgreens has a financial stake in this relationship, it is highly unlikely that it will stop working with Cencora and move to a new distributor, especially in the next 10 years.","We assign Cencora a Medium Uncertainty Rating, which reflects our analysis of the firm based on the historical volatility of the stock partly driven by some risk in fluctuations in drug prices.Price volatility of branded, specialty, and generic drugs heavily influences Cencora's top-line growth and operating margins. Since many factors, including inflation rate, competition, and drug effectiveness, are used to determine drug prices, wholesalers are subject to risks that are not under their control. Branded and specialty drugs make up a small portion of dispensed prescriptions, but their high average list prices have an outsize impact on a wholesalers top line. In 2021, they represented around 15% of dispensed drug volume in the U.S. but made up roughly 85% of pharmaceutical spending. Rising awareness of climbing list prices and calls for more price transparency threaten to slow long-term drug price inflation. If these pressures persist, Cencora will need to find ways to mitigate risks associated with slower price inflation.Compared with branded and specialty drugs, generic drugs have an opposite effect on wholesalers. Despite carrying materially lower price tags, generic drugs make up the majority of Cencora's gross profits. Since there are many different versions of generic drugs from various manufacturers, wholesalers have more purchasing power compared with when they purchase branded drugs. After 2015, generic drugs saw their prices drop due to their growing availability from the increased number of Food and Drug Administration approvals and more competition, thinning wholesalers margins. While generic drug prices appeared to have stabilized recently, any further volatility or deflation threatens to keep compressing Cencora's margins.","We assign Cencora a Standard Capital Allocation Rating. This reflects our forward-looking assessments of the firm's financial health, investment strategy and efficacy (organic and inorganic), and shareholder distribution policy. Our Standard rating is a function of our sound balance sheet, fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distribution ratings.We rate Cencora's balance sheet as sound, with medium business risk. Revenue cyclicality is low, with minimal seasonality and sales largely unassociated with broader macroeconomic trends. This is due to inelastic demand for prescription drugs and wholesalers essential role as an intermediary in the supply chain. The company has substantial working capital on the balance sheet thanks to the high cost associated with products it distributes. Pharmaceutical wholesalers take title, or legal ownership, over the drugs they distribute, and the substantial inventory, receivables, and payables on the balance sheet reflect the nature of wholesalers role. However, Cencora's favorable cash conversion cycle mitigates this balance sheet risk. Over the last five years, company has averaged a cash conversion cycle of roughly negative 10 days, which means it can unload its inventory and gets paid by its customers before it has to pay its suppliers. Cencora also has a healthy cash balance and generates substantial cash from operations to cover its future short-term debts.We rate Cencora's investment strategy as fair. The company has historically been highly acquisitive, adding depth to its U.S. distribution business, animal health business, specialty and provider services, and consulting and data analytics services. A notable recent acquisition is the 2021 purchase of Alliance Healthcare from Walgreens for $6.3 billion. Cencora had a presence in Europe through World Courier, a global specialty distribution business it acquired in 2012, but Alliance adds significant depth to its European business. Roughly 80% of European pharmaceutical distribution is controlled by three major players, with Alliance being one of them, and we expect Cencora to enjoy a nice tailwind from this acquisition. Alliance also has consulting and pharmaceutical logistical services businesses as well as a network of independent pharmacies to which it provides group purchasing organization services, all of which have higher margins than the domestic drug distribution business.We rate Cencora's shareholder distribution as appropriate. The company has consistently increased its dividends year over year and now distributes $0.51 per share quarterly. We merit Cencora for utilizing its strong balance sheet and consistently positive cash flow from operations to return value to shareholders. We expect the company to continue this trend and average a payout ratio of 20% over the next five years. The company has also repurchased billions of dollars worth of shares over the past several years, as it has a consistent record of generating strong free cash flows from operating activities. Cencora is expected to pay roughly $6.4 billion over 18 years in association with opioid litigation. Even after factoring in the anticipated impact to future cash flows, we still expect Cencora to generate substantial free cash flow.","Cencora is one of three domestic leading pharmaceutical wholesalers. It sources and distributes branded, generic, and specialty pharmaceutical products to pharmacies (retail chains, independent, and mail order), hospital networks, and healthcare providers. It and McKesson and Cardinal Health constitute over 90% of the U.S. pharmaceutical wholesale industry. Cencora also provides commercialization services for manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, global specialty drug logistics (World Courier), and animal health product distribution (MWI Animal Health). Cencora expanded its international presence in 2021 by purchasing Alliance Healthcare, one of the leading drug wholesalers in Europe.","As of fiscal year-end 2023, Cencora had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion and roughly $4.2 billion in outstanding debt. About a third of debt is due to mature over the next three years, and we expect Cencora to generate more than enough cash from operations to cover its liabilities. Drug distributors benefit from securing multiyear partnerships with big retailers (chain drugstores, mail, and specialty pharmacies) and nonretail customers (group purchasing organizations, long-term care, government). And since the majority of their revenue stems from their top 10 customers, having agreements that go well into the future lessons major volatility in distributors top line, barring any significant customer consolidation. For Cencora, around two thirds of its overall sales in fiscal 2022 were generated by its top 10 customers. Walgreens and Express Scripts, Cencora's two largest customers, accounted for roughly 27% and 13% of the companys total sales, respectively. Cencora has agreements to serve both of those customers through 2026. We also do not expect any shifts among the big three's major customers in the next five years. Although roughly a third of each distributors customers are up for renewal every year, we have not seen any notable customer switch over from one distributor to another, and we expect this trend to continue.Cencora has posted a negative cash conversion cycle (receivable days plus inventory days minus payable days) over the last 10 years, which means the company purchased and sold goods before it paid its suppliers. A negative cash conversion cycle also suggests that the business is efficiently turning over its working capital and has greater liquidity. We credit this to Cencora's strong negotiation leverage with its suppliers and customers, some of whom it has worked with for many years.",COR,Healthcare,40992292864.0,NYQ,1200688.0,USD,199.67999267578125,True,0,185.02686947093648,220.29205736702096,1

Coinciding with the release, Ceridian announced joint CEO Leagh Turner will depart the firm in November 2023 after a five-year tenure. While we are disappointed to see another leadership change in close succession to the announced departure of CFO Noemie Heuland, we do not expect Turners departure to affect the firms strategy or outlook. Ceridian recently announced plans to rebrand as ""Dayforce,"" signaling an ongoing commitment to the firms flagship cloud human capital management, or HCM, platform.

Except for an announced amortization charge of $21 million per quarter for two years relating to the Ceridian brand, we don't factor in additional profitability impacts. Third-quarter revenue rose 20% year on year, reflecting healthy Dayforce client base growth aided by internal platform migrations and continued traction in the enterprise market, and uplift from interest income revenue. These tailwinds were once again offset by declining revenue from legacy solutions and flat Powerpay revenue. Ceridian continues to skew upmarket and successfully sell a broader suite of solutions with the support of system integrator partners, fueling average Dayforce recurring revenue per client growth of 17% at quarter-end, marginally ahead of our forecasts.","We expect greater uptake of add-on modules and ancillary functionality such as Dayforce Wallet to entrench Ceridians software further in a clients business, increasing client stickiness.  Increasing regulatory complexity under a Democratic administration should create tailwinds for the payroll and HCM industry.  Ceridians expansion into prepaid pay cards allows the company to earn lucrative interchange revenue and leverage its exposure to its clients employees and their earned wages. ","We expect fierce competitive pressures and powerful clients to limit pricing growth and force Ceridian to maintain high investment in software development and innovation.  We view Ceridians offering as largely commoditized, exposing the company to a higher risk of pricing pressure.  Ceridians continuous payroll capabilities once provided a competitive edge, but this functionality has since been replicated by competitors. ",02/11/2023,"Ceridian HCM offers payroll and human capital management solutions via its flagship Dayforce platform, secondary platform Powerpay, and legacy Bureau products. The company has taken share of the expansive and growing HCM market through the appeal of its agile cloud-based solutions that offer an alternative to legacy on-premises solutions or solutions cobbled together using multiple databases or platforms. Ceridian derives most of its revenue from Dayforce, which is geared to larger enterprises wishing to streamline human resources operations across multiple jurisdictions and leverage the platforms scalable infrastructure. To maximize revenue per client and entrench its software further in a clients business, Ceridian continues to expand the functionality of Dayforce by rolling out new add-on modules and features. As a result, we estimate per employee per month revenue for a client adopting the full suite of Dayforce modules increased at a 30% compound annual growth rate over the three years to fiscal 2021, to about $50. In addition to traditional modules, Ceridian expanded Dayforces functionality into the adjacent market of preloaded pay cards with the rollout of Dayforce Wallet in 2020. While this innovation is being replicated by competitors, we expect it will create a promising new high-margin revenue stream for Ceridian that leverages the firms exposure to millions of employees and their earned wages. To remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market, Ceridian will need to maintain high levels of investment in product development and innovation, in our view. Dayforces functionality including continuous payroll calculation has provided a point of differentiation historically, but rivals are rapidly replicating these innovations, diminishing the competitive edge. Ceridian has made a tactical shift to target larger businesses and move further upmarket into the large enterprise and global space. While this drives higher revenue per client and exposes the company to a larger pool of client funds, we expect fierce competitive pressures and powerful clients will lead to increased pricing pressure, limiting margin upside potential over the long run. ","Ceridian has garnered a narrow economic moat underpinned by high customer switching costs. We think it also benefits from intangible brand assets based on a growing record of performance supporting the companys ability to take market share. While dominant incumbent provider ADP has invested heavily over the past decade to remain competitive on functionality, nascent providers like Ceridian have been able to capitalize on the leaders shortfalls and capture share through the appeal of a unified, user-friendly platform. Over the five years to fiscal 2022, Ceridians flagship product Dayforces client base grew at an 15% CAGR to about 6,000 clients, relative to an estimated mid-single-digit growth for ADPs midsize and enterprise client base over a comparable period. While Ceridians returns on invested capital including goodwill have fallen short of our estimated weighted average cost of capital to date (based on available data since the fiscal 2018 initial public offering), we view the companys robust cloud revenue retention in the mid- to high-90s as supportive of a narrow moat. We expect Ceridian will achieve positive economic profits by fiscal 2024, supported by greater operating leverage, as it continues to increase scale and upsell high-margin modules to new and existing clients. Ceridian holds a minority but fast-growing share of the North America payroll and HCM markets and is rapidly expanding its global footprint through organic and acquisitive investment. Approximately 70% of group revenue is derived from clients headquartered in the United States, with the remainder primarily derived from Canada-based clients. While the Dayforce platform services a broad range of business sizes, it is primarily geared to enterprise clients with the average client size around 1,000 employees over the four years to fiscal 2021. The company reports an estimated 4% market share across its 100- to 100,000-employee target market in North America and less than 1% share globally. On a more granular basis, we estimate Ceridian has a market share of about 2% of the 50- to 999-employee midsize market in the U.S. This compares with ADPs and Paychexs midsize market shares of about 30% and 14%, respectively. For the 1,000-plus employee enterprise market, we estimate Ceridian has a low-double-digit market share in the U.S., compared with about 23% for ADP. In Canada, we estimate Ceridians Powerpay platform has about a 3% share in the highly fragmented small-business market. We expect most future client growth to come from taking share in the enterprise market, including further global expansion of the Dayforce platform. This will result in mid- to high-single-digit group revenue per client growth, offset by flat client size growth and minimal price increases for small-business customers. Dayforce offers a range of payroll and HCM solutions via its unified, cloud-based platform supported by a single database. This platform infrastructure is scalable, can be efficiently maintained and modified, and supports a streamlined user experience, reducing the need for integrations with separate platforms or databases. Dayforces infrastructure supports real-time continuous payroll calculation and, as a natural extension, on-demand pay. Leveraging this functionality, Ceridian introduced Dayforce Wallet in 2020, which allows clients employees to load their net earned wages on demand to a prepaid Mastercard, generating interchange fee revenue for Ceridian when purchases are made. This product is free for employees to use and has been well received to date, with mature clients benefiting from lower employee attrition and shorter recruitment cycles attributed to a better employee experience offering. Like its payroll and HCM peers, Ceridian benefits from high customer switching costs. Payroll and HCM software is typically deeply embedded in a business operations, making it a costly and time-intensive process to switch providers. Alongside monetary costs, a business could face operational disruptions and inefficiencies, including having to train employees on the new system and integrate the new solution with other software and risk losing data. As of 2022, Ceridian's flagship Dayforce platform boasted retention of 97.1%. Assuming minimal annual price increases, this implies an average cloud platform clients life span of at least 20 years. While about 88% of group revenue was derived from cloud products in fiscal 2022, we assume the remaining revenue from legacy Bureau solutions would marginally dampen the group revenue retention rate. We expect Ceridian to continue to invest in software development and delivering high-grade user experiences to maintain high retention rates overall. Maintaining high customer retention rates allows Ceridian to earn a steady stream of recurring revenue at a low marginal cost. We think Ceridians growing reputation for delivering reliable and compliant solutions over the past decade is supporting its ability to win market share, including in international markets. Payroll is a highly sensitive, complex, and mission-critical operation for all businesses that place a high value on reliability, accuracy, compliance, and data security. The potential ramifications for a business that fails to make payroll on time or accurately, is noncompliant with applicable laws, or breaches data security can be severe. We believe legacy providers have stronger brand assets by virtue of their longer operating histories and larger scale, but Ceridian has an advantage over newer entrants that lack a record of performance. ","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Ceridian. While the company has diversified its revenue across payroll and HCM solutions, it remains exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets. Ceridian typically earns revenue on a per employee per month basis, exposing it to fluctuations in employment levels. Our rating is also influenced by upside uncertainty, as we expect Ceridian to benefit from industry tailwinds during an economic boom, including higher payroll per client, greater demand for solutions to recruit, retain, and manage employees, and higher yields on client funds. Ceridians environmental, social, and governance risk is low. Ceridian handles high volumes of sensitive, personally identifiable information for its customers and their employees, exposing the company to data privacy and security risk; however, we view this risk as low and immaterial to our rating. If a breaching of data security or data privacy laws were to occur, Ceridian would be exposed to regulatory fines, civil lawsuits, and/or reputational damage. But Ceridian has robust data privacy and security measures in place, including board and executive risk management oversight, a dedicated cybersecurity committee and data privacy team, and external auditing of controls and industry-standard practices. The company is subject to a consent order imposed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission following a cyberattack on a discontinued payroll application in 2009. To comply with this order, Ceridian must maintain a robust cybersecurity program with regular external audits until 2031. We expect Ceridian will remain compliant with this order and simultaneously uphold robust controls to mitigate data privacy and security risk. While Ceridian has had no major data privacy or security breaches since, there is scope for further improvement, including adopting binding corporate rules aligned with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation. ","We assign Ceridian a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Ceridians balance sheet is sound. The company operates a capital-light business model with strong free cash flow generation potential. Ceridian has higher leverage than peers, but we expect it will achieve a net cash position by fiscal 2026 as earnings improve. The incurred debt has been used to fund business growth, including through organic and acquisitive investments, which we expect will bear fruit in the coming years. As earnings improve, we expect Ceridian could increase leverage to support further investment in internally generated software, or for bolt-on acquisitions to expand its global scale. Given the uncertainty around timing and pricing, we do not explicitly forecast future acquisitions. In the absence of attractive acquisition targets or internal investment opportunities, we would expect Ceridian to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. We assess Ceridians investment efficacy as fair. Following the transformative 2012 acquisition of Dayforce, Ceridian pivoted away from its legacy Bureau offerings to become a fast-growing cloud HCM provider. To integrate the acquisition, the company embarked on a multiyear program to migrate existing clients on legacy solutions to Dayforce, with about 80% of group revenue derived from that platform in 2022. While we view the transition to a cloud offering as prudent and expect the company to realize future economic profits, Ceridians weak historical returns on invested capital suggest the company probably overpaid for this acquisition, hampering our view of its investment efficacy. Since acquiring Dayforce, Ceridian has built out the platforms functionality by developing a broad set of HCM modules and expanding into adjacent markets through Dayforce Wallet. The company has had success in driving adoption of these modules with about 39% of new clients adopting the full suite and 25% of annual revenue derived from upselling back to the existing client base as of fiscal 2022. This model has driven a steady increase in per employee per month revenue, and we expect increased client stickiness as the software becomes further entrenched in clients and their employees day-to-day operations. To support its global expansion strategy, Ceridian has made several bolt-on acquisitions in recent years of established regional payroll and HCM providers with local expertise and networks, but which operate legacy infrastructure. Ceridians acquisition strategy is to establish a presence is new markets and migrate the acquired providers clients to the Dayforce platform over a multiyear horizon while upselling modules and increasing per employee per month revenue. We anticipate Ceridian will be able to migrate acquired clients to its Dayforce platform, continue to increase scale, and realize value from these acquisitions. However, execution risk remains, including potential client attrition from forced migrations and increased expenditure on integrating the acquisitions. Ceridians shareholder distributions are appropriate. The company does not pay shareholder dividends or undertake regular share repurchases, which we view as prudent as it continues to increase scale, expand its portfolio of modules to drive higher revenue per client, and take market share. We expect the company will refrain from paying dividends or undertaking share repurchases for the foreseeable future and will reinvest free cash flow in organic and acquisitive investments to expand the business.","Ceridian HCM provides payroll and human capital management solutions targeting clients with 100-100,000 employees. Following the 2012 acquisition of Dayforce, Ceridian pivoted away from its legacy on-premises Bureau business to become a cloud HCM provider. As of fiscal 2022, about 80% of group revenue was derived from the flagship Dayforce platform geared toward enterprise clients. The remaining revenue is about evenly split between cloud platform Powerpay, targeting small businesses in Canada, and legacy Bureau products. ","Ceridian is in a reasonable financial position. At the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023, Ceridian had a net debt position of about $730 million and reported about $1.2 billion of long-term debt. The company has access to a secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan. Under these agreements, Ceridian is subject to certain operating and financial covenants, including restrictions on incurring further debt and issuing distributions, and must not exceed specific gearing ratios. While we expect Ceridian to remain compliant with debt covenants and meet interest payments on outstanding debt, we caution investors that the firm faces heightened risk in the event of a severe economic downturn or increased volatility in employment markets. Ceridians net debt balance is materially higher than payroll peers that boast net cash or low leverage positions, which elevates solvency concerns amid uncertain economic conditions. Nevertheless, we expect Ceridian to deleverage the balance sheet as profitability improves, and for the firm to reach a reach a net cash position by fiscal 2026. While Ceridian operates a capital-light business model with strong free cash flow generation potential, we expect it will continue to not pay dividends or undertake share repurchases for the foreseeable future and instead invest excess cash in growth through organic and acquisitive investments, and to repay outstanding debt obligations.

24/11/2023,Applied Materials Is a Dominant WFE Provider With a Wide Moat,Applied Materials Inc,AMAT,3,17/11/2023,William Kerwin,149.48,USD,23/11/2023,152.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,17/11/2023,"We maintain our $152 fair value estimate for shares of wide-moat Applied Materials after the firm reported good fiscal fourth-quarter results and guidance largely met our expectations. Applied continues to enjoy strong demand for lagging-edge chip equipment, particularly out of China. Management is calling for this demand to moderate through fiscal 2024, but to be offset by recovering demand in advanced logic and memory chips. Shares dropped roughly 7% afterhours, which we attribute to a Reuters report about a potential investigation into Applied by the U.S. Justice Department concerning shipments to SMIC, the largest Chinese foundry. Without corroboration or further detail, we arent adjusting our forecasts for the firm based on the lone report. We continue to like Applieds strong position in front-end chip equipment, built on enormous investment and sticky solutions. We see shares as fairly valued. Applieds October quarter sales rose 5% sequentially and were flat year over year at $6.7 billion. Logic and foundry customers continued to make up a heightened portion of Applieds business against weaker memory markets. Nevertheless, were encouraged by recovering DRAM chip demand, buoyed by a surge in China DRAM orders. Applieds lagging-edge customers have delivered torrid demand over the past two years, more than offsetting more modest orders in leading-edge logic. Management expects this dynamic to reverse as it progresses through fiscal 2024. Overall, we continue to appreciate Applieds ability to outperform both the chip and wafer fabrication equipment markets by taking share with strong solutions. Margins were healthy in the quarter, supported by higher volumes sequentially. Sequentially, non-GAAP gross margin rose 90 basis points to 47.3%, and non-GAAP operating margin rose 120 basis points to 29.5%. We expect margins to rise steadily over the next couple of years behind rising volumes and for gross margins to approach managements target of 48.5%.","Applied Materials is the largest WFE provider in the world, with the broadest portfolio and the largest R&D budget of its peers. We expect Applied Materials to benefit from drivers of chip complexity like gate all-around transistors and advanced packaging. Applied Materials has strong profit margins and cash flow, and sends most of its cash flow back to shareholders.",We consider Applied Materials to be a generalist in WFE and competes with more specialized competitors like Lam Research and KLA that could outcompete the firm in their respective markets. Applied Materials faces cyclicality in the semiconductor market that can lead to years with lower sales and margin compression. Applied Materials faces risk from geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China that may further inhibit its ability to ship to Chinese chipmakers.,17/11/2023,"Applied Materials is the largest supplier in the world of wafer fabrication equipment for semiconductors. It holds the broadest portfolio, in our view, which we think should enable it to maintain its leading market share. In our view, Applied Materials' breadth in chip manufacturing gives it stickier inroads to customers by selling integrated solutions across technologies. We expect Applied Materials to grow at a mid-single-digit pace over the course of market cycles as it benefits from trends toward more-complex chips into the long term, including gate all-around transistors, advanced packaging, and artificial intelligence. We assign a wide economic moat rating to Applied Materials, stemming from immense capabilities in cutting-edge chip manufacturing and steep switching costs for customers. Applied Materials is the only WFE provider to compete meaningfully in the market segments of etch, deposition, and process control, going toe-to-toe with more-specialized competitors like Lam Research and KLA. We believe Applied Materials' market-leading research and development budget, totaling more than $3 billion annually, generates substantial intangible assets for the firm and fuels its ability to win and maintain customers across these three distinct segments, in part with its integrated solutions. We also see the complexity of Applied Materials' equipment and its embedded services business as sticky. In our view, the firms competitive advantage enables it to earn strong profit margins and robust cash flow.  We expect Applied Materials' results to be prone to semiconductor market cyclicality, but we believe it will achieve growth over the long term. The firms sales are a function of global chip volumes and overall chip complexity, and while we see cyclicality in the former, we see durable growth for the latter. We monitor for geopolitical risk affecting Applied Materials via export restrictions applied between the U.S. and China, but we see these controls primarily having an impact on lithography equipment and chip designers thus far. Finally, we like Applied Materials' significant shareholder returns funded with its heady cash flow.","We assign Applied Materials a wide economic moat, on the basis of intangible assets and switching costs. Applied Materials' proficiency in wafer fabrication equipment results from topnotch design expertise, in our view, and we think its embedded services business and long-term customer roadmaps are sticky. We also believe the sheer amount of investment required to remain at the forefront of leading chip development, particularly across so many subsections of the market, creates an immense barrier to entry to all but the largest and best-capitalized chip equipment manufacturers. We expect Applied Materials to earn returns on invested capital well above its cost of capital, more likely than not, for the next 20 years.We see Applied Materials holding the most comprehensive portfolio of equipment for semiconductor manufacturing in the world. Applied Materials product lines run the gamut of chip manufacturing, able to serve logic and memory chipmakers alike with cutting-edge equipment, and offerings in nearly every category that span the cost and capability spectrum. While many other WFE peers occupy one or two corners of the market (like Lam with etch and deposition and KLA with process control,) Applied Materials plays in them all in a meaningful way. The only exception is lithography, where ASML has a vise grip. Deposition makes up roughly a quarter of the total WFE market, and Applied Materials' share above 40% more than doubles that of its nearest competitor. In etch and process control, Applied Magterials holds the third- and second-place share, respectively, and is the only player above 10% share in all three of these markets. Applied Materials also dominates smaller subsections of WFE, such as thermal processing, and doping (the intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties). To us, these strong share positions are the result of unmatched portfolio breadth and depth, fed by a market-leading $3 billion research and development budget per year. This huge budget dwarfs all but the largest of WFE competitors, and enables Applied Materials to continue building its immense base of intangible assets. The strength of Applied Materials' offerings helps it generate healthy non-GAAP gross margins in the mid to high 40% range.Applied Materials' broad and deep portfolio helps it win customers, and we see it embedding customers once installed. Chipmaking is extremely complicated and precise. Applied Materials' equipment is responsible for creating transistors more than one thousand times smaller than a human hair and packing trillions of them into a 12-inch diameter wafer, with minimal defects. Customers demand the ability to produce millions of these wafers a month. Development and manufacturing to this level of precision gets calibrated to specific customer product lines, and chipmakers build workflows around their equipment with the singular goal of efficient production. Applied Materials sends on-site service engineers to customer fabs to operate as an extension of the chipmakers engineering team. These service engineers help to calibrate equipment during R&D, tweak and fix bugs during production, and work with chipmakers on meeting manufacturing requirements. They also work on equipment upgrades or recalibration to repurpose equipment. The high complexity of WFE machines and the integration of Applied Materials' service engineers make it hard to replace, in our view. Beyond the cost of purchasing new equipment (to the tune of $1 million or more per machine), chipmakers would need to redesign manufacturing workflows and learn wholesale new hardware and software interfaces, as well as restart knowledge sharing with new services engineers. Applied Materials' equipment can last in the field for multiple decades, which generates deep connections with customer engineering teams and augments this stickiness. Applied Materials' deep customer relationships also entail forward-looking project roadmaps up to 10 years out, giving the firm a leg up in winning new placements as it can target new machines to exact customer requirements. Finally, with its broadest-in-class portfolio, Applied Materials increasingly sells integrated solutions to customers, sometimes combining seven different process steps and chambers in one unified piece of equipment. This can offer better performance, cost, and development time to chipmakers, and also makes Applied Materials' equipment even stickier, in our view.The combination of Applied Materials' large portfolio, sticky customer relationships, and immense ongoing investment gives us confidence in the durability of its competitive position and healthy profitability. We believe this will allow it to continue earning strong economic profits, more likely than not, for the next 20 years and results in a wide economic moat.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Applied Materials. Applied Materials is prone to cyclicality in the semiconductor industry, with times of oversupply and lower capital expenditures followed by times of strong demand and more manufacturing buildouts. Applied Materials' results can fluctuate with semiconductor end demand, but we retain our belief that it can grow over the course of cycles into the long term. Applied Materials also faces risk from geopolitical uncertainty, primarily between the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has levied export restrictions on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which limits Applied Materials' ability to ship to Chinese chipmakers. This impact is already digested, and Applied Materials is largely able to compensate with demand elsewhere in the world, in our view. Still, there is risk that restrictions ramp up further and could be a sales headwind for the firm.We see risk for Applied Materials in its competitors, which are often more specialized than Applied. Lam Research is concentrated in etch and deposition, while KLA is concentrated in process control. Applied Materials faces risk from battling on two fronts here, and if it is not able to adequately invest, it could find itself losing out to these strong competitors. Applied Materials also bears risk from a concentrated customer base. If it a relationship with a large manufacturer like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel were to sour, its competitive position could worsen.Finally, we foresee little environmental, social, and governance risk for Applied Materials. Its primary risk in this domain would be losing human capital to other WFE firms. If Applied Materials isnt able to maintain its critical engineers, it could start to see its intangible assets erode.","We assign Applied Materials an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, driven by a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and good shareholder returns.Applied Materials' balance sheet is strong, in our view, with a net cash position and long-dated debt maturities. It also generates good free cash flow, most of which it sends back to shareholders. Applied Materials has increased its dividend every year since 2018, and targets sending more than 80% of free cash flow back to shareholders, inclusive of buybacks. It usually well exceeds this target.We think Applied Materials' investments in the business have been exceptional. In our view, the firm rightly prioritizes R&D investments for organic growth in a consolidated industry. It outspends every competitor on R&D, and we credit its strong organic investment for share gains in the WFE market over the past five years. We see this investment creating its wide economic moat. The WFE market is quite consolidated, with the top five suppliers (including Applied Materials) making up over 70% of total revenue. We dont foresee sizable deals between these large players given concerns of anticompetition. A good example is the failed Applied Materials-Tokyo Electron merger of 2015. Still, Applied Materials makes occasional small bolt-on deals to reinforce its software capabilities or add depth in a particular chemical process.","Applied Materials is the largest semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment, or WFE, manufacturer in the world. Applied Materials has a broad portfolio spanning nearly every corner of the WFE ecosystem. Specifically, Applied Materials holds a market share leadership position in deposition, which entails the layering of new materials on semiconductor wafers. It is more exposed to general-purpose logic chips made at integrated device manufacturers and foundries. It counts the largest chipmakers in the world as customers, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.","We expect Applied Materials to focus on generating strong cash flow while prioritizing research and development investment. We also expect it to remain moderately leveraged. As of October 2023, Applied Materials held a net cash position, with $6.9 billion in cash and liquid investments compared with $5.6 billion in total debt. We like Applied Materials' strong balance sheet, which is supported by long-dated debt, the majority of which doesnt come due until after 2030. Applied Materials also has a $1.5 billion revolver it could tap into if needed. Applied Materials' strong balance sheet is strengthened by robust cash flow. Over the past five fiscal years, Applied Materials has averaged $4.6 billion in annual free cash flow, and we expect this number to jump over our five-year forecast to more than $7 billion as its volume grows. Both of these are close to 100% conversion of Applied Materials' net income.",AMAT,Technology,126810185728.0,NMS,4929366.0,USD,149.47999572753906,True,0,142.3771084056259,173.09113603756666,1
24/11/2023,CSR Earnings: Strong Backlog Shielding Sales From Housing Construction Slowdown ,CSR Ltd,CSR,3,02/11/2023,Brian Han,5.86,AUD,24/11/2023,5.8,Medium,,Standard,,02/11/2023,"We raise our fair value estimate for no-moat CSR by 5% to AUD 5.80 per share, with shares screening roughly fairly valued. Despite a challenging housing construction backdrop, CSRs building products business posted sales of AUD 1.009 billion in the first half of fiscal 2024, 11% above the previous corresponding period, or pcp. First-half building product EBIT reached a record AUD 165 million, up 18% year on year. Previously, we had factored in material volume declines for building products in fiscal 2024, reflecting the ongoing deterioration in detached dwelling approvals. But a strong backlog and an out-of-cycle price increase in the second half of fiscal 2023 have seen CSRs sales decouple from the broader economic environment. We revise our near-term outlook accordingly. With CSRs building products segment looking much more resilient than originally anticipated, we now expect fiscal 2024 group sales to post a modest 1% fall on fiscal 2023, compared with a previous forecast of a sharp 13% decline. Although industry approvals for detached dwellings, which account for over half of building products revenue, are down 15% in the six months to September 2023 compared with the pcp, CSRs pipeline is 50% above historical averages. This is set to drive activity well into calendar 2024, insulating CSR from the cyclical slowdown. Multiresidential construction, 17% of segment sales, also has a healthy pipeline of around two to three years of work. And approvals for nonresidential construction, 23% of sales, are at record levels, with particular strength in schools and health facilities. Resilient volumes, combined with the out-of-cycle price increase, saw the operating margin for building products improve to 16.3% from 15.3% in the pcp, despite input cost pressures. We are now projecting a full-year building products EBIT margin of 14.9%, a 100-basis-point upgrade on our previous forecast and flat on fiscal 2023.","Capacity reductions in China and strong demand for aluminum could result in more favorable aluminum prices for a prolonged duration. Further reduction in brick capacity by competitors leads to improved pricing power and increased profitability relative to prior housing cycles. CSRs building products gains market share as its products become more preferred for insulation, plasterboard and concrete blocks given their quality or ease to install. ","Higher interest rates persist, leading to a protracted downturn in new housing construction.  Structurally higher east coast energy prices and depressed aluminum prices lead to maintained depressed margins in the aluminum business.  The structural decline in brick use is hastened by labour shortages, thereby reducing demand relative to non-brick building product alternatives such a fibre cement which CSR has a limited exposure to. ",02/11/2023,"CSR is one of Australias leading building materials companies, producing bricks, plasterboard, insulation, fibre cement, and aerated autoclaved concrete. CSR manufactures and distributes widely recognized building product brands such as Gyprock plasterboard, PGH bricks, Monier roof tiles, Bradford insulation, and Hebel panels. CSR also holds a 25% effective interest in the Tomago aluminum smelter, with joint venture partners Rio Tinto Alcan and Hydro Aluminium. Property development of surplus and excess land is also a key valuation driver, with a property portfolio valued at over AUD 1.5 billion. CSRs strategy targets through the cycle earnings growth and positive returns on capital alongside investment in incremental capacity, optimization (product rationalization, increased penetration of higher-margin products, greater energy efficiency), operational efficiency (including supply chain), and by increasing its exposure to the structural trend toward increased use of lightweight or labor efficient building products and systems with a low relative installation costs versus traditional building products. CSR is also targeting market share gains by growing its product penetration into the medium and high-density end residential construction markets.  Were encouraged by CSRs stated position that it is not the natural owner of the Tomago aluminum smelter, given the asset lacks an economic competitive advantage, plotting at the higher end of the global aluminum cost curve. While a divestment would need to be co-ordinated with its joint venture partners, given pre-emptive rights allow the JV partners to acquire each others interests at a discount to any market value, we would view a divestment positively given the challenging structural outlook for east coast electricity prices, which are likely to impair returns over the long run, unless global aluminum prices materially rise above our midcycle price forecast of USD 2700 per metric ton.  ","We do not assign a moat to CSR. We see little in the way of intellectual property or proprietary manufacturing among the variety of branded building products or building systems which would allow consistent, through-the-cycle pricing power or durable cost advantage to facilitate excess economic returns. We observe a variety of readily available substitutes for CSRs manufactured and distributed building products and building systems with limited product differentiation. For example, CSR sells a series of branded lightweight building products, such as insulation and plasterboard, however these products are commoditized and naturally subject to import competition from several Asian manufacturers. Asian building product manufacturers operate at greater scale and have access to cheaper labor which position them favorably against Australian manufacturers such as CSR. Heavier building products of bricks, pavers, and roof tiles have a low value/mass ratio and have demonstrate limited pricing power through the cycle due to their commoditised nature. These products also contend with the alternatives of concrete block, fibre cement, concrete panels, and coated steel, which are a threat to pricing power and CSRs existing market share in heavy building products. Among domestic manufactures of heavier building products, the energy cost structure in the form of gas is the primary competitive differentiator. Favourable wholesale long-term gas supply contracts, in general, underpin a meaningful portion of any manufacturers cost advantage. However, we do not see a wholesale gas contract as inaccessible to competitors and legacy wholesale contracts with favourable pricing eventually reset toward market prices. The capital development costs for brick manufacturing capacity are also not prohibitive. CSRs largest division is building products. CSRs gyprock plasterboard business alone accounts for around 40% of the segments revenue. We estimate CSRs gyprock plasterboard business operates with a 40% market share with the remaining market participants being Etex (Siniat and Kanuf brands) with 50% market share and BCG with 10% market share. While BCG operates primarily on the west coast, Etex and CSR form a duopoly on the east coast of Australia. Despite both operate differentiated brands, we do not believe either company commands brand equity to maintain a pricing premium over the long run. Furthermore, we do not believe CSR or Etex have a manufacturing costs advantage. The key input of gypsum is sourced from the Lake MacDonnell mine in South Australia. Western Australia is the only other significant gypsum producer, with most of the states output being exported to Southeast Asian markets. In South Australia, the Lake MacDonnell mine operates as a joint venture (Gypsum Resources Australia) owned by Etex and CSR. With the two market leaders sourcing the majority of their gypsum from the same resource, very similar manufacturing costs exists for both market leaders eliminating any potential maintained cost advantage relative to each other. CSRs PGH bricks operates as the second-largest clay brick producer in Australia with capacity of 600 million standard brick equivalents. This accounts for about 40% of industry capacity. The Australian brick industry operates as a duopoly with Brickworks (Austral Bricks) as CSRs main competitor. While the duopoly in bricks facilitates a more rational pricing environment, the industry faces the trend of declining brick use. Competing materials of concrete masonry, concrete panels, fibre cement, and aerated concrete have taken market share as the preferred exterior materials in new residential construction. Further accelerating this structural decline in brick use is the reduced share of detached housing in new residential construction in favour of apartments. This has largely accounted for reduced use of bricks in the last two decades according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Finally increasing labour costs and a shortage of brick layers raises the installed cost of bricks relative to competing materials which are lighter weight and relatively easier to install. Given these industry dynamics, we expect underlying brick demand to be constrained and observe limited competitive advantages in bricks given the ease of product substitution.CSRs Cemintel fibre cement operates with a lack of a discernible and durable competitive advantage as the second-largest domestic fibre cement manufacturer measured by installed production capacity. Market leader James Hardie operates with both an intangible asset and cost advantage underpinned by its leading brand and larger scale manufacturing capacity. CSRs Hebel aerated autoclaved concrete is the dominant domestic manufacturer of lightweight concrete block which has experienced rapid volume growth. CSRs Hebel demonstrates strong market growth with the firm spending AUD 75 million in 2019 to doubling production capacity to 980 cubic metres. Despite this, the product is not a significant contributor to group earnings. CSRs holds an 25% effective interest in the 590,000 metric tons per year aluminum smelter located in Tomago, NSW. The Tomago smelter accounts under 1% of global aluminum production. The smelter is over 40 years old, with its asset value having been largely depreciated. Over 90% of the output at Tomago is exported into the Asia-Pacific. Currently, the smelter operates with a electricity contract expiring in 2028. Without certainty over its power contract post 2028, in structurally challenged, capacity constrained electricity market on the east coast of Australia, we see limited scope for Tomago to operate with a cost advantage. We see the risk of Tomagos position on the global cost curve to worsen. Relative to competing international aluminum smelters, the Tomago smelter operates with reduce scale, and a strong likelihood of higher of cost electricity given that competing scale smelters are co-located to low-cost renewable energy sources such as hydroelectricity. CSRs property business continues to be a healthy contributor, having generated more than AUD 220 million in cumulative EBIT since 2016. We expect the business to be an ongoing contributor to earnings with value being underpinned by property development and a land bank of 50 properties with an estimated value of over AUD 1.5 billion. Nevertheless, we do not view the business as having a strong competitive advantage as we do not view land acquired at historical market prices and the activity of large scale, staged property development as having a maintainable competitive advantage.","We assign CSR a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, given the cyclical nature of the firms end market exposure to new residential construction activity. CSRs aluminum smelter is also exposed to volatile aluminum prices where pricing is determined by global economic growth and capacity. With aluminum contracts priced in U.S. dollars, there is further uncertainty driven by foreign exchange risk. However, Tomago hedges near-term prices to underpin the smelters ability to meets operating expenses. Portions of the building products business, in particular bricks and plasterboard operate with a high-fixed-cost base indicative of the segments earnings uncertainty. While we deem ESG risks associated with CSR's building products portfolio as relatively well managed, CSR's effective 25% equity stake in the Tomago aluminum smelter has meaningful associated carbon risk due to its heavy consumption of coal-based electricity. Structural increases in east coast electricity prices alongside increased climate change action have the potential to materially impair the returns for the Tomago smelter.","We rate CSRs Capital Allocation as Standard. Our through cycle capital allocation rating is the result of generally prudent decisions offset by certain large negative decisions like the acquisition and subsequent investments in domestic float glass capacity (Viridian) in 2007, which was then restructured, written down, and finally sold in 2018. Our standard assessment is underpinned by CSRs demonstrating healthy returns in capital employed, several initiatives which have facilitated capital-efficient growth, a relatively conservative balance sheet over the cycle and appropriately timed capital management initiatives of dividends and share buybacks. CSRs involvement with Tomago appears passive in nature given its minority shareholding and lack of direct operational involvement.Management is focussed on growing the building products segment, to which it is allocating capital for organic and acquisitive growth, is improving efficiency, as well as targeting greater product penetration into the medium and high-density residential end markets. Capital has also been allocated toward products which demonstrate increased installation efficiency benefitting homebuilders. Examples of CSRs positive capital allocation initiatives include the purchase of Borals brick assets in 2016, the acquisition of AFS Products for its Logicwall and Rediwall Systems in 2014, increased capacity investments in aerated concrete capacity, the rationalisation of its brick capacity to generate greater operating efficiency and an increased focus on property development. ","CSR is one of Australias leading building materials companies; it produces plasterboard, bricks, roof tiles, insulation, glass, fibre cement, and aerated autoclaved concrete. Founded as Colonial Sugar Refining in 1855, CSR started producing building materials in 1942 and manufactures recognisee brands like gyprock plasterboard. CSR sold its sugar assets in 2010 to focus primarily on building products and property development. CSR has a 25% effective interest in the Tomago aluminum smelter.","CSR generally has a conservative balance sheet either with low levels of gearing or being net cash. At the end of fiscal 2023, CSR operated with a net cash position of AUD 132 million (excluding lease liabilities) or a net debt position of AUD 32 million (including lease liabilities). We see this balance sheet positioning as prudent given the firm's exposure to a softening residential housing market in Australia. Substantial balance sheet flexibility remains in place for CSR and we expect healthy operating cash generation from the building products business. We forecast CSR to maintain a net cash position through the forecast period, subject to acquisitions and capital management initiatives.

24/11/2023,Near-Term Challenges for LKQ Do Not Change Our Long-Term Thesis,LKQ Corp,LKQ,3,26/10/2023,Dawit Woldemariam,45.74,USD,23/11/2023,49.0,Medium,Narrow,Standard,B,26/10/2023,"LKQ reported mixed third-quarter results due to profitability challenges. EBITDA margins were down across all segments. In North America, EBITDA margin contracted 240 basis points. The inclusion of Uni-Selects financials had a 180-basis-point negative impact, since the acquired firm's products have lower margins than LKQs North American products. In Europe, EBITDA margin was down 200 basis points due to a nonrecurring tax charge (70 basis points), labor strike in Germany (40 basis points), and growing customer price sensitivity (90 basis points). Profitability was also challenged in LKQs specialty and self-service segments. EBITDA margin in the specialty business was down 200 basis points, while self-service declined 300 basis points. In specialty, management called out increased price competition (competitors improving inventory levels) and unfavorable sales mix. For self-service, lower precious metals pricing coupled with elevated car costs pressured margin. But despite near-term headwinds, we remain confident in LKQs long-term prospects. Following the earnings update, we've raised our fair value estimate to $49 per share from $46.50. We attribute over 4 percentage points of the fair value estimate increase to the time value of money since our last update, with the balance coming from upward adjustments to our near-term forecast, along with slight increases to our long-term sales and margin expectations. Overall, repair demand remains solid, which we think will drive demand for LKQs aftermarket parts. Vehicle miles driven has rebounded to prepandemic levels. With more drivers on the road, we think theres an increased probability of vehicle accidents, which in turn create repair demand. The growth of advanced driver-assistance systems could slow the rate of accidents, but we think adoption will be gradual. Notably, some vehicle models give drivers the ability to turn off ADAS.","Growth in miles driven increases the wear and tear on vehicles, requiring more maintenance and repair work to keep them on the road, benefiting LKQ. LKQs collision business could see rising demand from increasing auto claims as more drivers return to the road following the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing adoption of hybrid vehicles presents new revenue opportunities for LKQ, such as new battery-related parts, in addition to its ICE-related parts.","Increasing adoption of ADAS technology could lead to a reduction in the number of auto accidents, pressuring LKQs collision business. The companys 1 LKQ Europe initiative could face challenges in rationalizing its product portfolio and improving its procurement systems. Bottlenecks in the ocean freight industry could extend the average time it takes for LKQs imported aftermarket parts to reach its operating regions, making it difficult for the firm to maintain its high order fulfillment rates.",26/10/2023,"LKQ is the top alternative vehicle-parts provider to repair shops in North America and Europe. We believe the company benefits from scale-driven cost advantages in its business. Customers value LKQs consistent parts availability across a wide range of products and quick delivery. LKQ helps customers complete repairs faster, improving productivity. We think the companys strong distribution network will support its ability to keep order fulfillment rates high in both aftermarket and salvage products.  The companys strategy focuses on being a one-stop shop for repair professionals, ranging from salvage products to aftermarket and remanufactured parts. LKQs parts are a strong alternative to original equipment manufacturers parts, exhibiting high quality in comparison. While insurance companies arent usually direct customers, they do have sway over which parts are used in vehicle repairs. LKQs alternative parts allows insurance companies to reduce their cost base while also reducing the cycle time for repairs. Historically, the company has used acquisitions to build up its capabilities and footprint, but that has changed over the past few years. LKQ has shifted its focus to integrating its businesses and improving its cost structure, and we believe it will aim to make smaller tuck-in acquisitions as opposed to larger deals.  We think LKQ is well positioned to compete as electric vehicle adoption increases. The shift to EVs will present new revenue opportunities for the company, in our view. In both hybrid and full-electric vehicles, new parts will be needed to keep vehicles on the road. For example, we expect to see increased demand for battery-related parts and a need for remanufactured or refurbished batteries.  LKQ has exposure to end markets with attractive tailwinds. We think demand for vehicle repair work will be strong in the near term, largely due to the high average age of vehicles.","Over the past two decades, LKQ has evolved from an auto salvage business to a comprehensive alternative parts provider, which extends to aftermarket, remanufactured, and refurbished auto parts. As the largest player in the highly fragmented auto-parts industry, LKQ benefits primarily from scale-driven cost advantages over smaller competitors, in our view. LKQ is the largest auto-parts distributor in North America and Europe. We believe smaller local and regional competitors will struggle to win market share in both regions, given LKQs strong distribution network, efficient inventory management, and extensive customer service capabilities. We award LKQ a narrow economic moat rating because we expect its competitive positioning will allow it to generate excess returns over the next decade. We think LKQs high fulfillment rates are driven by its product breadth and consistent product availability. LKQs primary customers are collision and mechanical vehicle repair shops, which need auto parts on demand. These customers value LKQs ability to maintain optimal inventory levels for a wide range of products. Repair shops usually work under tight time constraints, so finding the desired part when they need it is important to them. We estimate LKQs order fulfillment rates for aftermarket products are approximately 95% compared with about 65% for its competitors. In addition, we estimate fulfillment rates for salvage parts are about 75% for LKQ versus roughly 25% for competitors. In our view, this shows that LKQs product breadth and extensive customer service capabilities are unmatched by peers. We also believe LKQ benefits from cost advantages stemming from global product sourcing and scalable distribution networks. In the aftermarket vertical, LKQ globally sources aftermarket parts from independent manufacturers in Taiwan in addition to the United States. This dynamic helps the company earn higher gross profit margins in comparison with smaller peers. Additionally, we think LKQs distribution network is a differentiator. The company operates national distribution centers that help stock branches with popular parts. The distribution network is also flexible enough to shift inventory between LKQs facilities to meet demand, utilizing the companys own fleet of trucks. We believe this allows LKQ to cost-effectively serve its customer base, which requires high product availability. We think LKQs well-developed salvage procurement system drives its ability to keep costs low. The company sources its recycled vehicles from car auctions. LKQs bidders utilize internally developed software to cross-check current inventory levels and average selling prices to determine an optimal bid for vehicles. This prevents the company from overspending on vehicles, driving higher profitability compared with smaller peers. After recycled vehicles are bought at auction, LKQ breaks them down into individual parts, which are then sold to vehicle repair shops. Each year, we estimate LKQ acquires over 300,000 vehicles for its salvage business. We believe LKQs procurement process is the best in the industry. The company efficiently catalogs parts and utilizes artificial intelligence to improve its vehicle assessment capabilities. AI technology allows LKQ to catch damage to vehicles that its bidding specialists fail to see.LKQ has historically been very acquisitive, but that changed in 2019. The management teams roll-up strategy helped LKQ venture into new product verticals and expand its geographical footprint. LKQ moved into selling customers aftermarket, remanufactured, and refurbished auto parts in addition to its salvage products. By expanding its product offering, LKQ has become a one-stop shop for customers. The company has also increased its footprint globally. During its early days, LKQ was solely a North American business, but today it also operates in Europe. The companys European operations commenced in 2011 and have grown significantly since. Currently, the region generates nearly $6 billion in annual sales compared with less than $1 billion in 2012.Acquisitions have been a key reason LKQ has built scale-driven cost advantages in its business. That said, the companys invested capital base has increased along with the growth in acquisitions over the past decade. Earnings before interest has also grown over the same period, but not at the same pace as invested capital. Adjusted returns on invested capital decreased from approximately 17% in 2015 to about 10% in 2019. During this period, LKQ increased its acquisition activity, which resulted in a larger asset base. Since, the management team has signaled its desire to shift away from its acquisition-heavy strategy, opting to focus more on driving organic growth and cost efficiencies. We believe future acquisitions will more likely be small-tuck-ins as opposed to the large deals of the past. In our view, the pivot in managements acquisition strategy will push adjusted returns on invested capital past 2015 levels, averaging approximately 20% over the next five years. Additionally, we think LKQ is focused on improving its net leverage position (net debt/EBITDA) in the near term. Over the past five years, its net leverage ratio has declined from about 3 times to under 2 times. This resulted in the company reaching investment-grade status. To maintain this level, LKQ will need to focus on improving its cost structure to drive higher EBITDA growth, in our opinion. This will require the company to shift away from making large M&A deals. LKQ did recently acquire Uni-Select, which has pushed its leverage ratio up to 2.4 times. However, we think the company can get its net leverage ratio down under 2 times within 18 months of the deal closing. We also think LKQs competitive position is entrenched enough to fend off competition from smaller players. The companys peers are local and regional players, while LKQ is a national leader. The likelihood of peers winning away market share from LKQ is rather low, in our view. We expect LKQs Europe business to be on better footing in the next couple of years. The companys European operations was built up through multiple acquisitions over the past decade. Today, LKQ is the largest distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in Europe. The management team has shifted its focus away from acquiring more businesses in the region to integrating its operations. We believe LKQ will be successful in its efforts to drive cost efficiencies in Europe through its 1 LKQ Europe initiative. Similar to its efforts in North America over the years, we think LKQ will drive procurement costs down by rationalizing its product portfolio. We also think the company can develop efficient and scalable distribution networks to cost-effectively serve its customer base. We forecast EBITDA margins to grow from 10% currently to nearly 11% by 2024.We do not think LKQs narrow economic moat faces any substantial threats from ESG risks. The company has exposure to emission regulation through its fleet operations. LKQ uses its own trucks to move products between facilities. We think LKQ is investing to position itself to win in a zero-emission world. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the company has launched a six-month pilot for electric trucks. The management team has also expressed its willingness to test fuel-cell trucks in the future. We expect LKQ to be ready for the eventual shift to alternative-power vehicles. Furthermore, we think new emission regulation will likely be introduced gradually over the next decade. This will give LKQ time to invest in next generation products that will aim to reduce emissions.","We assign LKQ a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.The automotive industry is highly cyclical, as its strength depends on employment and income levels, in addition to financing availability. However, we believe LKQ is uniquely positioned to benefit during economic downturns. During periods of economic stress, consumers typically pull back on making new vehicle purchases, opting to keep their current vehicles longer. As accidents occur and vehicles break down, owners turn to alternative parts to get their vehicles back on the road. This results in rising demand for alternative parts providers like LKQ.While LKQ is the market leader in the fragmented alternative parts industry, it does face competition from smaller players. That said, competitors maintain lower order fulfillment rates in comparison. LKQs consistent parts availability and fast delivery are the result of a strong distribution network that can move parts between facilities relatively quickly, ultimately getting them into customers hands fast. We estimate LKQs fulfillment rates to be approximately 95% in aftermarket parts and about 75% for salvage parts. Lastly, the shift away from internal combustion engine vehicles may result in lower demand for repairs in the future. This reality could translate into lower sales for LKQ. The companys success will depend on its ability to provide more EV parts. We do not think this is a major risk for LKQ as we believe its parts inventory will be able to quickly adapt if demand for EVs increases. If auto suppliers materially accelerate their production of EV-related parts, LKQ will be able to shift its procurement efforts to acquire more EVs, in addition to working with its manufacturing partners to develop aftermarket parts. These factors lead us to assign a medium uncertainty rating, given LKQs ability to mitigate each of the risks it faces.","We assign LKQ a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. The rating reflects our overall assessment that the companys balance sheet is sound and the quality of its investing (reinvestment and acquisitions) is fair and supports its competitive positioning. We think LKQs shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think LKQ has a sound balance sheet. its debt balance has steadily declined over the past few years thanks to the management teams focus on improving its net leverage position to reach investment-grade status. These factors lead us to assign a low balance sheet risk for LKQ. We believe the companys debt is manageable, given our expectation that LKQs cash position will improve over our forecast based on its shift from making large M&A deals to small tuck-ins. LKQs investment strategy is fair, in our view. The company has mostly favored inorganic growth historically, but the management team has signaled a pivot in its strategy. We think LKQ will focus more on improving its cost structure and expanding its business organically. Going forward, we expect LKQ to strategically make acquisitions to enhance its product offering. For example, the company recently made a few acquisitions that expanded its footprint in diagnostics. Increasingly, repair work is relying on diagnostic devices for repair data and vehicle calibration. LKQs efforts to expand into diagnostics presents an attractive opportunity to deepen its relationship customers, ultimately removing the need for repair professionals to send vehicles to dealerships for recalibration after making their fixes.In August 2023, LKQ announced acquired Uni-Select in an all-cash deal for $2.1 billion. The purchase price comes out to CAD 48 per share (approximately $35.29). The company funded the deal through a combination of cash on hand and debt. Management said its leverage ratio would rise to 2.4 times at closing before declining to under 2 times within 18 months of close. Including synergies, the deal represented an acquisition multiple of 9.7 times EV/forward 2023 EBITDA. This roughly matched our 10 times EV/forward EBITDA multiple that we calculated using FactSet consensus following the deal announcement. In terms of cost synergies, LKQ is projecting the deal to bring approximately $55 million in annual run-rate synergies by the third year following the close. Given how similar these two businesses are, we think its reasonable to assume LKQ can achieve its cost synergy target. The three synergy buckets include optimizing the combined footprint, lowering procurement costs, and realizing selling, general, and administrative efficiencies.In our view, LKQs capital allocation strategy will be more balanced in the future. We think one of the companys top priorities will be reinvesting in the business. With respect to its distribution network, we believe LKQ will continue building out its regional networks. The deciding factor for customers is whether a distributor has the part theyre looking for and can they get it in their hands quickly to make their repairs. We think LKQ will continue to improve its delivery processes, making it easier for parts to be shipped between its facilities to meet customer demand. We also believe the management team will be able to quickly shift its business to accommodate any increase in EV parts demand. LKQ has a long record of being able to shift procurement efforts based on demand. We also think LKQ will benefit from new revenue streams as a result of increased EV adoption, for example, increased sales of battery-related parts. We believe shareholder distributions are appropriate. We think management is committed to repurchasing shares, evidenced by the recent announcement to increase its share repurchase program by $1 billion to $3.5 billion. This also marks the companys pivot away from making large acquisitions, freeing up more capital to buy back shares. Additionally, management recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.275 previously. LKQ paid its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We also believe the company will return nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders throughout the economic cycle, while also reinvesting in the business. In a midcycle environment, we expect free cash flow to be over $1 billion.","LKQ is a global distributor of non-OEM automotive parts. Initially formed in 1998 as a consolidator of auto salvage operations in the United States, it has since greatly expanded its scope to include distribution of new mechanical and collision parts, specialty auto equipment, and remanufactured and recycled parts in both Europe and North America. It still maintains its auto salvage business and owns over 70 LKQ pick-your-part junkyards. Separate from the self-service business, LKQ purchases over 300,000 salvage automobiles annually that are used to extract parts for resale. Globally, the company maintains approximately 1,700 facilities.","LKQ maintains a sound balance sheet. Its debt balance was $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023. LKQs management team has been focused on strengthening the balance sheet over the past few years. The companys net leverage position (net debt/EBITDA) has steadily improved, declining from nearly 3 times to under 2 times. This resulted in LKQ reaching investment-grade status. Following the Uni-Select deal, LKQ's leverage ratio rose to 2.4 times. We think the company can get its net leverage ratio down under 2 times within 18 months of the deal closing.In terms of liquidity, we believe LKQ will be on solid footing over the long term. Cash stood at $401 million in the third quarter, but we think this will likely increase over our forecast, given the companys shift in its acquisition strategy. In the past, LKQ was more willing to acquire companies to expand its capabilities and footprint. We believe management will now focus on small tuck-ins, freeing up more cash to reinvest in its business, repurchase shares and grow its dividend. We think a stronger cash position will help LKQ quickly react to a changing operating environment as well as meet any near-term debt obligations. In addition, we also find comfort in LKQs ability to access $2.0 billion in credit facilities. LKQs solid balance sheet gives management the financial flexibility to run a balanced capital allocation strategy going forward that mostly favors organic growth and also returns cash to shareholders. We believe LKQ can generate solid free cash flow throughout the economic cycle. We expect the company to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow in our midcycle year, supporting its ability to return free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we think free cash flow growth over the next decade will be supported by improving EBITDA margins in LKQs Europe business, which we expect to be in the low-double-digit range over the next five years.",LKQ,Consumer Cyclical,12175717376.0,NMS,1359364.0,USD,45.7400016784668,True,1,49.128636034801175,48.11212615024198,1
25/11/2023,HCA Retains Narrow Moat as Pressures Begin to Ease on Providers,HCA Healthcare Inc,HCA,3,24/10/2023,Julie Utterback,252.18,USD,24/11/2023,260.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,24/10/2023,"Narrow-moat HCA turned in a weaker-than-anticipated third quarter, which was constrained by underperformance at Velasco, its hospital-based physician venture that may create a moderate profit headwind, going forward. However, underlying trends in its provider services were strong, and our 2023 expectations remain within management's updated outlook. At first glance, we do not see a reason to materially change our $260 fair value estimate, which appears mildly above where shares recently traded. In the quarter, increasing medical utilization continued, although the firm's profits were negatively affected by the pressures felt at Velasco. HCA's revenue rose 8% year over year to $16.2 billion (above FactSet consensus of $15.8 billion) on a roughly 5% increase in equivalent admissions and 4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission, as the return of higher-acuity surgeries helped the firm's core operations. Adjusted EBITDA declined 1% year over year to $2.9 billion, though, as underperformance in Velasco outweighed other factors like easing labor cost concerns. Management highlighted that it needs to enhance the revenue generated by the Velasco services, and until then, Velasco may create a roughly $200 million annual headwind on HCA's operating profits. Considering these factors, management merely narrowed its 2023 guidance ranges for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Our assumptions for 2023 remain within management's new adjusted EPS guidance range of $17.80 to $18.50, which is only slightly different than the company's previous outlook for $17.70-$18.90. While the firm's core operations appear solid, investors may be concerned that Velasco will pressure the firm's 2024 guidance, which management intends to share at its investor day in early November. Even if we mildly cut into the annual run rate of HCA's profits by the $200 million Velasco profit headwind, though, our HCA fair value estimate does not change. HCA aims to mitigate those pressures eventually, as well.","Beyond administrative function efficiency, HCA's large scale gives it an opportunity to test and expand best practices throughout its network of facilities to improve service quality and efficiency. HCA's focus on attractive geographic locations gives it a volume tailwind that should positively affect its top line. The company's financial leverage should be easily manageable, giving HCA flexibility for U.S. healthcare policy changes or other shocks to the system that could constrain demand for the more elective, and highly profitable, parts of its business.","Healthcare policy changes will likely remain a key ESG risk until universal, affordable coverage is achieved in the U.S. The aging population could constrain ROICs at HCA, as its payer mix moves from the more profitable employer-sponsored plans to less profitable government-sponsored plans. Hospitals may be overwhelmed during pandemics or even severe flu seasons, reducing capacity for some highly profitable surgical procedures and cutting into profit prospects during such events.",21/04/2023,"HCA Healthcare operates the largest network of hospitals in the United States, focusing on attractive geographic locations where it has the potential for leading and increasing market share. With headquarters in Nashville and locations in 20 states and England, its facilities are particularly concentrated in Texas and Florida, which represent over half of its bed count. In those states, urban areas of focus include Dallas, Austin, Tampa, and Miami; those geographic areas provide a good sense of the positive demographic factors that the firm aims to benefit from across the country. Within its target markets, HCA aims to expand share through a variety of strategies to attract patients, physicians, and third-party payers. The company provides wide networks of facilities in its chosen geographic markets with key hospital anchors supported by ambulatory surgical centers, urgent-care centers, and physician clinics at convenient access points. HCA aims to be the facility of choice for physicians who are typically free agents with practicing rights to other hospitals in the area. For example, HCA has spent the past decade or so investing in its surgical suites to improve efficiency, nursing, and technology offerings to appeal to surgeons scheduling those procedures and positively influence patient satisfaction, which builds on the reputation of HCA's facilities. From a payer standpoint, HCA continues to contract with health insurers in roughly three-year cycles, which is typically manageable but has caused some concerns in recent years as healthcare labor costs have risen.  Overall though, HCA's strategies have generally yielded positive results over the long run, including market share gains and some of the most efficient and profitable operations in the industry. In the long run, we expect the firm to increase its top line in the midsingle digits and earnings per share in the low double digits.","As the largest hospital operator in the U.S., HCA has amassed enough cost advantages to maintain economic profits for at least the next 10 years, in our opinion. The company typically generates returns on invested capital in the high teens, well above its capital costs, and we expect similar economic profitability to continue during most of our explicit 10-year forecast. Like politics, healthcare services are local, and HCA enjoys significant share in each of its target markets. On a consolidated basis, its local market share stood around 27% at the end of 2022, up from 23% in 2011, and patients, physicians, and payers are increasingly seeking out this organizations services. With that significant and growing share, HCA can negotiate reasonable rates with key health insurers in those local markets. Commercial insurers represented about 30% of inpatient admissions and 48% of total revenue in 2022, as HCA earns more on those patients than on government-based programs. Overall, revenue per equivalent admission, a proxy for pricing, has grown 4% on average during the past 10 years. We expect HCA to enjoy similar low- to mid-single-digit pricing power during the next 10 years in our base-case scenario, which should help it generate economic profits.While the company's local-scale related advantages are important, we think another substantial part of HCAs maintainable competitive advantages are its cost advantages. The company uses analytics from its industry-leading healthcare services database to spread best practices across its network of facilities, which appears to have quality effects and cost-related efficiencies that help HCA achieve top-tier profitability in the hospital space. Based on our calculations and data from the American Hospital Association, HCAs cost structure is typically 10%-15% lower than the average U.S. hospital, which appears to be the most important factor in HCAs much higher (about 800 basis points) operating profitability than the average U.S. hospital.Within its services, management uses its extensive database to identify best practices in terms of quality and cost throughout its operations, which helps the firm maintain a cost advantage, in our opinion. HCA systematically pushes out those best practices throughout its network of facilities to boost productivity. Obviously, quality of care needs to be high, but these more efficient operations can also lead to greater patient, payer, and physician satisfaction, too. For example, HCAs average length of stay is about 10% lower than the average U.S. hospital, which can equate to about half a day less in the hospital per patient. That efficiency can positively influence payer satisfaction with HCAs services, too, as they are likely saving the payer money by reducing the overall hospital day charges. Physicians can also benefit from HCAs more efficient scheduling processes for surgical cases, for example, that can have a direct impact on the income generation of each physician. Also, while much of the companys cost structure is fixed, some major cost inputs, such as labor, have a significant variable component that can be managed through analytical capabilities. For example, HCA pays out nearly half of its revenue in labor-related costs, and since only about half of those costs are fixed, the company can positively influence its profitability by managing the remaining variable labor costs more efficiently through its analytical capabilities. Additionally, we believe part of HCAs cost advantage relates to its negotiation for supplies through its own top-tier group purchasing organization subsidiary.","We see high uncertainty around HCA's cash flows due to the company's substantial financial leverage, significant fixed costs, and the potential for healthcare policy changes that could materially alter HCA's financial prospects, eventually. On the U.S. policy front, HCA faces some uncertainty around how the U.S. healthcare system will operate in the long run. While the Medicare for All threat appears close to 0% in the foreseeable future, uncertainty may surround healthcare providers until universal, affordable healthcare coverage is achieved in the U.S. Currently, we see the most likely policy changes as ways to increase insurance coverage rates, which would actually benefit providers like HCA. However, future policy changes may focus on reducing healthcare inflation, which may eventually eat into profitability at companies like HCA. In general, regulatory actions that affect reimbursement rates could significantly change the profitability of HCA's operations and will likely remain a key ESG risk for HCA in the long run. With its significant fixed-cost infrastructure and debt leverage, HCA's profits may decline due to significant shocks in the U.S. healthcare system, such as the COVID-19-related crisis, especially if those shocks reduce patient volume, reduce average reimbursement rates, or increase ongoing costs. HCA faces some cyclicality when elective procedures are delayed in uncertain economic times, too, as not only volume but the mix of procedures or services can turn negative. From a financial leverage perspective, the company's large debt balance creates an ongoing servicing need that could also exacerbate a large contraction in operating profitability.","We give HCA a Standard Capital Allocation Rating based on its weak balance sheet, mixed distribution strategy, and fair investment record. While financial leverage remains manageable and the firm recently reduced its leverage target, HCA still operates with a weak balance sheet by our methodology's standards. The sheer size of HCA's net leverage relative to its enterprise value is a key constraint. HCA remains a split-rated debt issuer, and we think it will probably need to access the debt markets to meet its obligations and its ambitious shareholder distribution goals. HCA's shareholder distribution record appears mixed to us. Because of its ambitious shareholder distribution goals, the company may have to issue debt. While that probably is not a big concern if interest rates do not rise much further, HCA's dependence on the debt market to fund shareholder returns suggests that its distribution strategy may be too high. Also, uncertainty in early 2020 caused HCA to suspend its dividend. While that dividend was reinstated in early 2021, and hopefully the pandemic conditions will prove to be an anomaly, investors may not appreciate such fits and starts with their dividend distributions. The company plans to make significant share repurchases in the next few years. While we do not think those activities will destroy significant value, they may require debt financing, which is not ideal, in our opinion.From an investment perspective, HCA has a fair record, in our opinion. It returns on invested capital including goodwill are typically in the high teens and would be the envy of most U.S. healthcare service providers. We think management has done an effective job investing both internally in its facilities and through reasonably priced tuck-in acquisitions. For example, internally, HCA has spent the past decade or so investing heavily in its surgical suites to improve efficiency, nursing, and technology offerings to appeal to surgeons scheduling those procedures and positively influence patient satisfaction. Those efforts contribute to a positive reputation for its facilities that can help HCA expand local market share over a long period of time.","HCA Healthcare is a Nashville-based healthcare provider organization operating the largest collection of acute-care hospitals in the United States. As of December 2022, the firm owned and operated 182 hospitals, 126 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, and a broad network of physician offices, urgent-care clinics, and freestanding emergency rooms across 20 states and a small foothold in England.","At the end of 2022, the company owed about $38 billion in debt with gross leverage around 3 times, near the low end of HCA's leverage target of 3.0-4.0 times. At the end of 2022, HCA held just under $1 billion in cash after returning the government aid that it was originally granted during the COVID-19 health crisis. With those liquid resources at its disposal and free cash flows expected to range between roughly $4 billion and $7 billion annually during the next five years, HCA should be able to manage its debt maturities during the next five years through internal means. Those maturities include $0.4 billion due in 2023, $2.4 billion due in 2024, $4.7 billion due in 2025, $5.3 billion in 2026, and $2.4 billion in 2027. However, the company plans to return significant cash to stakeholders going forward. As of February 2023, the company was authorized to repurchase about $5 billion in shares, which it expects to use in the next couple of years. Also, HCA just reinstated its dividend ($0.7 billion annual run rate), which was temporarily suspended during the the pandemic. The company distributed about $1.0 billion in cash to noncontrolling interests in 2022, and we would expect those outflows to grow with earnings. We expect HCA's planned distributions to stakeholders may lead to more debt issuance to refinance maturities or even to finance some of these outflows to stakeholders.",HCA,Healthcare,67546927104.0,NYQ,974448.0,USD,252.17999267578125,True,0,252.43389300177654,290.3248423134366,1
24/11/2023,Energy Transfer Has Acquired Crestwood,Energy Transfer LP,ET,4,,Stephen Ellis,13.74,USD,23/11/2023,17.5,Medium,,Poor,B,,No Text Available,"Energy Transfer's consolidation in October 2018 reduced the company's cost of capital and helped fund its growth projects over the last few years. Energy Transfer is diversified across markets, commodities, and geographies giving the company access to many large customers. Energy Transfer is well positioned to benefit from our outlook for growing natural gas liquids exports.","A long-running legal battle threatens to halt operations on the Dakota Access pipeline, demonstrating the substantial legal and regulatory risk Energy Transfer faces. Energy Transfer has historically been active in the M&A market, exposing the firm to the risk of overpaying for growth as the Enable transaction demonstrates. Rising interest rates could make Energy Transfer's distribution less attractive as a fixed-income alternative and raise the company's cost of capital.",07/11/2023,"In the past decade, Energy Transfer has built itself into one of the largest midstream energy companies with an enviable network of natural gas infrastructure, primarily in Texas and the U.S. midcontinent region. Energy Transfer has both contributed to and benefited from the U.S. shale oil and gas boom.  Despite the Lotus deal completed in May 2023 and Crestwood in November 2023, Energy Transfer is working on its next round of growth projects and capital allocation. Growth capital spending (excluding the acquisition cost of Lotus) is expected to be about $2 billion this year. However, Energy Transfer highlighted its desire to spend up to $3 billion or more over the long run, exceeding the top end of its guided $2 billion to $3 billion range. Given historical returns on capital have been poor, we remain skeptical of the partnerships ability to drive excess returns.  The Lake Charles liquefied natural gas, or LNG, project remains somewhat stalled. The Department of Energy denied Energy Transfers request for a deadline extension for the completion of the facility (currently set for December 2028) in April and again at a rehearing in June. As a result, Energy Transfer intends to file a new export authorization for the project in August. This likely will mean substantial further delays until a final investment decision, as the project would essentially go to the back of the line for permit approval behind multiple U.S. LNG projects that have already applied for approval. Still, in July 2023, it signed nonbinding agreements for 3.6 million metric tons per year of LNG offtake, and it has two potential equity partners that may wish to take a stake and/or contract for supply. Energy Transfer wants to only retain about a 25% stake in this effort eventually.  Energy Transfer does have an alternative energy group, focused on renewables and reducing its environmental footprint. Historically, the group focused on dual-drive compressors (electric/gas), which lowered greenhouse gas emissions. More recently, those efforts have expanded to include carbon capture utilization and storage, sourcing renewable energy for Energy Transfer's own use, and solar and wind projects.","We believe Energy Transfer has no economic moat. Energy Transfer's diversification across the U.S. energy value chain increased its share of assets and earnings from no-moat commodity-sensitive businesses with more volatile earnings. Weve seen this result in more earnings volatility over the last five years, with returns on invested capital also being highly volatile despite its status as the industrys largest player in terms of EBITDA. The partnership benefited from large one-time benefits from winter storm Uri in 2021 for example. Energy Transfer's business mix is 27% natural gas liquids and refined products, 22% crude oil, 21% natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines, 18% gathering and processing, and 12% contributions from ownership stakes in public entities (Sunoco and USA Compression Partners). Despite having a much smaller natural gas business than peer Kinder Morgan, Energy Transfer generated 2.4 times greater profits than Kinder during the February 2021 winter storm. Next, Energy Transfer does not disclose its take-or-pay contract exposure across its entire business, a commonly disclosed industry metric, leading us to believe it prefers to retain exposure to more volatile markets and capture wider spreads and incremental volumes versus protecting its downside exposure. Finally, Energy Transfer continues to pursue aggressive mergers and acquisitions to consolidate the industry, and we believe it materially overpaid for its Enable acquisition.As a result, with a very narrow spread between our forecast returns on invested capital and our cost of capital, we have very little confidence that returns will more likely than not exceed our cost of capital on a 10-year horizon given the partnerships preference for a more aggressive stance on its assets and its willingness to overpay for deals.Broadly, we consider Energy Transfers interstate and intrastate pipelines to be some of the best assets it owns. However, the quality of these assets is diluted because a material portion of the profits for even these attractive business units is driven by related assets such as gas storage, where profits are far more volatile. We believe Energy Transfers interstate pipelines and Texas network are exceptionally well positioned, with high returns and efficient scale competitive advantages. Its $2.4 billion pretax profit during the weeklong 2021 winter storm in Texas shows how Energy Transfer's extensive system allows it to maximize profits in its home region unlike any other midstream firm.We also think interstate gas pipelines are moaty because of high barriers to entry characterized by high capital costs and significant regulatory oversight. Midstream moats are primarily earned via an efficient scale moat source. Efficient scale refers to situations where companies are effectively serving a very limited market size, and potential competitors have little incentive to enter the market because by doing so, they would lower the industrys returns to below the cost of capital. While the midstream industry is massive, individual companies connect a limited number of markets to one another. Therefore, the underlying routes they serve can each be considered individual, localized markets to which efficient scale applies. Even though low-cost shale oil and gas production in North America has grown rapidly, we've seen little evidence of speculative capacity additions with the majority of a pipelines takeaway capacity being contracted before starting construction, ensuring that new capacity is added in an efficient manner.Midstream markets exhibit several of the characteristics we look for in efficient scale markets. Demand for oil and gas products is growing slowly and should peak within the next decade or two, discouraging potential new entrants. Incremental demand can be met by incumbent companies at a very low cost, typically via compression, twinning a pipeline, or other means, making it difficult for new entrants to see a profitable investment opportunity. Demand is also fairly inelastic for oil and gas, meaning potential new entrants cant simply undercut existing operators on price to gain market entry. There are also significant barriers to entry in terms of multi-billion-dollar investments to build new pipelines and related investments as well as satisfying regulatory and other stakeholder concerns, which have only increased in recent years. Finally, exiting the market is extremely difficult, as assets can operate for decades safely with minimal maintenance investment, and repurposing older pipelines that may have low utilization for a higher and better use is a key skill set of good midstream management teams.New pipelines are typically constructed to allow shippers or producers to take advantage of large price differentials (basis differentials) between two market hubs because supply and demand is out of balance in both markets. Pipeline operators will enter into long-term contracts with shippers to recover the projects construction and development costs as well as a return on capital, in exchange for a reasonable tariff that allows a shipper to capture a profitable differential, and capacity will be added until it is no longer profitable to do so. Pipelines are approved by regulators only when there is an economic need, and pipeline development takes years. Regulatory oversight is provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and at the state and local levels, and new pipelines under consideration have to contend with onerous environmental and other permitting issues. A network of pipelines serving multiple end markets and supplied by multiple regions is typically more valuable than a scattered collection of assets. A pipeline network allows the midstream firm to optimize the flow of hydrocarbons across the system and capture geographic differentials, use storage facilities to capture price differentials over time, and direct more hydrocarbons through its system via storage and gathering and processing assets, ensuring security of flows and higher fees. Energy Transfer's legacy Texas intrastate pipeline network is unmatched by competitors. Its interconnectivity creates an unparalleled system for moving gas across Texas to the best market at any given time. It is the largest intrastate pipeline network in the U.S. overlaying the top gas-producing state in the country. We consider this an efficient scale advantage.The Texas system is large enough to serve the entire states gas demand all year. Thus, if Texas customers want to buy or sell gas, Energy Transfers network is their only option. This network is big enough that it requires little incremental capital investment and supports high returns on capital. Even when throughput has lagged, Energy Transfer has such strong pricing power that it raises reservation fees, keeping margins steady and growing through commodity cycles.But the share of its moaty gas transportation and storage business is shrinking as Energy Transfer invests elsewhere. Half of Energy Transfer's cash flows stem from a combination of crude-oil pipelines, natural gas liquids services, fractionation, crude-oil marketing, and other businesses. Although these typically have short-term economics locked in, their long-term economics are highly sensitive to commodity markets and prices. We expect the initial contracts for these assets, particularly pipelines to be attractive and 10-20 years to recover the large upfront investments. However, rates can decline substantially and become more volatile with subsequent contracts that reflect a more competitive market and shorter terms. Energy Transfers size and exposure across multiple basins with more challenging break-evens make it especially challenging. We think the lack of regulation and the sensitivity to commodity prices and volumes make long-term returns on the newer businesses less certain than long-term returns on its legacy assets. Our projections show the newer businesses produce thin margins and will require continued liquids volume growth to produce value-accretive returns in the long term. Energy Transfers customers are increasingly becoming producers and other marketers, moving away from demand-side customers such as utilities and industrial firms that make its Texas operations so attractive. These trends tend to reinforce Energy Transfers more aggressive reliance on spreads and marketing efforts to capture profits. Another hurdle in the oil-related businesses is regulatory support. Energy Transfer has struggled with regulatory challenges, particularly related to its interest in the Dakota Access pipeline and other oil-related projects. Higher costs and construction delays have hurt returns on capital. Even after clearing steep regulatory hurdles to bring Dakota Access into service in 2017, it still faces regulatory and legal challenges that could shut it down.For its other crude-oil businesses, Energy Transfer takes possession of the certain commodity and uses its terminals, trucks, and other storage assets to capture volatility. These tend to be high-risk businesses with competition from large integrated energy companies.Material environmental, social, and governance exposures create additional risk for midstream investors. Energy Transfer is rated severe risk by Sustainalytics, reflecting concerns over stakeholder risks with the Dakota Access pipeline system as one example that we believe supports our no moat stance. In this industry, the most significant exposures are greenhouse gas emissions (from upstream extraction, midstream operations, and downstream consumption) and other emissions, effluents, pipeline spills, and opposition and protests. In addition to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as production limits, removal of existing infrastructure, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions.Midstream emissions are relatively low in the life cycle of oil and gas, and midstream firms have relatively lower risk than upstream and downstream firms from carbon taxes. Canadian firms already pay carbon taxes on their carbon emissions, most of which are generally passed to their shippers and other customers. Spills represent a major threat and have created great resistance from environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and other climate-conscious people. Examples of the opposition are seen in President Joe Bidens revocation of the Keystone XL presidential permit and the legal challenges with the Dakota Access Pipeline system.Energy Transfer has yet to lay out any material ESG-related targets related to greenhouse gas emissions.","We award Energy Transfer a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium.Material ESG exposures include greenhouse gas emissions (from upstream extraction, midstream operations, and downstream consumption) and other emissions, effluents, pipeline spills, and opposition and protests.In addition to the reputational threat, these issues could force climate-conscious consumers away from fossil fuels in greater numbers, resulting in long-term demand erosion. Climate concerns could also trigger regulatory interventions, such as production limits, removal of existing infrastructure, and perhaps even direct taxes on carbon emissions. Midstream emissions are relatively low in the lifecycle of oil and gas, and midstream firms have relatively lower risk than upstream and downstream firms from carbon taxes. The partnership is also exposed to cash flow volatility because of changes in margins and volumes for various energy products. Although most of Energy Transfer's margins are fee-based, those fees can fluctuate through commodity cycles. The potential for significant natural gas production shortfalls in key Texas areas and changes in the regulatory environment are also key risks for the core transportation business. Energy Transfer also has increasing exposure to oil and liquids markets.The Dakota Access pipeline, one of Energy Transfer's largest assets, remains under legal and regulatory attack. If the pipeline ultimately must shut down, it would have a material impact on earnings and cash flow.Investors should be aware of interest-rate sensitivity because many investors consider MLPs to be bond surrogates. Rising interest rates would probably pressure unit prices and raise Energy Transfer's cost of capital for new investments.","We give Energy Transfer a Poor capital allocation rating. Management's capital allocation strategy will be tested as the company reaches its balance sheet goals, integrates Enable, and begins accruing cash from its recent growth projects. Energy Transfer is facing several years of limited growth opportunities, forcing management to find other ways to allocate capital, and unsurprisingly, it is seeking a new area for investment, which is petrochemicals. We remain skeptical of any success here. Management deserves credit for continually navigating legal, regulatory, and political hurdles in its business. However, we think management has been overly aggressive using shareholder capital for acquisitions instead of returning capital to shareholders through unit buybacks when the units have been exceptionally cheap or through distribution increases. Energy Transfer's acquisitive past opens up the risk of overpaying for assets, especially as organic growth opportunities slow. The Enable deal is the latest example of the management team's overpayment for assets, and we note over $7 billion in impairments and other charges over the past several years. We remain similarly skeptical of any excess returns on Lotus Midstream which was completed in May 2023 and Crestwood, which was completed in November 2023.Similarly, we're not huge fans of Energy Transfer's top priority being to increase the distribution to $1.22 a unit annually from $0.61 a unit, with multiple increases in the distribution in 2022, with its stock remaining materially below our fair value estimate. As expected, Energy Transfer boosted the payout to $1.22 a unit in early 2023, and its current payout stands a bit higher, while passing on unit buybacks. Further distribution increases are expected to be more modest in the 3%-5% range annually. The Energy Transfer family consolidation in October 2018 alleviated many of the conflicts of interest inherent in the partnership structure. Most importantly, we think the elimination of incentive distribution rights, or IDRs, was positive for all unitholders. However, the transaction resulted in an effective distribution cut for limited partners to benefit of the general partners.Energy Transfer seems to be considering a C-Corporation conversion, or C-Corp, alternative more seriously than it has in the past as an alternative to buybacks. Co-CEO Thomas Long said he thinks the C-Corp currency makes a lot of sense, and the company is spending considerable time evaluating it. This shift seems to suggest that Energy Transfer management may have thought the stock would rerate higher with the increased yield (currently 9%), but in the absence of that, it may consider a C-Corp conversion to address the long-standing EBITDA multiple discount versus peers.","Energy Transfer owns a large platform of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid assets primarily in Texas and the U.S. midcontinent region. It also has gathering and processing facilities, one of the largest fractionation facilities in the U.S., and fuel distribution. Energy Transfer also owns the Lake Charles gas liquefaction facility. It combined its publicly traded limited and general partnerships in October 2018.","Energy Transfer has been quite successful with its debt reduction efforts, eliminating over $3 billion since 2020, which is impressive. Leverage is expected to be 3.7 times for 2023. Broadly, we think Energy Transfers leverage position is now reasonable. The partnership is now rated investment-grade, which was one of management's earlier goals.Initially, management mentioned focusing more on the distribution and unit buybacks in 2022 now that it has essentially achieved its leverage goals. We think this approach as originally outlined allows for a more balanced allocation of capital across debt reduction, distribution increases, and buybacks. However, management focused on a return of the distribution to $1.22 (now exceeded) annually with multiple distribution increases in 2022 and 2023. Further annual distribution increases are expected to be about 3%-5% in the future. Buybacks are well down on the list of priorities after ongoing leverage management, and growth capital investment, though management seems to be exploring a potential C-Corp conversion instead of aggressive buybacks to address its long-standing valuation discount versus peers. Further industry consolidation is nearly always in the mix as Energy Transfer considers itself a successful consolidator, as its recent deals for Enable, Lotus, and Crestwood show.

25/11/2023,Paychex Benefits From a Resilient SMB Market and Sticky Clients Despite Macro Headwinds ,Paychex Inc,PAYX,3,27/09/2023,Emma Williams,118.5,USD,24/11/2023,120.0,High,Wide,Exemplary,A,27/09/2023,"Wide-moat Paychex reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with top-line growth exceeding our expectations and profitability broadly in line. Following the result, we have marginally lifted our full-year forecasts to the upper end of guidance, but our longer-term forecasts and $120 fair value estimate are unchanged. Paychexs longstanding and well-respected CFO, Efrain Rivera, will retire in October 2023 and be succeeded by Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations Bob Schrader. We expect no material shift to the firms strategy or capital allocation on the back of this leadership change. At current prices, Paychex shares screen as fairly valued relative to our valuation. Revenue in the first quarter increased a healthy 7% year over year, underpinned by new client wins and worksite employee growth, and higher revenue per client on like-for-like price increases and greater product attach. Paychex continues to enjoy regulatory tailwinds driving demand for retirement solutions and ongoing uptake of employee retention tax credit services. The firm is also reaping benefits from investment in expanding and promoting its insurance product suite, and a resilient SMB market with modest hiring activity and healthy client retention. Paychex achieved improved profitability year over year during the quarter on greater contribution from ultra-high-margin interest income and improved operating leverage on a larger client base. This supported a 60-basis-point operating margin expansion to an impressive 41.7%, partly offset by higher employee compensation and continued investment in product innovation and marketing.","Paychex is well placed to benefit from increased regulatory complexity under a U.S. Democratic administration. Paychex benefits from high customer switching costs, a scale-based cost advantage, and strong brand assets and a referral network built over many decades. Paychex dominates the small-business outsourced payroll market with strong prospects of further market penetration.","Paychex faces increasing competitive pressure from nimble upstarts, legacy peers, and accounting software providers encroaching on the full-service market. This dynamic will likely lead to greater pricing pressure for Paychex and continued elevated investment in software development. Payroll and HCM software is becoming increasingly commoditized, and newer operators will look to gradually develop their own record of performance. Paychex is highly exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets. ",27/09/2023,"Paychex's offering appeals to businesses wishing to outsource mission-critical functions, manage and attract employees, and remain compliant with increasingly complex and evolving regulations. We expect increased regulatory complexity, tight labor markets, and a growing adoption of hybrid work will underpin strong demand for Paychex's suite of offerings supporting greater share of wallet and market share gains. This includes greater penetration of the outsourced payroll and human resources model in the small-business market. While we factor in market share gains, we expect increasing competition to limit Paychex's pricing power and force the company to maintain elevated expenditure on software development and innovation to remain competitive.  Paychex's solutions span from do-it-yourself payroll with add-on human capital management modules to full-service HR outsourcing via an administrative services organization or professional employer organization model. The ASO and PEO solutions allow a business to outsource critical HR functions to Paychex, including payroll, compliance, and benefits administration, and access support from onsite HR professionals. The main difference between the two models is that under a PEO, Paychex enters a co-employment arrangement and acts as the employer of record for tax and insurance purposes. Clients can benefit from Paychex's scale to secure competitively priced benefits, allowing them to attract and retain talent and minimize expenses. Paychex also operates an insurance agency business and offers stand-alone solutions such as retirement services administration. Paychex differentiates itself from software-only solutions through its 24/7 customer service support, allowing clients to source advice on HR and compliance matters.  We expect Paychex to continue to diversify its revenue streams away from payroll through increased focus on HR solutions, including outsourcing and insurance. By fiscal 2033, we expect payroll revenue will contribute about 36% of total revenue from an estimated 41% in 2023. The remainder of revenue will be evenly split among the PEO and insurance business and HCM solutions, including through the ASO. ","Paychex has a wide economic moat underpinned by high customer switching costs. It also benefits from intangible assets, including its brand strength accumulated over several decades, an extensive referral network, and cost advantages due to economies of scale. Despite facing intense competitive pressure from legacy peers, nimble cloud native upstarts, and accounting software providers, Paychex has improved retention and achieved steady underlying operating margin expansion over the past decade. While we expect returns on invested capital to continue to come under pressure due to consistent investment in software development and pricing pressure, we are comfortable that Paychex will be able to earn maintainable economic profits for at least the next 20 years. Paychex dominates the small-business outsourced payroll processing market, servicing over 740,000 clients primarily in the United States. We estimate 95% of these clients are in the highly fragmented 1- to 49-employee small-business market, representing an estimated 11% market share. Approximately 65% of this market is serviced by regional providers or do-it-yourself software-only solutions such as Intuit's QuickBooks or Microsoft Excel, creating meaningful scope for greater penetration of Paychex's value-added offering. As of fiscal 2021, Paychex's average clients number of employees was in the midteens and we estimate at least 80% of clients employ fewer than 20 people. Paychex also services the lower end of the midmarket categorized by 50-999 employees, with an estimated 15% market share in fiscal 2023. As with payroll and HCM peers, Paychex benefits from high customer switching costs. Payroll and HCM software is typically deeply embedded in a business' operations, making it a costly and time-intensive process to switch providers. Alongside monetary costs, a business could face operational disruptions and inefficiencies, including having to train employees on the new system and integrate the new solution with other software and risk losing data as a result. These switching costs are magnified for customers that outsource HR functions to Paychex through the admin-only (ASO) or co-employment models (PEO). These models that allow a customer to outsource mission-critical HR operations such as recruitment, compliance, and benefits administration are deeply entrenched in a business' day-to-day operations. Despite facing intense competitive pressure, Paychex has modestly improved client retention to 84% on average over the five years to 2023, relative to 83% over the 10 years to 2023. Considering that approximately 8.5% of annual client losses are attributed to business failures, we view this retention as reflective of high switching costs. Further, Paychex's retention surpasses the retention of competitors in the small-business market, including Intuit's QuickBooks and Xero, of around 80%. Over the long run, we expect Paychex will continue to invest in software development, customer service, and user experience to maintain customer satisfaction and high retention rates. Maintaining high customer retention allows Paychex to earn a steady stream of recurring revenue at low marginal cost. Paychex has expanded its offering over the past decade to include a broad range of HCM solutions, including HR outsourcing, benefits, and insurance services, in addition to traditional payroll. Paychex offers bundled and unbundled solutions as well as integration capabilities to complementary small-business software, including accounting software and point-of-sale technology, as well as job listing website Indeed. Customers can upgrade their Paychex software to include modules such as benefits administration and time and attendance, increasing the stickiness of the business. Small-business customers tend to prefer all-in-one bundled solutions rather than integrating several providers, making them prime targets for Paychex to upsell modules to. Over the five years to fiscal 2021, demand for retirement services plans and health and benefits insurance outpaced total client growth. Paychex has built a strong reputation over many decades for delivering reliable and compliant solutions for hundreds of thousands of small-business clients, allowing it to win market share and charge premium pricing. Payroll is a highly sensitive and mission-critical operation for all businesses that place a high value on reliability, accuracy, compliance, and data security. The potential ramifications of failing to make payroll on time or accurately, being noncompliant with applicable laws, or breaching data security can be severe. We expect Paychex has a reputation advantage over smaller, younger operators that lack a record of performance and can attract new business over these operators. Further, Paychex has fostered a powerful distribution relationship with accounting bodies in the United States, banks, and existing clients, with over half of new small-business payroll customers coming through a referral. Despite fierce competition from younger, nimble providers such as Gusto and Paylocity, as well as ADP increasing its presence in the small-business market in recent years, Paychex has been able to win market share, which we attribute to the strength of its intangible assets. Paychex has traditionally charged premium pricing; however, this has diminished somewhat in recent years due to increasing competitive pressures. Paychex benefits from a cost advantage stemming from economies of scale, creating an advantage over small operators. Paychex is the leading provider of outsourced payroll and HCM solutions to the small-business market in the U.S., paying 1 in 12 private-sector workers. This scale allows Paychex to spread its fixed capital investment, namely software development, and marketing spending over a larger base, affording the company a lower marginal cost relative to smaller operators. For instance, younger operator Paylocity, with a client base 4% the size of Paychexs, was paying about 45% of revenue on selling, general, and administrative expense over the five years to fiscal 2021, compared with 32% for Paychex. The incremental cost of adding a new customer to the platform is minimal and creates material operating leverage for Paychex. Increasingly, small-business clients are using self-service technology to demo, purchase, and onboard themselves to the platform without engaging sales or customer-service teams, further reducing the cost to serve for Paychex. We expect its superior cost position will provide adequate headway for Paychex to combat pricing pressure from competitors and upsell additional modules to existing clients at a lower cost, increasing the stickiness of the business.","Paychex has diversified its revenue away from a reliance on payroll, but it remains highly exposed to swings in economic conditions and labor markets, underpinning our high uncertainty rating. This exposure is magnified by Paychex's reliance on small-business clients, which are more likely to fail during an economic downturn. As an example, Paychex's client base shrank 6% between 2008 and 2010 before staging a gradual recovery to pre-Great Recession levels by 2014. Since the Great Recession, Paychex has increased its exposure to larger clients but remains at the mercy of economic conditions. This also includes upside uncertainty, as we expect Paychex would benefit from new business formation, tighter labor markets, and higher yields on client funds during an economic boom. The company benefited from government stimulus in the COVID-19 recession, which propped up small businesses and created greater regulatory complexity and demand for Paychex's administration and compliance services. Paychex's environmental, social, and governance risk is low. Paychex handles high volumes of sensitive, personally identifiable information for its customers and their employees, exposing the company to data privacy and security risk; however, we view this risk as immaterial to our uncertainty rating. If a data security breach or breaching of data privacy laws were to occur, Paychex would be exposed to regulatory fines, civil lawsuits, or reputational damage. However, Paychex has reasonable measures in place to mitigate this risk, including industry-standard data-protection technologies, regular employee training, a data security team, and executive-level responsibility for information security. Paychex is bound by regional data regulations, and it has had no material data privacy or security breaches.","We assign Paychex an Exemplary capital allocation rating based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet risk, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. Paychex's balance sheet health is sound. Paychex operates a capital-light business model with strong free cash flow generation and typically boasts a net cash position. The company is actively exploring bolt-on acquisitions to expand its suite of human capital management solutions and increase scale in the PEO business. We expect Paychex could comfortably increase gearing to support these acquisitions, as well as continued investment in internally generated software. Given the uncertainty around timing and pricing, we do not explicitly forecast acquisitions. In the absence of attractive acquisition targets or internal investment opportunities, we would expect Paychex to return excess cash to shareholders through increasing the payout ratio beyond 80% of net income or increasing share repurchases. We assess Paychex's investment efficacy as exceptional. Paychex has acquired several PEO businesses in recent years to expand scale and enter new markets, with the largest being the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Oasis for $1.2 billion. This acquisition propelled Paychex to become the second-largest PEO provider in the U.S. after ADP. While Paychex faced initial integration challenges related to consolidating sales processes and underwriting practices, we expect it will be able to achieve scale benefits from technology investments and synergy benefits from cross-selling in coming years. Through internal and acquisitive investment, we expect Paychex to continue to expand its suite of HCM software to remain competitive and take greater share of clients' wallets, increasing switching costs. Paychex's shareholder distributions are appropriate. The company has returned over $8 billion to shareholders over the eight years to fiscal 2023 primarily through dividends and to a lesser extent share repurchases. Paychex undertakes regular share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact from its equity compensation plan. While these repurchases have typically been executed at share prices above our fair value estimate, the quantum of the premium paid is immaterial. We expect Paychex can comfortably continue to pay out 80% of net income over our forecast period, which is in line with the company's target.","Paychex is a leading provider of payroll, human capital management, and insurance solutions servicing small and midsize clients primarily in the United States. The company, established in 1979, services over 740,000 clients and pays over 1 in 12 U.S. private-sector workers. Alongside its traditional payroll services, Paychex offers HCM solutions such as benefits administration and time and attendance software, as well as human resources outsourcing and insurance agency services.","Paychex is in a strong financial position. At the end of fiscal 2023, Paychex had a net cash position of about $800 million, including restricted cash and total corporate investments. In fiscal 2019, the company issued $800 million of fixed-rate long-term debt to fund the $1.2 billion acquisition of PEO business Oasis. We expect Paychex's annual operating income to comfortably cover interest expense on this debt at least 50 times over our forecast period. Paychex has returned over $8 billion of capital to shareholders during the nine years to fiscal 2023 primarily through dividends and to a lesser extent share repurchases. We expect Paychex's strong free cash flow generation will support an 80% dividend payout ratio over our forecast period. The balance sheet is robust, and Paychex has ample cash and scope to increase leverage to execute bolt-on acquisition plans.",PAYX,Industrials,44763869184.0,NMS,1625865.0,USD,118.5,True,0,116.56837445427533,121.37767177674267,1
24/11/2023,Webjet Earnings Are Still on an Ascent,Webjet Ltd,WEB,3,22/11/2023,Brian Han,6.75,AUD,24/11/2023,6.8,High,,Standard,,22/11/2023,"The 41% jump in Webjet's fiscal 2024 first-half underlying EBITDA to AUD 102 million was devoid of any major surprises. It shows the group is on track to meet our unchanged AUD 189 million underlying EBITDA forecast for fiscal 2024, excluding share-based payment expenses which we estimate will be AUD 6 million. We are content to sit at the top end of management's guidance of AUD 180 million to AUD 190 million for two reasons. First, our second-half EBITDA year-on-year growth forecast of 31% for WebBeds is below the 41% achieved in the first half. It sufficiently accounts for the potential impact of the current geopolitical crisis on the Middle East and European businesses. We also expect scale and operating leverage benefits from recent investments (61% increase in first-half WebBeds costs) to help maintain the strong momentum in bookings and total transaction value, up 32% and 46%, respectively, in the first half. Second, we expect the online travel agency unit to generate AUD 27 million in underlying EBITDA in the second half. This would be AUD 5 million higher than a year ago and slightly above guidance. But we anticipate the remnant benefits of Trip Ninja integration to come through. The software to facilitate complex, multistop itinerary flight bookings contributed AUD 2 million to the division's first-half AUD 5 million EBITDA increase and is opening up new revenue streams for the business. Furthermore, the imminent return of international capacity back to pre-COVID-19 levels should magnify the earnings benefits of continuing improvement in efficiency in the OTA unit. We retain our AUD 6.80 fair value estimate for Webjet, with these two reasons supporting our largely unchanged longer-term group earnings forecasts (five-year EBITDA CAGR of 17%). Investors appear increasingly cognisant of this solid earnings growth outlook, with shares in the no-moat-rated group rallying in recent weeks to be broadly in line with our intrinsic assessment.","In an increasing complex post-pandemic travel environment, the value add of an online travel agent may increase as swift border closures and travel restrictions require customers to quickly change their itineraries or cancel bookings.  Investments made to increase the technological capabilities of the group generate scalability benefits as travel activities return to pre-COVID-19 numbers. Slowing competition from brick-and-mortar travel agents could increase the size of the online travel market, where Webjet has sufficient scale and market presence to capture demand.","Travel conditions are likely to remain volatile due to uncertain economic conditions. Travel suppliers may increasingly leverage their own technological capabilities to engage in direct bookings with customers. Webjet is a highly cyclical business and is susceptible to many externalities, competition is fierce and differentiation in service offering is minimal. Furthermore, poor integration of new technologies onto Webjet platforms could damage supplier and consumer relationships causing them to switch to competitors.",22/11/2023,"Webjets largest operating unit is its B2B booking platform, WebBeds. The business contracts supply from independent hotels, chains and third-party providers, aggregates and supplies the inventory to travel retailers. The business allows smaller hotels to increase distribution channels. For travel intermediaries, WebBeds increases the available inventory for end customers. The B2B accommodation market is estimated to be AUD 70 billion, when measured by total transaction volume, or TTV. Around 80% of this market is made up of independent hotels, representing a significant target market of suppliers lacking the distribution and marketing resources to maintain limited vacancies without the use of a B2B distributor.  Webjet also operates in the B2C market as an online travel agent, called Webjet OTA. As at 2023, Webjet is the largest provider within the Australian and New Zealand OTA market, capturing 50% of OTA flight bookings in Australia and New Zealand. The group also provides ancillary services through its car and caravan booking business, GoSee.  Webjets key objective is to grow market share, through leveraging scale and technology, to be one of the lowest cost travel providers. Since inception in 1998, Webjet has completed six acquisitions. Acquisitions within the B2B sector allow Webjet's WebBeds to quickly increase scale and inventory through access to new hotel contracts. In turn, the company can expand its customer base.  This strategy has proven successful to date, with the most recent purchases of Jacktravel in 2017 for AUD 330 million and Destinations of the World in 2018 for AUD 240 million significantly boosting WebBeds' B2B TTV. Unfortunately, this has concealed organic growth, the rate of which is difficult to ascertain given the highly competitive and cyclical nature of the industry. We believe there is still consumer pent-up demand to resume travel, with Webjet already reaching prepandemic profitability in fiscal 2023 and more growth to come. But some reservations about the source of discretionary dollars to fund that pent-up demand may be warranted, especially in an environment of rising living costs and precarious economic conditions.","We do not view Webjet as having an economic moat.WebBeds (around 60% of forecast group midcycle EBITDA) is an additional-layer middleman in the hotel accommodation bookings value chain. It provides a platform for hotels to allocate rooms on a wholesale basis and then distributes these rooms to B2B and B2C customers, generating commissions in the process. Inventory is sourced via direct contracts with hotels (55%), third parties such as other wholesalers (30%) and large hotel chains (15%). On the demand side, WebBeds sells inventory to retail travel agents (32%), corporate travel agents (20%), tour operators (8%), OTAs (17%), wholesalers (20%) and super apps (3%). We believe there is a risk of disintermediation longer term. First, small independent or boutique hotels (85% of WebBeds' inventory) are particularly susceptible to increasing competition from peer-to-peer online accommodation agencies, such as HomeAway (bought by Expedia in 2015) and narrow moat-rated AirBnB. These intimate, ""home stay"" accommodations offer a differentiated proposition to the large homogenous offerings of hotel chains, and are situated at more diverse locationsprecisely the attributes that small, independent or boutique hotels market themselves as offering. Second, as a B2B distribution channel, WebBeds supplies hotel inventory to B2C operators, not the end hotel patrons. The scale of these OTAs (such as narrow moat-rated Bookings and Expedia) is material and poses a risk that hotel inventory suppliers across all segments (large chains, medium hotels, independents, boutiques) may deal more directly with the B2C OTAs, or the end hotel patron overtime. Third, the unit serves as an additional distribution platform for small, independent or boutique hotels (around 85% of inventory, large-chain hotels provide the rest). We expect to see gradual consolidation amongst hotels in the long-term. Large hotel chains have consistently been making bolt-on acquisitions of small, independent hotels. These large chains generally prefer to bypass a B2B intermediary and deal directly with B2C operators, or end hotel patrons.We recognize B2B operators such as WebBeds play a vital role in the hotel booking ecosystem as a distribution channel, given the benefits to hotels. These include longer lead time bookings and lower cancelation rates than direct-to-consumer bookings, as well as negotiated net rates on hotel room allotments to B2B operators as opposed to commissions to B2C operators. Furthermore, the USD 50 billion total transaction value, or TTV, B2B market is highly fragmented and WebBeds, as the number two player in the space with a 4% share, could continue to grow strongly and generate good profitability. However, we are not confident that such profitability can be maintained beyond the next decade. This is due to the industry structure concerns discussed above and doubts about whether Webjet has any competitive differentiations, relative to peers, that can be maintained over the next decade. Future acquisitions could also become more expensive, as scale-building becomes the main game for all operators in the B2B space.Webjet OTA (about one third of forecast group midcycle EBITDA) is the number-one B2C OTA in Australia and New Zealand, commanding a 50% share of the OTA flights market, 11% of all Global Distribution Systems, or GDS, bookings, more than 5% of domestic flights market and around 4% of the international flights market (out of Australia). However, we believe competitive pressures are intense and likely to increase further longer-term. Webjet battles against established global players (such as Expedia and Booking), traditional offline travel agencies which are making concerted efforts to expand their online offerings (such as Flight Centre and Helloworld in Australia) and Metasearch websites (such as Google, Skyscanner, and Tripadvisor). All these competitors may increase their product offering or value proposition on a larger scale, leveraging off their larger customer bases, ancillary product suites, brand awareness, greater access to travel inventories and/or significantly greater financial, marketing and technological resources. Furthermore, on the flight provider side, they own and control the supply of inventory that Webjet on-sells. These airlines are using advancing technology and the internet to develop direct relationships with the end travelers (for example, direct-selling, better virtual service, more seamless integration with traveler schedules, greater provision of destination-specific information such as health or regulatory requirements). Recent reductions in commissions paid to travel agents on air tickets also highlight the continuing bargaining power of airlines, albeit some of this may be due to the pandemic-induced damage on agents' bargaining power. Consequently, we are not confident that Webjet OTA's profitability can be maintained beyond the next decade. We have doubts whether this division has any competitive advantages relative to peers that can be maintained longer-term. It is even possible that the Webjet OTA business increasingly become a pricing comparison site for consumers before they book directly with the airlines. ","We assign a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High to Webjet.The travel industry that Webjet operates in is highly cyclical and subject to external conditions such as war, terrorism, economic downturns, and natural disasters. The threat of weaker economies and pressure on discretionary spending also remains. Furthermore, as technology improves and consumer comfort and affinity for technology grow, there is potential for retail customers to engage more with direct booking for travel services instead of using an online travel agent. This would allow them to cut out the middleman and save on booking fees. In addition, travel suppliers are increasingly leveraging their own technologies to engage directly with customers In terms of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG risks, Webjet arranges travel services provided by suppliers to both businesses and customers. Instances of data mismatches, booking errors or not meeting quality expectations could lead to reputational damage. Furthermore, the group holds large volumes of booking data and sensitive customer information. This opens the company up to risks arising from data privacy or security breaches. If not managed correctly regulatory action, litigation or loss of consumer trust could ensue. We view the probability of significant and maintained breaches in these areas as less than 25%, given the firm's long history of satisfactory performance.","Our Capital Allocation rating for Webjet is Standard. The balance sheet is solid as the group conducted capital raisings to shore up its financial position during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the group had AUD 352 million in net cash on the balance sheet (excluding restricted cash), providing significant liquidity combat economic uncertainties and/or pursue acquisitions. This is especially as the group is now generating positive free cash flow.On the investments side, we rate Webjet as fair. Since the groups inception in 1998, Webjet has successfully completed six acquisitions, allowing the company to quickly add depth to its inventory and further its geographical footprint in the B2B market and breadth of the B2C offering. This is evidenced by Webjets position as globally the second-largest B2B accommodation booking provider. Funding of acquisitions has typically been through share issuances. The acquisition strategy has masked the magnitude of organic growth. However, we believe Webjets acquisition integration track record has been good.On shareholder distributions, we rate Webjet as appropriate. Given the current COVID-19-induced uncertainties on travel activities, the priority has been to conserve balance sheet. Buoyed by signs of recovery in travel activities, Webjet paid in December 2021 the interim dividend that was deferred from fiscal 2020. However, the board has not yet officially reinstated dividends which have been suspended since the second half of fiscal 2020. As conditions improve, we expect dividends to be reinstated sometime in fiscal 2023, at a payout ratio of around 50%, similar to the historical average. ","Webjet provides online travel bookings across Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. The group operates in both the business to consumer, or B2C, and business to business, or B2B, segments. The B2B business, WebBeds, acts as an intermediary between hotels and wholesale/retail travel service providers. WebBeds is currently the worlds second largest B2B accommodation booking provider despite only a circa 4% market share of the fragmented AUD 70 billion global B2B accommodation market. The companys B2C units, Webjet Online Travel Agent, or OTA, and GoSee allow retail customers to book flights, hotel accommodation, holiday packages, travel insurance, rental cars and caravans online.","Webjet is in sound financial health. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the group had AUD 352 million of net cash on the balance sheet (excluding restricted cash). The group has often relied on capital raisings as a means of maintaining its balance sheet. The group successfully completed an AUD 346 million equity raising in April 2020, further raising AUD 163 million and AUD 250 million via convertible note issue in July 2020 and April 2021, respectively. Funds were raised to provide the company with enough headroom to see through to post-pandemic recovery, pay down existing debt facilities, and allow flexibility to make further acquisitions as they arise. We believe this is sufficient liquidity for Webjet to see through any economic uncertainties, especially as the group is now generating positive free cash flow. As Webjet has seen signs of recovery, in December 2021 Webjet paid an interim dividend deferred from fiscal 2020. However, the board has not yet officially reinstated any dividend payments. As conditions improve, we expect ongoing dividends to be paid from sometime in fiscal 2025, at a payout ratio of around 50%, similar to the historical average.

24/11/2023,GE Is Rapidly Entering the Midpoint of Its Lean Transformation,General Electric Co,GE,3,24/10/2023,Joshua Aguilar,119.6,USD,23/11/2023,123.0,High,Narrow,Exemplary,B,24/10/2023,"We've lifted our fair value estimate to $123 per share from $118 following narrow-moat-rated General Electric's excellent third quarter. Results materially beat our above-FactSet-consensus expectations thanks to commercial aerospace demand. Following these results, management raised its outlook for revenue, earnings, and free cash flow. Even so, we continue to model above guidance and consensus on the strength of GE's commercial aerospace business. Commercial aerospace increased revenue nearly 29% year on year, with margin-accretive service revenue growing 31% year on year and 18% sequentially. Strong organic sales growth and favorable mix helped total aerospace margins exceed 20% for the first time in seven quarters. Commercial aerospace shows no signs of material deceleration yet. GE's total aerospace book/bill (orders divided by revenue) remains at 1.2 times, which indicates continued strong demand for commercial engines and other aero-related products and services. Furthermore, supply chain issues have started to improve, as aerospaces backlog burn rates (current revenue divided by prior-quarter backlog) have steadily moved higher on a sequential basis. Consequently, we model about $300 million more of additional aerospace operating profit. Better-than-expected working capital improvements in inventory and receivables lead us to model about $300 million more free cash flow than the top end of guidance. We now expect $5.4 billion in free cash, which implies free cash flow margins north of 8%.","Bears vastly underestimate the incremental profits GE will make from operating leverage when commercial aerospace fully recovers, as well as the windfall from the Inflation Reduction Act. GE is led by, in our view, the premier U.S. multi-industry CEO. Culp has assembled a team of leaders who are steadily changing GE's culture to one embracing lean principles. GE's installed base boasts the youngest fleet, with nearly 50% of its CFM fleet yet to make its first shop visit. This bodes well for its high-margin aftermarket business.","GE's turnaround has a lot of unknowns, including when renewables will finally reach profitability and when the Inflation Reduction Act will move toward full implementation. While GE will generate orders from the energy transition, it has consistently made negative earnings from both Power and Renewables, and new equipment orders will only pressure and dilute margins further. Bulls vastly underestimate the amount of contingent liabilities GE will have to contend with.",24/10/2023,"We believe that Larry Culp is engineering a successful turnaround of General Electric and that there's still upside in this story, particularly with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Driving GE's turnaround process is a steadfast cultural commitment to lean tools. We believe GE has line of sight to over an 8% free cash flow margin in 2023 and will reach durable double-digit free cash flow margins next year. After multiple portfolio moves, GE has reduced its debt burden by over $100 billion during Culp's tenure. We think there's an exceptional opportunity for GE to shift from debt reduction to other capital allocation options that favor the shareholder and provide the firm with strong flexibility to shift to offense. GE Aerospace remains the crown jewel of GE's portfolio. We believe that there is still some pent-up demand for air travel and that commercial aerospace revenue should overtake 2019 levels by 2024. TSA checkpoint travel figures reveal that U.S. passenger throughput is lapping 2019 levels on many days. We think GE Aerospace can recover to a 20% operating margin by 2024 while delivering incremental margins in the mid-20s over the medium term. Joint venture CFM has more narrow-bodies that are 10 years or younger than the rest of the industry, and nearly half of its CFM56 installed base has yet to see its first shop visit. While the renewables business is incurring significant losses, we believe GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik can help drive the spinoff to profitability in 2024, including breaking even in renewables by 2024. Favorable U.S. legislation provides a backdrop of more certainty around timing of wind-related projects, and a combination of better project selectivity, a focus on the North American market, and rightsizing should help drive the profits GE investors have long been clamoring for.","We assign General Electric a narrow economic moat rating based on switching costs and intangible assets stemming from its massive installed base of industrial equipment and differentiated technology. We hold off on assigning GE a wide economic moat rating because of our lack of confidence in our 20-year hurdle rate for excess return on capital.GE Aerospace meets our highest standard of a wide-moat business and is GEs crown jewel. The segment benefits from intangible assets and switching costs, and we think it is the premier commercial engine manufacturer that can deliver at scale. GE competes in a virtual duopoly in both the wide-body (twin-aisle) and narrow-body (single-aisle) space against Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney. Excluding its 50% interest in the CFM joint venture with Safran, we estimate that GE typically commands roughly half of the total commercial engine market, as measured by the installed base. The aviation segment operates on a razor-and-blade model. A GE/CFM engine is present in three of every four commercial departures. In the formative years after a new engine launch (about one third of the overall cost of a new plane), GE will typically implement an estimated 70% discount on its new narrow-body engines from their listed prices. Over time these discounts erode. A typical jet engine will first require service in about year seven of operation, at which time an engine program may pass breakeven and become a recurring and enviable profit stream for GE. These bespoke service contracts typically extend 25 years. We believe intangible assets are particularly critical for engine deliveriesthe razor in the razor-and-blade model. The technical knowledge needed to design and manufacture a jet engine is GEs main source of intangible assets. This technical know-how is supported by the firms research and development budget, of which about one third is principally funded by the U.S. government. Other intangible assets include the firms patents, long record of success, and customer relationships with both Boeing (primarily) and Airbus. A record of success can have a disproportionate impact in delivery wins.Relatedly, switching costs are strongly associated with aftermarket salesthe blade in the razor-and-blade model. GEs switching costs are a result of the firms engines and associated equipments strong integration into customers airframes and landing systems. In the United States, aircraft engine inspections are mandated and regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, and unplanned downtime related to concerns about an engines efficacy can wreak havoc for airlines in terms of time and expense. This high cost of failure ultimately increases customer loyalty. By our count, roughly 69% of GEs commercial aviation revenue stems from its services, which we believe represents strong evidence of customer reliance on GE as the original equipment manufacturer. Moreover, GEs pursuit of rate per flight hour service agreements, whereby OEMs like GE receive service payments based on flight hours, both boosts returns and solidifies switching costs. With flight hour service agreements, GE receives payments over the life of a contract. Additionally, because OEMs assume the maintenance risk, firms like GE, Pratt, and Rolls-Royce are incentivized to increase on-wing time. The Leap engine boasts an industry-leading 99.97% engine dispatch reliability rate, which equates to only one delay or cancellation every 2,500 departures. Furthermore, Leap has 6% better utilization (a value proposition of over $2 million for airline customers) and 15% better fuel burn than its CFM56 predecessor. GE Aerospace's operating margins exceed Pratts by several percentage points, which demonstrates the benefits of having a massive installed base in the aerospace industry.After GE Aerospace, GEs competitive position fares far worse, with its other businesses facing secular pressure. GE Power faces pricing pressures and a shifting energy mix in its end markets toward renewables. GE Vernova (power with renewables) is a no-moat business. While Power operates in a three-way oligopolistic market with Siemens and Mitsubishi, GE Renewable Energy competes in a more fragmented industry with other wind turbine manufacturers like Vestas, Siemens, and a host of other competitors (onshore wind revenue represents most of Renewable Energys portfolio). Moreover, while GE Power touts its 7,000-plus gas turbine installed base and the fact that it currently powers more than 30% of the worlds power, the segment has at times fallen to number three in global gas turbine orders by energy capacity.Furthermore, GE was late to realize the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, which are predicted to compete with fossil fuels subsidy-free from a levelized cost of electricity standpoint. Wind turbines dont require the same maintenance needs as gas machines, which is where GE has traditionally made money on its long-term service contracts. We think these cost dynamics threaten to obviate the competitive benefits GE derives from its massive installed base in gas turbines, particularly as renewables also offer a far more attractive and minimal carbon footprint. Under previous CEO Jeff Immelt, GE failed to appreciate these risks, and its ill-timed purchase of thermal energy provider and grid company Alstom weighed down the segments return on invested capital for years. Power was forced to continue restructuring efforts to counteract this dynamic as demand for new gas orders fell to 25-30 gigawatts from 40-45 GW articulated at the start of 2017. GE Renewable Energy suffers from many of the same competitive dynamics that plague GE Powerincluding even greater price competition to gain market share and cheaper alternatives from other forms of energy, like solarand depends heavily on production tax credits. As such, we dont believe its a business with a durable competitive advantage.","GE's principal risk is related to COVID-19 fallout on its commercial aerospace business, including government interventions and acceleration of infections that ultimately affect both revenue passenger kilometers (demand) and load factors (utilization). Additional risks include GE's significant cash burn amid pricing pressures in some of its operating businesses, including renewable energy, and its insurance liabilities (though they've been less of a concern in recent years, given rising interest rates). Finally, GE has large key-person risk in CEO Culp. Losing him before a successful turnaround would pose critical headline and fundamental risk, in our view.From an environmental, social, and governance standpoint, we think GE faces a few risks that by now are well known to investors, including government investigations into its accounting practices, shareholder lawsuits, potential embargoes from defense sales, and the impact of the global energy transition on GE's gas and steam turbine business (though GE exited its new coal build business and the energy transition mostly helps it with sales of renewables). However, we think the greatest ESG risk relates to fallout from the climate impact from aerospace engines, though we don't think this is enough to be material, and we point out that GE is developing a next-generation sustainable engine within its CFM Rise program. The firm has also teamed up with NASA to develop hybrid electric engine technology to address climate issues. Given its technology leadership, we expect GE will remain ahead of its competitors, which should ameliorate investor concerns.","We assign GE an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. Management has done an exceptional job bringing down leverage levels. We highly endorse its capital allocation decisions, particularly the focus on addressing the debt and organic investments (which offer the best returns profile), as well as the operational and cultural changes that management is driving, which we believe should meaningfully improve returns on invested capital during our forecast. We also approve of the board's $3 billion share-repurchase authorization in 2021. GE only deployed about $1 billion of share repurchases in 2022; we would have liked to have seen more deployed then.Our thesis continues to be an all-out bet on Larry Culp's leadership. Culp was CEO and president of Danaher from 2000 to 2014. Under his stewardship, Danaher's stock rose about 465% against the S&P 500's approximately 105% gain. Many financial and operational improvements are already tangible since he took the helm at GE in 2018. For example, GE has materially deleveraged the balance sheet by over $100 billion. We applaud Culp for taking decisive action, particularly in selling GE's biopharma business to his former firm Danaher for what was then a favorable price. We expect increasing flexibility for other capital allocation prioritiesmost notably organic investments through R&D and capital expenditures. Many of Culp's lean initiatives have borne fruit. For instance, in the first quarter of 2023, GE's free cash flow flipped positivethe first time it produced positive free cash flow in the first quarter since 2015. Furthermore, GE's earnings in the first half of 2023 alone have already surpassed its earnings from the prior year, when excluding GE HealthCare's contributions. We expect Culp and Vernova CEO Strazik can help bring back renewables and the broader Vernova business to profitability by the end of 2024.GE Aerospace CFO Rahul Ghai assumed the consolidated GE CFO role in September 2023, taking over from Carolina Dybeck Happe. We think GE will miss Happe's experience, which was uniquely suited to its difficult operating environment a few years ago. She brought a wealth of industrial experience, including debt reduction, working through short- and long-cycle industrials, and use of lean in operations. While much has been written about Culp's contributions, we think Happe was the perfect partner for him during a trying time. Ghai certainly has a wealth of experience, given his successful (albeit brief) tenure at Otis following its spinoff from what was then United Technologies, but we'll wait to pass judgment as he fully immerses himself with the greater responsibility.The company's financials have significantly improved thanks to the disclosures worked on by Happe and Steve Winoker and his team in investor relations. Winoker and his excellent team will continue on with GE Aerospace. We expect further improvements over time. Culp has been improving GE's culture by implementing many of the principles he took from his time at Danaher, including a laserlike focus on the customer and use of lean tools and workshops. We believe GE has moved past its prior record of poor stewardship that was anchored in the Immelt era, which included opaque accounting, overly aggressive targets, a watered-down culture that discouraged candor, and disastrous capital allocation.","GE was formed through the combination of two companies in 1892, including one with historical ties to American inventor Thomas Edison. Today, GE is a global leader in air travel and in the energy transition. The company is known for its differentiated technology and its massive industrial installed base of equipment sprawled throughout the world. That installed base most notably includes aerospace engines, gas and steam turbines, and onshore and offshore wind turbines. GE earns most of its profits on the service revenue of that equipment, which is generally higher-margin. The company is led by Danaher alumnus Larry Culp, who is leading a multiyear turnaround of the conglomerate based on lean principles.","GE has materially improved its financial health. As of year-end 2022, GE's consolidated net debt sits at $20.9 billion, while consolidated net debt/EBITDA sits at 2.4 times, in line with peers. GE's long-term bonds continue to be rated BBB+, while its short-term bonds are rated A-2.We think GE's net debt/EBITDA will fall to below 2 times by year-end 2023, which will put it below (or in better standing than) the average peer. Furthermore, GE had already reduced gross debt by over $100 billion since Culp began his tenure as CEO. Therefore, we think GE is capable of once again earning a single A credit rating. Additional debt-reduction efforts will go toward paying down bonds or preferred securities, since GE will not have to contribute further to its pension obligations until the end of the decade. GE has plenty of liquidity, including $17.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and $7.6 billion in investments, including its 1% interest in Baker Hughes (valued at $4 billion) and its 46% interest in AerCap (valued at $8.3 billion). It also holds a 19.9% interest in GE HealthCare, valued at about $6.5 billion as of Feb. 15, 2023.",GE,Industrials,133327773696.0,NYQ,4498722.0,USD,119.5999984741211,True,0,89.58411443373177,110.13216616783582,0
25/11/2023,Leading Premium NEV Manufacturer Benefiting From Consumption Upgrade Trend,NIO Inc,09866,4,30/08/2023,Vincent Sun,58.2,HKD,24/11/2023,103.0,Very High,,Standard,,30/08/2023,"Nios second-quarter revenue was at the low end of its guidance. Vehicle margins declined 10.4 percentage points year over year to 6.2% due to product mix change and promotions on older models. In addition, delivery guidance for the third quarter missed market expectations. With lower vehicle margins and rising operating expense ratios assumptions, we increase our net loss forecast for 2023-24 and delay our breakeven year forecast to 2026. We have reduced our fair value estimate to USD 13.30 per ADS (HKD 103 per share) from USD 14.00 per ADS (HKD 108 per share). Our fair value implies a forward 2024 price/sales ratio of 1.9 times. For the third quarter, management guided vehicle delivery to grow 74%-80% year over year to 55,000-57,000 units and total revenue to increase 45%-50% year over year to CNY 18.9 billion-CNY 19.5 billion. The midpoint of guidance implies monthly delivery to be around 17,500-18,000 units for August and September, which we believe is below market expectation of 20,000 units per month. Management also commented during the briefing that they expect monthly sales to pick up to at least 20,000 units in the fourth quarter with ES6, EC6, ET5, and ET5T contributing most of the volume. Despite the near-term margin pressure, we expect vehicle margin to record sequential recovery in the second half as economies of scale kick in and with the decline in battery cost. Management indicated that vehicle margin will improve to double digits in the third quarter and to around 15% in the fourth quarter. We maintain our positive view as Nio enters a strong model cycle with improving sales momentum driven by new models. Our sales and margin outlook are well supported by the further delivery ramp-up of ES6, ET5 Touring, and ES8. We believe Nios premium branding through exemplary customer service and innovative charging technologies will benefit itself from vehicle upgrade demand and differentiate from the competition.","Nio has successfully built its premium brand image, which will differentiate the company from its mass-market competitors and generate extra pricing power for the companys electric cars.  Advancing battery technology and charging solutions will ease range anxiety on electric cars. Chinese consumers soaring demand for EV cars will benefit NEV carmakers such as Nio.  Younger-generation car buyers value vehicle tech experience, giving Nio leadership compared with legacy carmakers. ","Escalating battery cost in the past one year will put Nios vehicle margin under pressure. It will derail the industry projection of cost parity of NEVs with ICEs, affecting NEV adoption in the long run.  Rising competition in the NEV market indicates legacy OEMs will defend their market share with aggressive new model launches.  Nios plan to launch a new mass-market brand will impair its premium image and dilute the companys focus on the premium NEV segment.",30/08/2023,"Nio is a leading electric vehicle, or EV, manufacturer in China, targeting the premium segment. Its current model portfolios retail prices range from CNY 328,000-CNY 656,000, with 450-700 km driving range. For new models, Nio started delivery of the midsize ET5 sedan in third-quarter 2022, priced at CNY 328,000-CNY 386,000, as well as the mid-to-large five-seater SUV ES7. The company also upgraded its first-generation SUV models ES8, ES6 and EC6 in the second quarter of 2023. It also plans to launch a new mass-market brand in 2024 to seize the robust demand while retaining Nios premium image. Nio successfully established a premium brand in the EV market. It also pioneered battery swap technology as a supplement to charging. The launch of the battery-as-a-service solution separates the battery pack from the vehicle, which cuts upfront purchase cost by 15%-30%. It targets to build over 4,000 swap stations worldwide by 2025, about 1,000 of which to be outside China. We see rapid new energy vehicle, or NEV, adoption in China, stimulated by regulatory push and improving charging infrastructure, among others. By 2025, we expect passenger NEVs to account for more than 40% of total passenger car sales. Riding on the vehicle electrification tailwind, we forecast Nios vehicle delivery to reach close to 300,000 units in 2025 from 122,486 units in 2022, taking 3% share in Chinas passenger NEV market. While it is still loss-making, we forecast improved outlook for vehicle sales profit due to increased vehicle deliveries. Our positive long-term profitability outlook in the vehicle segment leads to the first profitable year in 2026. Nio contract manufactures its vehicles at Jianghuai Automobile Group, or JACs, plants in Hefei. Under the renewed agreement, it pays JAC a fee on each vehicle produced plus a fixed total cost, which we estimate at a low-single-digit percent of Nios average selling price. Capacity expanded from 120,000 units to 240,000 units in the third quarter of 2022. Also, its new production base for the ET5 sedan at NeoPark in Hefei started production in the second half of 2022, with designed annual capacity of 120,000 units. ","While we applaud Nios success so far in establishing a premium brand in China, we think it is too early to determine whether brand loyalty will be maintained over at least a 10-year period. As such, we think Nio has no moat. Generally, we see two moat sources in the auto sector from intangible assets such as brand equity, best exemplified by Ferrari, and from cost advantage. At this stage we do not yet see either moat sources to be retained by Nio in anticipation of intensifying competition within the next 10 years. So far Nio has successfully established a premium brand image from the ground up in Chinas midrange to high-end EV market. It has invested heavily in marketing since the companys inception in 2014. Nio adopted a sophisticated branding strategy through competing in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship electric racing series. The Nio 333 FE team secured the inaugural FIA Formula E Drivers Championship in 2015. Following the successful sponsorship, Nio launched the electric supercar EP9 in 2016, which further evokes the brands premium positioning. The EP9 delivered an unprecedented performance level and broke the then existing world electric vehicle record as the fastest electric car at the Green Hell track in Germany in 2017.Riding on the luxury and high-performance brand image through Formula E sponsorship and EP9 launch, Nio released its first mass-production model ES8, a seven-seater electric SUV priced above CNY 450,000, in December 2017 and began deliveries in June 2018. The company subsequently expanded its presence by launching other popular EV models including the ES6, EC6, and ET7, and recorded significant sales growth and market share gain in Chinas premium NEV market at a price range of around CNY 350,000-CNY 600,000.The approach is similar to Teslas branding strategy of releasing its Roadster sportscar first, then expanding from high-end to the entry-level premium market. Given Nios premium positioning and price ranges of major models, we think the Nio brand is perceived by car owners as equivalent to the premium image of BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the internal combustion engine, or ICE, market.The luxury branding leads to strong pricing power. Presently, Nio cars are priced at a higher range compared with its peers. The premium pricing enables Nio to ramp up its vehicle sales margin to a level close to Li Auto. The latters extended-range electric SUV Li One is equipped with a 40.5 kWh battery versus the 75-100 kWh battery size for Nios major models.However, as the industry becomes increasingly competitive, it is still uncertain whether the premium branding that Nio has will be retained over the long run to underpin a moat. We expect significant competition coming from global established premium original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, which have strong brands. Legacy ICE manufacturing is highly competitive and capital intensive. We expect the same in the NEV market over time. In addition, the company is still burning cashwe expect it is likely to do so for at least a couple more yearsand the risk for the need to raise additional capital for capital intensive investment is high, in our view.","We have a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Nio because the company operates in a cyclical, capital-intense, and highly competitive auto manufacturing industry. These factors combined can drive huge swings in return on invested capital, even for pure-play NEV automakers. Heavy fixed costs induce fluctuating profitability from relatively small changes in demand, or from lost production due to supply shocks.Nios key threats include escalating competition in Chinas NEV market. Motivated by robust demand growth for electric vehicles, major automakers have accelerated their NEV product development in recent years. Legacy automakers, whether Chinese or global, continue to bring new electric models onto the market and compete on prices. We believe it will become increasingly challenging for Nio to increase its market share if it fails to differentiate its premium image and products from peers.The automotive industry is capital-intensive. Nio will need significant capital to ramp up production capacity, expand its sales and service network, and conduct research and development. Its future capital needs may require the company to obtain external financing through additional equity or debt issuances that may dilute existing shareholders or introduce covenants that may restrict its operations. In addition, such financing might not be available in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, which would delay its expansion plans.The NEV industry is experiencing rapid technological advances. Nio has been investing heavily on R&D efforts such as autonomous driving and intelligent operating systems. In 2019-21, R&D expenses accounted for 57%, 15% and 13% of total revenue, respectively, and we expect the expenses to remain significant. If Nio fails to achieve and commercialize these technological breakthroughs, such significant expenditure on R&D may not generate economic returns.","We have assigned a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Nio. The rating reflects our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investment and shareholder distributions. Nios balance sheet looks sound, with a reasonable level of debt in its book. The company has been in a net cash position since 2018 and we think the balance sheet would remain sound, as its access to capital is likely to remain solid amid automotive electrification tailwinds.The company has not paid out dividends historically. Given the large capital expenditure required for NEV investments, it is unlikely for dividends to be paid in the next five years. We believe this is an appropriate shareholder distribution strategy as management continues to expand sales and invest in related NEV technologies.Li Bin, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, built one of China's largest electric vehicle manufacturing enterprises from the ground up. He holds over 40% voting rights in Nio, indicating his significant vested interest in the firms long-term success. Unlike the case for many other Chinese automakers, the government does not have a direct stake in the listed entity. Such a shareholding structure enables the company to prioritize shareholder interests and be nimbler when it comes to staying on top of the competition.","Nio is a leading electric vehicle maker targeting the premium segment. Founded in November 2014, Nio designs, develops, jointly manufactures, and sells premium smart electric vehicles. The company differentiates itself through continuous technological breakthroughs and innovations such as battery swapping and autonomous driving technologies. Nio launched the first model, its ES8 seven-seater electric SUV in December 2017, and began deliveries in June 2018. Its current model portfolio includes midsize to large sedans and SUVs. It sold over 122,000 EVs in 2022, accounting for about 2% of the China passenger new energy vehicle market.","We believe Nio is in good financial health. The company employs a reasonable capital structure, with debt/capital ratio of 35.2% as of the end of 2022. The firm held CNY 23.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents against short-term loans of CNY 4.04 billion, and long-term debt of CNY 10.89 billion as of the end of 2022. Therefore, the firm should have no problem fulfilling its debt obligations and refinancing debts as they are due. Even though the automobile manufacturing business is capital-intensive, we think Nios strong cash position and improving operating cash flows allow it to expand manufacturing facilities during economic downturns through relying on some external financing.",9866.HK,Consumer Cyclical,98446065664.0,HKG,1740089.0,HKD,61.0,True,1,76.95481927710843,52.275308679646905,0
24/11/2023,Dassault Systemes' Wide Moat Would Be Hard for New Entrants to Redesign,Dassault Systemes SE,DASTY,2,25/10/2023,Julie Sharma,46.7,USD,24/11/2023,39.0,Medium,Wide,Standard,,25/10/2023,"Dassault Systmes reported results right in line with our expectationsthanks to a boost in upfront license revenue and strength in its industrial innovation software. While this quarter saw upfront license revenue strength, conversion to subscriptions is progressing at a healthy pacewhich we think will bode well in the long term, carrying a host of benefits from increased customer retention to easier upselling. The firm is still experiencing meaty foreign exchange headwinds, but with this baked in previously, management has maintained its outlook for the year. Shares are up 2% upon results and remain near our EUR 37 fair value estimate, which we reiterate for the wide-moat firm. While we believe Dassault shares are fairly valued at the moment, for investors looking to enter the moaty CAD software market, we think Autodesk is attractively priced given our $247 fair value estimate, as the firm boasts additional undervalued greenfield opportunitieslike building information modelling, or BIM. Third-quarter revenue increased by 4% year over year as reported (and 11% in constant currency), to EUR 1.42 billion. Total software revenue rose by 5% year over year as reported (and 12% in constant currency), with industrial innovation software greatly leading the pack, growing revenue by 12% year over year as reported. While we believe PTC is ahead of Dassault in cloud progress, we dont think Dassault is far behind with its cloud revenue now representing 25% of software revenue as of this quarter. Additionally, a rebound in license growth in the quarter (up by 20% year over year) stemmed from new business growth. Nonetheless, we think Dassault remains focused on the more lucrative long-term opportunity: conversions to the subscription model. Non-IFRS earnings per share in the quarter was EUR 0.28, benefiting from operating margins up 50 basis points year over year.","Dassault should see strong adoption of its 3DExperience platform, enabling margin expansion due to increasing switching costs. Dassault's foray into precision medicine by simulating individuals responses to medicine or medical devices should prove profitable over the next 10 years. The integration of Biovia with Medidata should provide significant operating leverage and competitive positioning to threaten Veevas trial management competitor.","An economic downturn triggered by COVID-19 could hinder licenses and services revenue, with software seat reduction from aircraft OEMs. The big bet on Medidata could fail to pay off if integration with Biovia is poorly accepted and Veeva proves to be a more appealing competitor. Dassault could suffer market share loss in the midmarket CAD space as cloud-only new entrant Onshape may win new business at the expense of the 3DExperience platform. ",25/10/2023,"Dassault Systmes has a hold on the computer-assisted design software market for autos, aerospace and defense, and manufacturing. With 90% of all aircraft and 80% of all autos globally made via Dassault software, we believe the company will stay well entrenched with engineering teams with help from its significant switching costs and network effect found in its midmarket CAD software, SolidWorks. In our view, the wide-moat company has adapted well to new trends in its market exposures, such as electric vehicle design software, which has made us more confident in the longevity of its moat and ability to achieve excess returns on invested capital. Outside of CAD offerings like Catia and SolidWorks, Dassault has a hefty portfolio of information intelligence, collaboration, content sharing, and simulation software, which all work to serve a part of product production, whether its drug research and development, mining planning, or clothing line organization. The most popular of these disparate offerings is Enovia, its product lifecycle management software, which is used in a variety of industries to connect engineers, marketing, and supply chain teams to better orchestrate the lifecycle of a product.  Dassault has the greatest share of the PLM market, and this exposure is responsible for nearly half of the company's $100 billion addressable market. While there are new entrants in the PLM and midmarket CAD spaces, we think that Dassault will be able to work to minimize any additional share that new players would take in its markets by increasing its adoption of its 3DExperience platform. The platform seeks to connect much of Dassault's offerings in one place. We think that over the next two years, Dassault will be able to significantly increase its platform revenue. With a greater portion of customers on the platform, we would not be surprised to see customer churn come down and switching costs increase as the platform helps to lock in the benefits of using all Dassault software, which used to be more disparate.","We think Dassault Systmes merits a wide moat because of its significant switching costs founded on the functions it serves in highly mission-critical industries, such as automotive and aerospace and defense, as well as the learning curve required to be adept at using its software. Churn rates support our belief that the company has strong switching costs. The company quotes churn relatively in line with the industry and customer type: less than 3% for its overall business, excluding small customers, which have churn near 10%, in line with typical small-business churn rates. While we think that several of Dassault's offerings benefit from a substantial network effect, because these offerings compose less than a majority of the company's business, we fail to assign a network effect to Dassault's overall moat sources.Of Dassault's software offerings, Catia is the largest contributor of revenue (27%), with SolidWorks (20%) and Enovia (9%) following. Catia is high-end computer-assisted design software. While customers often mix and match CAD software, this is often the case among low-, mid- and high-end CAD software rather than mixing software from one tier, such as having both Catia and rival PTC's high-end offering, Creo. Still, we think that between Catia and Creo there is significant nuance to why a company has selected one or the other as its high-end CAD provider. For example, Catia is often preferred for sheet metal and surfacing work, whereas Creo is often the preference in designing complex structures and piping design. While both software programs possess each other's capabilities, we think that how a company prioritizes features like piping design versus surfacing work defines why it selects one high-end piece of software over the other. Because of these priorities related to mission-critical product functions reflected in the choice to use Catia, we think that Catia exhibits high switching costs. While we suspect that the quality in these design functions is merging between Catia and its top competitors, we think that switching costs are strengthened by the learning curve of the software. Changing an engineering team to a Creo team from a Catia team would involve significant retraining and pose significant risks. To paint a picture, in 2006, production of Airbus' A380 aircraft failed and cost the company $6 billion. Partnering DaimlerChrysler aerospace engineers worked with different design software than that of Airbus engineers, leading to copper and aluminum wiring for the plane being too short as a result of the different software programs calculating wire bend radii differently. Due to the risks a software switch entails in mission-critical functions, we think theres much inertia in remaining a Catia shop. We do not think Catia exhibits a strong network effect, given that the CAD software is more specialized than the average product design and product lifecycle offerings. Considering the size of the high-end CAD market for product design, we think the benefits of CAD software being taught in graduate programs are less in comparison to midmarket software. Because of the lack of a network effect, companies often require extensive training when orienting new hires rather than expecting new graduates to already be trained on their software of choice. We think that software programs like Autodesk's Inventor or Dassault's SolidWorks have a more expansive university presence, given that they specialize in meeting midmarket CAD needs, which makes up the majority of the CAD market.SolidWorks is a midmarket CAD offering. It benefits from a significant network effect, in our view, given the extent to which it's taught in engineering programs worldwide, similar to Autodesk's strong network effect propelled by its presence in the top architecture and construction programs. In fact, Dassault says SolidWorks is used in more than 80% of the world's top engineering universities and 31,000 schools worldwide. In the overall global CAD market, which includes CAD for product design, architecture and more, we estimate SolidWorks has the second-largest share after Autodesk (which we estimate at 30%), at nearly 25%. However, given Autodesk's strength in building and construction versus SolidWorks' specialty in product design, we think it's fair to assume that SolidWorks dominates design in product engineering over Autodesk. We consider the adoption of SolidWorks within universities to make the software more attractive to employers, and as more and more employers deploy SolidWorks, it becomes more attractive to more and more students and universities thereafter. With SolidWorks being considered the industry standard for many of its solutions, specifically within product manufacturing, universities are convinced to continue teaching the software in its programs, which drives firms to continue using this industry standard, causing universities to continue to teach the software in their technical curriculums. We also think that, like Catia, moving from an alternative midmarket CAD software is arduous, which we think leads to significant switching costs for SolidWorks. We also consider switching costs to be significant given the length of time required to master SolidWorks. We estimate that learning the basics of SolidWorks is similar to Autodesks AutoCAD at about three to six months, with ""expert"" status coming near the three-year mark. The rest of Dassault's revenue comes from a slew of other software offerings in the 3D modeling application family (with Catia and SolidWorks) as well as three other product families: content and simulation, social and collaborative, and information intelligence. Simulia is an example of a content and simulation application, which is a product for simulation of factors like electromagnetics, fluids, materials, structures, and vibro acoustics behavior. Exalead is an example of a Dassault information intelligence offering, which uses artificial intelligence services to bring about efficiencies in engineering and manufacturing, such as automatically classifying product parts for use. We think that all of these diversified Dassault offerings also exhibit switching costs, given the significant implementation costs required to change simulation providers, for example. We also think that because these other offerings are still complex, a significant learning curve exists.","We believe Dassault Systmes exhibits medium uncertainty. We do not foresee any material environmental, social, or governance issues on the horizon. We think that in the case of an economic downturn, Dassault is slightly less well off than its other CAD peers, like Autodesk and PTC, due to its lower percentage of recurring revenue at 72%. As a result, we think nonrecurring revenue, which includes licenses, is more likely to ebb with a recession.Specific to Dassault's exposed industries, we think there are risks in its CAD software playing an integral part in production of highly mission-critical objects, like aircraft and autos. For instance, if a simulation were to predict erroneous results, leading to a number of faulty aircraft or autos to be produced, we think Dassault's reputation could greatly suffer. We think the same applies to Dassault's exposure to life sciences. If materials science interactions predicted in Dassault software prove faulty, animal or human testing of a drug could imply serious results and longer drug cycle times. Finally, in light of COVID-19, Dassault faces risks associated with its exposure to the airline industry, given the significant potential that these customers (like Boeing and Airbus) could go bankrupt. However, we think that even in such cases, Dassault subscriptions will be paid, since the software is crucial to aircraft OEM operations. There is a risk that fewer seats on these subscriptions are sold if such OEMs decided to release fewer aircraft models than normal. However, we dont believe that sheer volume of aircraft sold would affect software seats, given that the engineering needs of aircraft OEM are primarily a function of outright models.","We consider Dassault Systmes' Capital Allocation Rating to be Standard, based on our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investments, and mixed shareholder distributions.We consider the company to have a sound balance sheet. As of 2022, Dassault had EUR 2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It had EUR 3 billion in total debt, much of which is a result of debt financing required to purchase Medidata for $5.7 billion in 2019. We think debt/EBITDA will decrease to under 1 by 2025 from 1.6 in 2022.Management has showcased strong investments, in our view. The Dassault family is the largest shareholder, owning 40% of Dassault Systmes. The head of the family, Serge Dassault, died in 2018. While this brings about some uncertainty in the ability to be immune to a hostile takeover, the company has stressed that there are no clear signs of the family wanting to sell off shares anytime soon. We think the company is in good hands with CEO Bernard Charls, who has held the executive position since 1995. Over the last six years, Dassault Systmes has invested proportionally more of its capital in acquisitions. It has expanded increasingly into the healthcare industry with its acquisition of Medidata for $5.8 billion in 2019. While we think the acquisition has substantial synergies with the companys existing life sciences platform, Biovia, we do think that extracting these will take several years. We consider this acquisition as well to be anomalous in its size, and therefore do not expect future acquisitions to take a significant toll on the companys ability to expand shareholder wealth.Considering shareholder distributions, over the next 10 years, we expect Dassault Systmes to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 30%, which it has maintained over the last five years. We also forecast the company to continue to do share repurchases at anywhere from $50 million to $300 million per year. However, because this could result in overpaying for shares, we rate shareholder distributions as mixed.","Dassault Systmes is a leading provider of computer-assisted design and product lifecycle management software, serving customers like Boeing and Tesla throughout the production process. The companys top line largely depends on the transportation and mobility, industrial equipment, and aerospace and defense industries.","We consider Dassault Systmes to be financially healthy, given its asset-light model. As of 2022, Dassault had EUR 2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company had EUR 3 billion in total debt, much of which is a result of debt financing required to purchase Medidata for $5.7 billion in 2019. We think debt/EBITDA will decrease to under 1 by 2025 from 1.6 in 2022. Even with significant debt to pay down, Dassault should be well equipped to generate healthy free cash flow. We expect the firm to continue paying out an annual dividend (with a roughly 30% payout ratio) and continue decent share repurchases.",DASTY,Technology,62471573504.0,PNK,27224.0,USD,46.70000076293945,True,0,40.02423544491059,47.56829271083781,0

The earnings growth outlook for the industry is brightening as the developers largest businessoffice leasing in Tokyoappears to be reaching a cyclical turning point, while some secondary businesses such as hotel management are benefiting from a boom in inbound tourism into Japan. Meanwhile, the developers large office projects overseasMitsui Fudosans two Hudson Yards towers in Manhattan that opened in 2018 and 2022 and Mitsubishi Estates recently completed 8 Bishopsgate tower in the City of Londonseem to be faring well in the postpandemic leasing environment despite the global work-from-home trend. Ongoing rises in construction costs in Japan have mixed effects, threatening to potentially reduce the profitability of future condo sales (which have done well until now as selling prices have risen robustly, particularly in central Tokyo) but at the same time potentially improving the supply/demand balance of new offices. Among the three developers, Mitsui benefits most from the growth in inbound tourism, owing to its greater weight of retail leasing, hotels, and entertainment businesses. Hotels and the Tokyo Dome stadium are now forecast to contribute 6% of this years operating profit, up from Mitsuis original guidance of 4%. Sumitomo Realty benefits most if the Tokyo office rents start to rise due to its greater weight of office leasing and its less-prime locations than those of Mitsui and Mitsubishi Estate. Mitsubishi Estate is somewhat underperforming Mitsui and Sumitomo Realty, in part due to its closures of two older buildings in Yurakucho for redevelopment, but we still expect it to benefit from inbound tourism growth and marketwide improvement in Tokyo office leasing.","Mitsubishi Estate's long-term plan released in early 2020 promises a more efficient use of assets with capital gains progressively booked on disposals, such as the sale of part of the building housing its headquarters to Norway's sovereign-wealth fund. Mitsubishi Estate owns the largest block of land plots in Tokyo's most prime office district, which continues to attract brand-name tenants and has low vacancy rates. With a growing retail and hotel portfolio, Mitsubishi Estate should benefit from the robust postpandemic growth in inbound tourism.","Mitsubishi Estates historical valuation premium to other major Japanese real estate developers seems increasingly hard to justify now that Mitsui Fudosan has surpassed it in scale. Even if Marunouchi retains its overall competitiveness vis--vis other office districts in Tokyo, its dependence on traditional Japan Inc. corporations rather than newer companies could affect its rent premium. The Yurakucho and Tokyo Torch projects scheduled for completion in the mid and late 2020s could be too large for the market if demand shifts permanently after the coronavirus pandemic.",20/11/2023,"Mitsubishi Estate owns most of the land in the prime office area in front of Tokyo Station (Otemachi, Marunouchi, and Yurakucho), much of which acquired from the government in 1890 with few transactions since. Leasing office space in these districts continues to generate most of the firm's profit today, though Mitsubishi Estate has expanded into retail and residential leasing, condo development, hotels, and related businesses. More than 20% of profit comes from overseas, a proportion it aims to bring up to 30% by 2030. The firm had just launched a 10-year long-term plan in early 2020 right before the coronavirus pandemic hit, in which it envisioned growth in the first half of the decade to be driven by overseas, including expansion in Southeast Asia, followed by growth in the decade's second half driven by office expansion at home with the opening of Japan's tallest skyscraper just north of Tokyo station and redevelopment of Yurakucho. The plan called for total investment of about JPY 600 billion to JPY 700 billion in these areas surrounding its core Marunouchi district (Yurakucho, Uchikanda and Tokiwabashi) in order to boost annual net operating profit by JPY 60 billion.  However, the pandemic and the work-from-home trend have changed some aspects of these plans. Overseas, the company has shifted more of its investment focus to developed markets such as the U.S. and U.K. rather than taking outsize bets on emerging markets in Asia. In Japan, plans to build the huge Tokyo Torch Tower to the north of Tokyo station remain on track for completion five years from now, but we think plans to redevelop Yurakucho will be reworked to try to meet new needs of society as working styles change. Mitsubishi Estate has increased shareholder-friendly moves in recent years, such as beginning share buybacks in 2019, as well as engaging in some rare sales of property stakes in its superprime core area west of Tokyo station to improve capital efficiency. To meet the return on equity goals in its 10-year plan, we believe Mitsubishi Estate will continue to increase shareholder returns and further control balance sheet efficiency. ","We do not believe Mitsubishi Estate has an economic moat. The primary moat source for real estate companies is efficient scale where the market is of a limited size efficiently served by a small number of firms. Although we believe Mitsubishi Estate has efficient scale within the Marunouchi CBD, Tokyo as a whole lacks strong geographical or regulatory barriers to development, and the Marunouchi cachet appears not to be strong enough for Mitsubishi Estate to demand rent levels that would allow it to earn above its cost of capital. There are areas adjacent to Marunouchi that similarly appeal to large Japanese corporations for their headquarters and other top office space, such as the east side of Tokyo station and Hibiya to the south of Marunouchi, both of which are seeing high levels of investment from rival developers. Even areas further afield attract numerous high-profile tenants, such as investment banks near Roppongi and internet firms near Shibuya. Furthermore, the opening of a new station on the circular Yamanote Line in front of a 13-hectare development by JR East could attract more businesses south to Shinagawa, especially after the super-high-speed maglev to Nagoya opens after 2027, as many business travelers may depart and arrive in Shinagawa rather than Tokyo Station. We see the Yaesu side of Tokyo Station including Nihonbashi as a greater threat to Mitsubishi Estate than Shinagawa in the near term, as some Marunouchi tenants could choose to move to new buildings when rivals complete them. However, we think the Yaesu side of Tokyo Station is close enough to Marunouchi that the positive effects could be just as large as negative effects, allowing both districts together to better compete with other potential competing areas in Tokyo.","The Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Mitsubishi Estate is Medium. Although there is risk of secular destruction of demand for office leasing as employers looking to trim costs elect to make more use of the work-from-home option, on a cyclical basis we think the recurring nature of leases limits short-term volatility from ups and downs. In the past 15 years, Mitsubishi Estates earnings have been slightly more volatile than those of its peers Mitsui Fudosan and Sumitomo Realty, reflecting a similar degree of revenue variability combined with somewhat higher operating leverage, but the company remained profitable even in fiscal 2009 when it reported an annual ROE of 1.0%. Mitsubishi Estate has significant geographical concentration in the Marunouchi/Otemachi area directly west of Tokyo station, with around half of its total owned leasable space located in the district and a similar proportion of total company operating profits coming from it, per our estimates. The area is the most prestigious in Japan for large corporate tenants and is a strength for Mitsubishi Estate, but the concentration also poses a risk if there were to be a disaster specifically affecting this area, or if alternative business districts gain popularity at Marunouchis expense. We believe Mitsubishi Estate's environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks are moderate and do not reach the extent where these risks alone would prompt us to raise our Uncertainty Rating to High if we had not already assigned a High rating for our reasons related to its business.","We assign Mitsubishi Estate a Capital Allocation Rating of Standard. As mentioned in the Financial Strength section, we view its balance sheet strength as more than sound enough for its level of business risk. Rather than wanting it to increase financial leverage and risk, however, we would like the company to look at its assets with a stricter eye and to become more aggressive about disposing of marginal properties, either selling them off entirely or alternatively selling a stake if the company sees a strategic reason to maintain partial ownership in a property whose financial returns are not particularly high. We think Mitsubishi Estate's historical approach to investments was rather poor, but that it has improved in recent years to fair. For example, Mitsubishi Estate in early 2020 sold off 40% of its headquarters building to the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. In terms of selling off lower-efficiency properties and either plowing the cash into new higher-return projects or into increased shareholder returns, we think Mitsubishi Estate is slightly behind Mitsui Fudosan but is nonetheless improving. Its 10-year plan released in early 2020 offers commitment to become more efficient in its approach to assets and investments and to steadily increase shareholder returns. Mitsubishi Estate holds around JPY 380 billion in investment securities, of which 1% stakes in trading company Mitsubishi Corp. and insurance company Tokio Marine account for close to half of the total in terms of value.Mitsubishi Estates dividend payout ratio has risen over the past decade from around 25% to slightly above 30%. After announcing its first-ever share buyback of JPY 100 billion, close to 4% of shares outstanding, in 2019, Mitsubishi Estate launched its second share buyback of JPY 30 billion in 2021 and a third buyback of JPY 100 billion at the end of 2022 that it just completed. Going forward, we project that it buys back more than 2% of its shares annually on average (JPY 50 billion in the current year, gradually rising thereafter).","Mitsubishi Estate is one of the three big Japanese real estate companies. Around two thirds of its operating profit comes from leasing office space in Japan, where half of its portfolio is concentrated in the prime Marunouchi/Otemachi district between Tokyo station and the Imperial Palace. Mitsubishi Estates predecessor originally bought this land from the government in 1890, and the company sees itself as steward of the showcase areas long-term development, rarely if ever selling any properties there. ","Mitsubishi Estates ratio of interest-bearing debt to equity is 1.30 times based on the book value of its properties, but only 0.62 times based on its reported market value of properties assuming a 30% tax rate on unrealized gains. It has single-A credit ratings from Moodys and Standard & Poors and double-A ratings from Japanese domestic agencies. Just over 50% of Mitsubishi Estates debt has at least five years until it rolls over, and 87% is at fixed interest rates More than one third of total funding is sourced in financial markets via bond issuance, a higher proportion than is the case for Mitsui Fudosan and Sumitomo Realty. This includes JPY 250 billion in 60-year bonds maturing in 2076, JPY 40 billion maturing in the late 2050s, and JPY 80 billion maturing in the 2030s. Comparing Mitsubishi Estate's financial leverage with that of its peers, interest-bearing debt is currently around 57% of enterprise value, lower than Mitsui Fudosan's 59% and Sumitomo Realty's 67%. Given the stability of its assets in Marunouchi and its long-term debt maturity profile, we think Mitsubishi Estate could afford to increase its financial leverage somewhat as a way to improve returns on equity.",8802.T,Real Estate,2521912836096.0,JPX,3418700.0,JPY,1970.5,True,0,1876.16654112281,2115.845182394679,1
24/11/2023,Robust Third-Quarter Production but Into Softening Lithium Prices,Mineral Resources Ltd,MIN,3,26/10/2023,Mark Taylor,64.02,AUD,24/11/2023,67.0,High,,Standard,,26/10/2023,"Our AUD 67 per share fair value estimate for no-moat Mineral Resources stands. The iron ore and lithium miner has left all fiscal 2024 volume guidance unchanged following release of fiscal first-quarter operational results. That unmoved guidance includes 16.5-18.8 million tons of iron ore production and 360-440 kilotons of 6% lithium equivalent spodumene, increases of zero and 20% respectively at the midpoint versus fiscal 2023. Mining services volumes are guided to 260-280 million tons, up 5%-13% against 248 million tonnes in fiscal 2023. We remain at the guidance midpoint for all categories. Despite this we lower our fiscal 2024 EPS forecast by 20% to AUD 4.85. But that fall, predicated on reduced lithium price expectations, is not sufficiently material to move the fair value needle. Earnings swing violently on iron ore and lithium price realization, and high-cost iron ore operations. Our lithium carbonate price forecast for fiscal 2024 is 20% reduced to USD 35,735 per metric ton, chiefly a function of the softened spot price. The spot price on Oct. 20 stood at just USD 23,000 per metric ton, down materially against an average price for the June 2023 quarter nearer USD 45,000. We remain more optimistic than many in the market, still anticipating a lithium price rebound as strong demand growth outpaces supply, leading to a supply deficit in 2024. We posit rising EV adoption, and the increasing buildout of energy storage systems will keep lithium demand growing to surpass 1 million metric tons in 2024, from 800,000 in 2022, eventually hitting 2.5 million metric tons by 2030. And while we see rising supply, we think enough projects will face delays to keep a market deficit as demand grows. While we expect prices will remain volatile, we think a market deficit will generally keep prices above the marginal cost of production of USD 20,000 per metric ton on an all-in-sustaining cost basis. ","Mineral Resources grew strongly since listing in 2006. The chairman and managing director have been with the business for over a decade and have meaningful shareholdings. Australian iron ore is mainly purchased by Chinese steel producers, meaning Mineral Resources offers leveraged exposure to Chinese economic growth. Mineral Resources has a recurring base of revenue and earnings from processing infrastructure.","Mineral Resources' profits are exposed to volatile iron ore price. We expect future iron ore prices to be much less favorable than the decade-long boom to 2014. Investments developing lithium bear fruit now in a booming market, but a strong third-party supply response into a small market risks hollowing out returns. Mineral Resources has poor geographic diversification, with a high dependence on capital activity in Western Australia. Mineral Resources is highly dependent on likely Chinese demand for iron ore.",26/10/2023,"Mineral Resources grew significantly following listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2006. Demand for crushing and screening services grew strongly with iron ore output from the major Western Australian iron ore miners. Cost inflation encouraged large mining companies to outsource capital-intensive, lower-returning processes. Mineral Resources also rapidly expanded its own iron ore mining business, though lacking the integrated rail and port infrastructure of major competitors and at a competitive disadvantage. More recent diversification into lithium production at Mt Marion and the Wodgina mine has persistent earnings momentum. The financial record to now is impressive and the balance sheet is unleveraged. Mineral Resources has diversified its earnings streams and improved financial disclosure. In fiscal 2010, the company was a mining service provider and minerals producer as now. But disclosure extended to just iron ore production tonnage, and segment earnings. Mining Services and Processing contributed 96% of group EBIT. Step forward to fiscal 2020 and Mineral Resources has materially improved its level of financial disclosure, and the greater depth of clients and number of project sites also reduces risk. We think the business model is demonstrably maintainable. The volume-linked crushing and screening business should be somewhat more resilient to commodity price weakness. Mineral Resources' mining services business builds, owns, and operates crushing and screening plants on behalf of mining customers. Despite contributing only 40% of group EBIT, Mining Services is core. Twelve 5 to 15 million metric ton per year crushing and screening plants are owned and operated on 12 sites. Clients substantially include the largest mining companies and contract books have been renewed over time leading to volume growth. Power is supplied by mining companies and margins are comparatively stable. Bolstering growth in the core business centered on mining services around Australian bulk commodities, Mineral Resources will selectively own and develop its own mining operations, with the aim of subsequent sell-down while retaining core processing and screening rights. ","Mineral Resources has no economic moat. Return on invested capital averaged about 12.5% for the five years to end fiscal 2019, well above the cost of capital. This is an excellent outcome with the company paying out more in dividends than the value of its invested capital base. However, returns have been elevated by abnormally favorable iron ore prices. Mineral Resources' iron ore mining business does not have a competitive advantage relative to the majors in BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Vale, which move vast amounts of iron ore over large and efficient infrastructure networks, enabling very low production costs. Mineral Resources is a relatively high-cost producer, and its iron ore operations have the potential to be a drag on future returns. The company in the past has said it may exit iron ore mining, though commitment has been renewed of late.Growing lithium production in support of growing EV markets is favorable diversification but comes with its own unique risks, not least around pricing. Australia's hard-rock lithium mines are not low-cost, with enviable competition coming from brines which account for 87% of lithium production globally. The likes of Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile was recently approved to increase its production tonnage from the lowest-cost source of lithium globally, Salar de Atacama, by roughly 7-8 times through 2030. The counter to this is that hard-rock operations like Mineral Resources' Wodgina,can be expected to operate in the lowest cost quartile for spodumene globally. Spodumene is an important source of lithium which is extracted by fusing in acid. It is a higher-cost source of lithium than brines, but is a low-cost source of lithium hydroxide, important for batteries, because lithium hydroxide can be produced directly from spodumene, while brines must produce lithium carbonate first. Mineral Resources' crushing and screening business is superior to its iron ore business, as it owns fixed plant and equipment at customers' mines, which is important in the production of iron ore. Mining companies could replicate the assets, or threaten to as a lever to push down contract crushing rates. But we think the business model is demonstrably maintainable. Loss of a contract is unlikely given the plant is integrated within the clients process, and as a specialist, Mineral Resources is the low-cost solution. And Mineral Resources' plants can be completely moved to new sites so invested capital would not be lost even were this unlikely event to happen.A concern wed harbored previously was that Mineral Resources crushing and screening plants could be held to ransom if a mining company decided to move the process in-house. But its plants can be completely moved to new sites so invested capital would not necessarily be lost even were this to happen. Loss of a contract is unlikely given the plant is integrated within the clients process, and as a specialist, Mineral Resources is the low-cost solution. We think this indicative of a maintainable business model.Further bolstering growth in the core business centered on mining services around Australian bulk commodities, Mineral Resources will selectively own and develop its own mining operations, with the aim of subsequent sell-down while retaining core processing and screening rights. This can see the mining earnings over-shadow services at times, exacerbated by commodity price swings. But mining services remains core. Mining contributed around 30% of EBIT in fiscal 2014, and near negligible earnings in fiscal 2015, but had grown to the majority 60% of EBIT contribution in first-half fiscal 2020. It would have been substantially more if not for 60% sell-down of Wodgina lithium mining assets to Albemarle in late 2019 for USD 1.3 billion--a highly successful example of the build-sell-run approach.Mineral Resources and Albemarle now jointly manage Wodgina, though Mineral Resources retains the build, own, operate crushing contract and the mine to ship haulage contract, in accordance with its overarching business strategy--that being to acquire ownership/joint ownership of undeveloped ore bodies, fund the mine design and development and secure the life-of-mine contract for full pit-to-end customer services.The Wodgina JV is expected to produce up to 750Ktpa of 6% spodumene concentrate, which is ultimately intended to be used as feedstock for a company-owned lithium hydroxide plant. A lithium hydroxide plant could produce at a rate of 100ktpa though coming at an estimated cost in the vicinity of AUD 800 million. But as part of its Wodgina buy-in Albemarle also assigned Mineral Resources 40% of two 25,000 metric ton per year lithium hydroxide conversion units currently being built by it in Kemerton.Wodgina is expected to operate in the lowest-cost quartile for spodumene globally. Spodumene is an important source of lithium which is extracted by fusing in acid. It is a higher-cost source of lithium than brines, but is a low-cost source of lithium hydroxide, appropriate for batteries, because lithium hydroxide can be produced directly from spodumene. Brines must produce lithium carbonate first. Brines account for approximately 87% of global lithium production. ","We ascribe a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Mineral Resources. Its earnings are dependent upon volatile lithium and iron ore prices, both directly via sales and indirectly via the provision of services to lithium and iron ore mining companies. Its own iron ore production is high cost and highly leveraged to the iron ore price, which we expect to be less favorable in future in contrast to recent boom prices. The crushing services business is less sensitive to commodity price movements in the short term, but weaker prices could reduce demand for services in the longer term and could see mining companies look to share margin pain with contractors such as Mineral Resources. The iron ore crushing business also faces the risk that lower capital costs could encourage mining customers to in-source services.Material ESG exposures create additional risk for investors in mining services businesses like Mineral Resources. These ESG risks are based largely on industry risks that are already incorporated into our base-case analysis. We incorporate a 13.5% cost of equity assumption in our discounted cash flow-based fair value estimate for Mineral Resources.The most significant ESG risks relate to resource use and emissions, effluent and waste. As a miner, Mineral Resources exposure to resource use issues is unsurprisingly high. And the use of excavators, explosives, drills and other heavy machinery at mine sites produces SOx, NOx, dust, particulate matter, noise and vibrations, not to mention carbon emissions. While exposure is high, it is similar to the subindustry exposure more generally.Mineral Resources also wears risk with regard to community relations and corporate governance. The significant environmental and economic impacts of mines and mine development generates significant community scrutiny which must be navigated with care. And the quality and integrity of Mineral Resources board and management and its remuneration systems are governance areas of focus. ","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Mineral Resources is Standard.Mineral Resources is in reasonable financial health. Net operating cash flow jumped to AUD 1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 from essentially zero in fiscal 2022, ahead of our expectations with 100% cash conversion. Despite this, net debt more than doubled to AUD 1.9 billion on heavy capital expenditure including for Onslow. Yet gearing remains conservative, net debt/EBITDA being 1.1 at the end of June 2023, and likely to fall even including Onslow. However, debt levels need to be watched given lithium and iron ore prices can be volatile. The first material principal repayment isnt due until fiscal 2027. The current circumstance is unusual and a more usual position is Mineral Resources operating with little to no net debt including for the eight years to fiscal 2018; a sensible position for a company operating in the volatile mining services space. On the investment side, we rate Mineral Resources performance as exceptional. Including goodwill, returns on invested capital averaged in the high double digits for the past 10 years, well ahead of our assessed 11.5% WACC. Mineral Resources' mining services business builds, owns, and operates crushing and screening plants on behalf of mining customers. Despite contributing only 40% of group EBIT, Mining Services is core. Bolstering growth in the core business centered on mining services around Australian bulk commodities, Mineral Resources will selectively own and develop its own mining operations, with the aim of subsequent sell-down while retaining core processing and screening rights. The company has generated impressive profits on these sell-downs, including on lithium mines. Going forward we expect Mineral Resources ROICs to continue to comfortably exceed WACC. Finally, distributions are mixed. Mineral Resources has paid out a comparatively low 0%-50% of underlying earnings. Its hard to complain given exceptional capital appreciation on high returns and the fact that mining companies often pay little in the way of dividends. But particularly with net debt now expunged, we think a somewhat higher payout ratio in order.","Mineral Resources listed on the ASX in 2006 following the merger of three mining services businesses. The subsidiary companies were previously owned by managing director Chris Ellison, who remains a large shareholder despite selling down. Operations include iron ore and lithium mining, iron ore crushing and screening services for third parties, and engineering and construction for mining companies. Mining and contracting activity is focused in Western Australia. ","Mineral Resources is in reasonable financial health. Net operating cash flow jumped to AUD 1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 from essentially zero in fiscal 2022, ahead of our expectations with 100% cash conversion.

25/11/2023,"Ageas Has Good Partnerships, but No Clear Strategic Direction Conveyed To Investors",Ageas SA/ NV,AGS,3,30/08/2023,Henry Heathfield,39.71,EUR,23/11/2023,37.0,Medium,,Standard,,30/08/2023,"Ageas has reported average results for the first six months of the year. Management reiterates a target for a net operating result of between EUR 1.1 billion and EUR 1.2 billion for the full year. The operating free capital the business has generated over the last six months is EUR 492 million. As a result, management has announced the payment of a EUR 1.5 interim dividend per share, equal to around EUR 275 million. Ageas reiterated an average growth rate of 6% to 10% for its dividends per share. The business has managed to increase its inflows by around 6 percentage points at constant exchange rates to around EUR 9.3 billion and this growth in life inflows has mainly been driven by higher sales in China in particular as the business has sought to position itself ahead of a change in the guaranteed rate of return. However, the detailed picture is messy. Life inflows in China, India, Thailand, and Turkey have been strong, but there have been sizable outflows in nearly all other regions. Nonlife inflows have been more balanced and are generally positive across all countries. However, given the size of the life business versus nonlife, this has led to a drop in operating profit across all regions. Margins are under pressure as the life guaranteed margin has fallen by close to 50 basis points to 1.16%, approaching low levels historically. The nonlife combined ratio has improved by close to 2 percentage points to 93.3% because of the benign weather of this first interim. The solvency position of Ageas improved by 2 percentage points to 220%, above the 175% target. We maintain our EUR 37 fair value estimate and our no moat rating.","We have a sense that operationally this is not such a bad business. However, there is little disclosure about operations. In Asia Ageas seems to go from strength to strength. Even now that it is investing more here, we are hesitant on Chinese reinsurance allocation. By and large a decent looking fixed-income portfolio. However, we are a lot less keen on the level of unsecured loans.","Ageas is more leveraged than most. On top of the leverage sits the relative performance note, and this introduces further volatility into Ageas' earnings. While Ageas appears to be a dominant domestic force, from the inflows we feel there isnt enough of the move to unit-linked. Also, this seems like a highly individual orientated portfolio. We would prefer to see more focus on group life.",30/08/2023,"We think Ageas is lacking a clear direction and proven strategy. Ageas is present in Belgium, U.K., continental Europe, and Asia as well as running its own reinsurance operation. Tack on to that the importance of the business asset management, you are essentially left with a business that has six divisions. This is simply too many in our view. Insurance is a complex set of products and the historical approach has been one of diversification. However, what we frequently see within primary insurers and in particular multilines, with increasing diversification these businesses can lack specific expertise and master none. We understand that this approach to diversification is highly important in the reinsurance business. With exposure to large and lumpy losses these businesses will want to ensure that during those times they have more steady and reliable sources of income. But for primary insurers much of this tail risk is indemnified and this leaves managerial attention a crucial input for shareholder outcomes. What we tend to find within this and in particular in smaller multilines, is this diversification leads to a dilution of expertise and thus reduces firms' dominance in their chosen fields. We have already started to see this strategy of greater diversification unwind. For example, at least one peer has been separated into three distinct geographical businesses that focus purely on life insurance products that are most relevant in each of these locales. Given the strength of the management team and dominance of the respective primary product in each of these regions, we do think that in the long term this strategy will be one that prevails. Another peer is a company that has long-lost the investment community on its strategic direction and rationale. This business is now focusing on just three markets and has also started to trim its portfolio to one that focuses on the accumulation side. Another business has suffered from the diversification cloud. However, it is now only focusing on three end-markets with force; this has been well received via shareholder distributions. We urge Ageas to take a similar stand.","We do not assign Ageas an economic moat.Communication with shareholders is a problem for the firm. While its home market of Belgium accounts for around two thirds of net profit delivered to shareholders in a normal year, we don't hear anything about this domestic business nor the how or why its operations are run. Asia is the growth engine, yet with these regions built on partnerships our only read is the end-share of profit for shareholders. Strategies conveyed in investor days are elusive and focus purely on financials. Beyond that, Ageas is looking to grow its protection share, that being term life, accident, critical illness, and disability among others, in China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Turkey life being targets; markets like Vietnam, Belgium Life, and Portugal Life offer additional potential in this product group. We know little of how Ageas intends to achieve its targets. We know Ageas believes digital platforms will be digital enablers for protection and health insurance. This we understand because it is difficult to sell savings products without advice. However, there is a severe lack of how any of this will be achieved and at a base level how good and what these digital platforms are.The contribution from Asia is growing and given this market is more nascent and the demographics, we imagine this is the primary focus for Ageas. Returns on equity are improving for shareholders and we believe it is most likely the sales of health and protection products in Asia through its partnerships are helping with this. However, with the result of nonconsolidated partnerships being volatile, we are unsure what is going on in these locales. We know Ageas is looking to improve financial disclosures here. But as far as were concerned the sooner the better, so it can provide investors with some insight into these operations. More insight into its operations in Belgium and continental Europe is also needed, rather than skirting around the issue with only high-level comments.","We assign Ageas a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium.Ageass financial disclosures are not good and this leads to low transparency of its Asia operations. Further, it makes it difficult to assess the operational strength of the business. We don't believe the management team has laid out a clear strategy and while the financial targets are clear, we think there is little detail on how these will be achieved. We then overlay that with the history of this business and structure with its emergence from Fortis, which has been convoluted, and we still think there is a wide margin for volatile earnings. The remaining relative performance note adds to this.Ageas is sensitive to interest rates with a 100-basis-point upward shock in interest rates reducing shareholders' equity by close to EUR 1.4 billion. Similarly, a 30% fall in the value of equities listed in Europe, Asia, and Africa would lead to a nearly EUR 900 million decline in shareholder value. The combined impact would result in a 20% fall in shareholders' equity.Between product and corporate governance, for Ageas corporate governance looks to be a larger issue.","Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Ageas is Standard.Morningstar believes Ageas has a weak balance sheet. While the solvency of Ageas is strong at 202%, we believe the business is overleveraged, with over 50% debt to equity. Further, investment opportunities seem elusive with the primary target for investment being digital. We believe Ageas' distributions are appropriate.","Ageas is a life and nonlife insurance company that derives most of its income from life and savings, mostly from Belgium and is headquartered in Brussels. Ageas is essentially the result of the failed bid for ABN Amro by Banco Santander; Fortis; Royal Bank of Scotland. The capital requirements placed on these banks as a result of the acquisition combined with severe write-downs on its collateralised debt obligations in the case of Fortis left the business requiring capital. A less successful capital raising that took place during the global financial crisis wasn't enough and the bank, Fortis, had to be sold and nationalized. What remained was Fortis Insurance, which in 2010 was renamed to Ageas.","Morningstar believes Ageass financial health is poor.Ageas has quite a high amount of debt on its balance sheet relative to the amount of capital that shareholders own. While the interest Ageas pays on this debt is quite low, the fluctuation of the value in the RNPI and the high value of associates means we feel the quality of Ageas balance sheet isnt high. Furthermore, cash seems to be low and Ageas management have discussed either a buyback or eyeing more mergers and acquisitions. We prefer buybacks unless the business is looking to buy into more of its existing partnerships within its Asian operations.We dont particularly like that Ageas runs its own reinsurance division. This is only for its nonlife sales and the rationale provided by management is this diversification frees up capital for investment and distributions to shareholders. However, for us it just doesnt sit right. Ageas doesnt have deep expertise here, and while the lines in nonlife that it underwrites are standard, we think it would be much more sensible to leave this to the experts and focus on what it knows. This would provide more comfort in anticipation of an extreme event, so that Ageas balance sheet was fully equipped to handle it.The majority of Ageas financial investments are held in government debt.",AGS.BR,Financial Services,7266025472.0,BRU,15066.0,EUR,39.36000061035156,True,0,36.807424961835636,39.356626671483134,0

EBIT margin expansion occurred across geographies and business units supported by higher pricing but also benefited from the divestment of its cement business in India last year. Similarly to Heidelberg Materials, which upgraded its EBIT margin guidance in its trading update last week, Holcim has followed suit, raising its full-year EBIT margin guidance to above 17% from 16%.

Organic sales grew 4.3% during the third quarter, but this was offset by divestments and unfavorable currency movements, which led to an 8.8% decline in reported revenue. Geographically, Latin America was the best performing region, delivering 21% organic revenue growth, which is its 13th consecutive quarter of organic profit growth. North America and Europe both reported organic revenue growth of 8.7% and 6.5%, respectively, whereas the market in China was flagged as soft. The Solutions and Product segment, which mostly consists of roofing, declined by 8.8% against a tough comparable and subsequent destocking. The group expect the segment to return to growth during the fourth quarter. Holcim continues to utilize its strong balance sheet, having made 21 bolt-on acquisitions for the year to date.","The shift in the product portfolio toward materials with lower capital (and energy) intensity will offer Holcim greater resilience from a possible economic downturn, where the majority of the segments exposure is to less cyclical repair and refurbishment activity. Cement production has a low threat of substitution, which, combined with a broad range of government stimulus, allows price increases to offset inflation to stick. The combination of a generous dividend policy and a record share-repurchase program provides investors with highly attractive cash yields.","Customers are no longer able to tolerate high prices for building materials due to a shift in the economic environment, which combined with an increase in interest rates has led to an increase in privately funded construction projects being canceled. The majority of Holcim's sales are generated from manufacturing cement, which is a notorious contributor of CO2 emissions and is likely to face increasing regulation. Management may look to lower the contribution of revenue from energy-intensive cement operations by performing value-destructive acquisitions.",21/04/2023,"The merger between Lafarge and Holcim in 2015 created the largest producer of building materials and introduced significant exposure to perceived faster-growing emerging markets, albeit with lower barriers to entry. However, the recent divestment of the Indian cement business (the group's second-largest geographic market) and a series of acquisitions focusing on lighter building materials have transformed Holcim's exposure to be predominantly geared toward mature markets. Holcims acquisition of Firestone Building Products combined with tuck-in acquisitions has increased the groups exposure to downstream products, where CRH has enjoyed success in the past. Cement manufacturers are notorious emitters of carbon dioxide, encouraging manufacturers to diversify operations to reduce regulatory scrutiny. Holcim targets 30% of its revenue to be generated from its downstream solutions and products segment by 2025. Recent divestments will likely see their target met ahead of expectations. The low value/weight product characteristics of cement require local production, resulting in the demand outlook for Holcims products being a function of local economic growth. The shift in product mix toward lighter building materials will offer Holcim greater resilience from a possible economic downturn, where the majority of the segments exposure is to less cyclical repair and refurbishment activity. Lighter building materials are also less energy-intensive, which has allowed the group to manage significant energy inflation better than some of its peers.  Holcim is rewarding investors with a generous dividend, which we expect to persist, given its strong balance sheet. Proceeds from divestments will also help fund its largest share-repurchase program through May 2023.","We assign a narrow moat rating to Holcim based on intangible assets in the form of permits, which allows the company to enjoy a transportation cost advantage over distant competitors. More than half of the companys sales (and an even greater percentage of EBITDA) is generated from the sale of cement and aggregates, which exhibit high weight/value product characteristics. These economics demand local production in order to prevent transportation costs from exceeding the costs of the actual product. Holcims production capabilities are situated in highly populated cities across the globe, which require permits that are both difficult and lengthy to obtain. These advantages make it difficult for distant competitors to replicate, protecting Holcims share in its many local markets.We believe Holcim warrants a narrow moat rating based on the difficult-to-obtain intangible assets in the form of regulatory permits. The companys production facilities are located in close proximity to its customers in highly populated cities, the source of most construction activity. The energy-intensive production process of clinker (an intermediate product of cement) has severe negative environmental effects and thus faces significant opposition from communities (not in my backyard). This presents new entrants with significant regulatory hurdles, which authorities are unlikely to approve and thus protects Holcims existing market position. Permits are more difficult to obtain in developed markets, which we estimate account for close to 56% of group sales. These hurdles were recently experienced prior to building the companys Ste. Genevieve cement plant in Missouri (one of the largest cement plants in the world), which took several years before construction was authorized. Recent divestments (mostly in the Asia-Pacific) has seen the company exit many regions in emerging markets where regulatory intangible assets are not as strong.Holcims intangible asset moat source allows the company to enjoy a low-cost advantage over distant competitors. The high weight/value of cement and aggregates requires local production as transporting these materials vast distances is not economical. Outside competitors would need to lower their profitability, by reducing selling prices, in order to incentivize construction customers to incur higher transportation costs. This dynamic ensures local players are able to operate profitably, provided there is sufficient demand, without too much concern about imports or new entrants increasing supply and depressing local prices. Holcims largest market, North America (40% of group sales), has underinvested in infrastructure and is likely to benefit from a new infrastructure bill.We fail to award Holcims vertically integrated downstream operations a moat on a stand-alone basis. Despite ready-mix concrete (a combination of aggregates, cement, and water) being an extremely heavy product and requiring production facilities to be close to consumption, replicating a mixing plant is relatively straightforward, with any permits required being easy to obtain. The production of asphalt and concrete has lower CO2 emissions than cement and thus does not have the same detrimental effect on the environment. Therefore, unlike cement, concrete production is not met with the fierce opposition that opening a cement kiln faces due to the direct impact it has on the well-being of a community.Despite our no-moat rating for Holcims downstream operations, the production of these materials is less capital-intensive than the production of cement and is unlikely to destroy value for the group. Although these products have a dilutive impact on operating margins, vertical integration allows construction material producers to gain incremental value with limited additional capital being invested.","We assign a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Holcim. Demand for the companys products is determined by construction activity, which is tied to forces outside Holcim's control. Key drivers include economic growth, consumer confidence, and availability of credit. In addition, input costs, which include coal and other energy-related commodities (10% of sales), are subject to volatile prices, resulting in volatile profitability.The production of aggregates and cement is capital- and energy-intensive with a high degree of fixed costs. High utilization rates of production facilities are required to be profitable. In periods of low demand, competitors can use price as a mechanism to achieve economies of scale and thus lower margins.Holcims biggest environmental, social, and governance risk is around increased regulation of emissions in its own production of cement. We believe there is a likely probability of increased regulation surrounding carbon emissions but think costs are likely to be passed on to customers, limiting the economic impact. Holcim also has long- and short-term initiatives to lower its carbon emissions, such as lowering its clinker ratio during the production of cement and investing in carbon-capture technologies. Approximately CHF 500 million of capital expenditures is spent a year on green initiatives and low-CO2 products.Certain regions, most notably Europe, have imposed stringent regulations on CO2 emissions, which could lead to future penalties or recurring expenditures. While these additional costs could decrease supply and push smaller competitors out of the industry, the length of time this takes to occur is uncertain. This could result in a scenario where Holcim has committed capital to more sustainable products but does not experience an immediate reward through improved pricing.","We assign a Standard capital allocation rating to Holcim. Following the merger between Lafarge and Holcim, the company has divested assets in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore at attractive multiples. The recent divestment of its Indian business, its second-largest geographic market, for CHF 6.4 billion accelerates the groups shift in product mix toward less carbon-intensive cement operations, one of the contributors to a discount being placed on the groups share price. Proceeds have strengthened the balance sheet to one of the strongest in the sector and helped fund the $3.4 billion acquisition of Firestone Building Products without negatively affecting its balance sheet's sound rating. The healthy balance sheet has also enabled the company to maintain paying attractive dividends to shareholders as well as a record share-repurchase program for the group. We don't believe the acquisition of Firestone Building Products significantly influences the company's competitive position.Jan Jenisch has served as CEO since 2017, having been hired from chemicals group Sika, where he served as CEO for five years. Jenisch took over from Eric Olsen who resigned under a cloud of uncertainty. We think Jenischs leadership experience has brought stability and helped strengthen the companys balance sheet. Under his tenure there has been a large focus on strengthening the balance sheet after the Lafarge and Holcim merger and reducing exposure to emerging markets. We believe this has been the correct approach, given the high levels of risk introduced from transformational M&A and lower barriers to entry in emerging markets. While Jenisch announced he will be stepping down as CEO, he we will become chairman of the board, ensuring no disruption to the group and its strategy.Thomas Schmidheiny, a descendant of the founder and previous CEO, owns 8% of the companys shares, which we believe will require the group to maintain its attractive dividend policy.We appreciate the company adhering to best-practice corporate-governance guidelines of separating the duties between the CEO and chair. It is also promising to see that more than half of the board members were elected within the past five years, eliminating staleness and allowing a fresh look at the companys strategy.","Holcim is a global manufacturer of construction materials such as cement, aggregates, and concrete. The company is the result of a merger between Lafarge and Holcim, completed in 2015, which created a leader in the building materials sector. Holcim has a global presence, operating in over 70 countries with 72,000 employees.","Holcim currently enjoys a strong balance sheet. We believe this will support stable capital returns to shareholders despite operating in a cyclical industry. Even with a relatively ambitious bolt-on merger and acquisition strategy, Holcim aims to keep net debt/EBITDA below 1.5 times, which we forecast it will comfortably achieve.Recent divestments of its Indian and Brazilian businesses totaling over $7 billion further enhance the group's financial position. Following the $3.4 billion acquisition of Firestone Building Products in 2021, the group has performed further bolt-on deals to expand its downstream offering and reduce the contribution of earnings generated from cement, which is a notorious contributor to CO2 emissions.",HOLN.SW,Basic Materials,36888485888.0,EBS,144677.0,CHF,62.93999862670898,True,0,58.72302325936161,67.9843903518317,1
24/11/2023,United Microelectronics Shows Stronger Pricing Power and Readies for a Piece of AI Pie,United Microelectronics Corp,2303,4,26/10/2023,Phelix Lee,50.3,TWD,24/11/2023,62.0,High,,Standard,,26/10/2023,"Our fair value estimate for no-moat United Microelectronics Corp, or UMC, stays at TWD 62 per share after minor changes. Managements comments on consumer electronics demand bottoming and an unimpressive automotive outlook are in line with what other firms in our coverage have said so far. UMCs shares remain undervalued, in our view, pressured by uncertain short-term automotive and industrial demand. We believe UMC is virtually unaffected by updated U.S. chip export rules as of Oct. 17, as its yet-to-ramp artificial intelligence-related products have little influence on chip performance. Both revenue and profitability in the third quarter were above our expectations. Although capacity utilization fell 4 percentage points sequentially to 67%, revenue rose 1.4% sequentially to TWD 57.1 billion, and gross and operating margins were flat from the June quarter at 35.9% and 25.8%, respectively, due to the 4% appreciation of the USD against the TWD. Fourth-quarter guidance is within our expectations, with the top line dropping 5% in USD terms and gross margin in the low 30s. Management projects utilization to trend further down to the low 60s from 67% as 8-inch wafer demand is affected by inventory adjustment in automotive products. Management did not say when the adjustment will end, but we think it is likely to last throughout the first half of 2024, as end demand outside of China is dampened by rising monthly payments (from higher interest rates) and high inventory levels implied by lithium battery production in China outstripping sales by up to 30%. UMC has been receiving rush orders related to PCs and smartphones, a sign of demand bottoming out. However, we think recovery remains slow, and so leave our 2024 estimates unchanged for now. Consistent measured attempts to optimize 28nm capacity and ready 14nm capability are what we like about UMC compared with other non-TSMC foundries.","The advent of 5G and Internet of Things has created new avenues of growth for nonleading foundries like UMC, where cost, power and reliability are favored over performance. UMCs ROI-focused strategy frees the company from the traditional pitfalls of overspending in capital expenditures and R&D. UMC will be successful in using long-term agreements to protect its financial performance should the semiconductor market cool.",UMCs pause in new process technologies weakens its position against Chinese foundries like SMIC. U.S. restrictions on Chinese semiconductor firms are not consistent enough to influence foundry expansion plans. Reticence in expansion may lead to a loss in market share.,27/07/2023,"United Microelectronics is the worlds third-largest dedicated contract chip manufacturer, or foundry. It makes integrated circuits for customers based on their proprietary IC designs. The company has long benefited from U.S. and increasingly Asian semiconductor companies moving to fabless (no factory) business models, bolstering demand for UMC's services. United Microelectronics, like all foundries, assumes the costs and capital expenditures of running factories amid a highly cyclical market for its customers. Such cyclicality stems from the fact that foundries tend to add excessive capacity during times of burgeoning demand that can result in underutilization during downturns that hamper profitability. The rise of fabless semiconductor firms has created attractive growth prospects for the foundry segment, which has in turn encouraged increased competition. After achieving little differentiation for years from competing foundries like SMIC and GlobalFoundries by node advancements, United Microelectronics is displaying progress in improving profitability by focusing on new applications of mature process technology, or nodes, and reining in capital expenditures and research and development. The development of cutting-edge products is no longer United Microelectronics' strategy, so we expect a mid-single-digit revenue CAGR, driven by the Internet of Things, Wi-Fi, specialty memory, radio frequencies, display drivers, image sensing, in-vehicle infotainment systems, and power management applications for the next five years. Meanwhile, depreciation expenses should decline in the next five years since United Microelectronics has lowered capital expenditures from 2018, fueling respectable margin improvements. Things could change if U.S. sanctions stifle SMICs operations, in which case United Microelectronics could focus its efforts on GlobalFoundries. GlobalFoundries has an upper hand in technology, but struggles to attain positive EBITDA. United Microelectronics consistently records net profit. Thus, we believe UMC is better equipped to expand capacity to fill any gap left over by SMIC.","We don't believe UMC has a moat. UMCs most advanced manufacturing process, or node, is nine years behind leaders like TSMC and Samsung Electronics. Given UMC is a technological laggard, we do not foresee it will have meaningful defenses when competitors cut prices, evidenced by its similar average selling price to SMIC. Before a chip shortage in mid-2020, UMCs flagship 28nm node has been in oversupply for years, thus customers have no difficulty finding alternative suppliers save for short periods of shortages. The companys similar average selling price and margins to SMIC, and historical average and projected five-year ROIC that is not consistently above the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, are indicative of a no-moat business.A series of coincidences have permanently slowed UMCs node advancement. UMC and TSMC used to compete neck and neck in terms of node advancement, introducing new nodes within a year from each other up to the early 2000s. However, a chain of decisions which appeared reasonable at the time, led to results that left much to be desired. In the late 1990s, the companys efforts to set up its own IC design units was criticized for pitting itself against customers, which resulted in spinoffs of MediaTek, among other companies. A 1997 fire also devastated UMC, wiping out a major joint venture, or JV. In the early 2000s, UMC opted for JVs to share the burden of costly investments typical in the semiconductor industry and secure orders from JV partners. The downside is, UMC could not fulfill orders at a factory of its choosing, as JV partners objected on intellectual property and supply stability grounds. Also, JV partners feared UMC may have used their proprietary intellectual property on other customers. These led to suboptimal utilization and a lack of cutting-edge orders, and gradually the JVs could not generate the profits required for subsequent nodes.Manufacturing know-how and capital requirements are the main semiconductor moat sources. Semiconductor manufacturing is technology- and capital intensive. While for every foundry each successive node requires exponentially more research, development and capital expenditures; customers are only willing to pay a premium to first movers. While node advancements are viewed as evolutionary, manufacturing methods may change drastically every few nodes. In CPUs and mobile system-on-chips, or SoCs, where node advancements are most felt, planar processes are only used up to the 22/20nm node. Fin field-effect transistor, or FinFET, is used from 16/14nm, and is expected to be uses in TSMCs 3nm and Samsungs 5nm nodes. Gate all-around, or GAA, will succeed FinFET, but UMC has no plans to pursue GAA due to cost concerns. Successive technologies improve electrical performance and miniaturization to fit as many transistors as possible onto chips; thus improving performance relative to cost. In a nutshell, breakthroughs in semiconductor manufacturing aim to improve the power performance area, or PPA, a metric to illustrate the frontiers of current technology.FinFET is a recent technology that eliminated most foundries from advancing further. Only the largest five foundries--TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, UMC and SMIC--possess FinFET-related know-how. Yet only TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries can meet customers stringent constraints in mass production. UMC has suspended expansion of 14nm capacity while SMIC is still ramping up. Manufacturers that decide to halt FinFET R&D have little choice other than divesting, like Panasonic in 2019, Fujitsus 12-inch operations in 2019, and IBM in 2014.","We assign UMC a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High.UMC operates in the semiconductor industry, which is one of the most cyclical ones. During upturns, foundries must ensure enough production capacity to satisfy strong demand. During downturns, foundries must deal with excess capacity and the corresponding high fixed costs related to its fabrication plants. UMCs earnings are volatile, with its operating margin in the last 10 years peaking at 17% in 2011 and bottoming at negative 0.2% in 2019. The volatility is structural for two reasons. First, the company reprices its products frequently during oversupply and shortages. Second, customers tend to favor TSMC as their primary foundry, magnifying drops in UMCs utilization rate during downturns. Third, UMCs products are mostly commoditized and lack defenses to counter price declines.UMC has modest client concentration risk, with the largest customer accounting for 9% of revenue in 2022. Texas Instruments and MediaTek are among UMCs largest customers. Given close alternatives like GlobalFoundries and SMIC exist, we believe UMC can impose few switching costs on customers.Currency risk is limited as most sales, purchases of raw materials and equipment are made in U.S. dollars. While intellectual property disputes are a major risk for the firm, the recent settlement of the court case in the U.S. is a sign of such risks being promptly managed.Semiconductor manufacturing requires a lot of electricity and water. Production may be interrupted under long periods of drought, as in early 2021. The company works with government agencies and suppliers to ensure supply of electricity, backup supply of water, and to enhance waste and water treatment systems.","We assess UMC's Capital Allocation Rating as Standard. The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry leads us to view low gearing, to the point of appearing inefficient, as essential to weather bad times. Even so, we do not believe UMCs ability to capture acquisition opportunities is impaired. For instance, it acquired the remaining 84.1% of Fujitsus semiconductor fab in Japan in 2019 for TWD 15.7 billion, after purchasing 15.9% in 2014. The fab was renamed USJC after the deal. USJC products cover 40nm, 65nm and 90nm process technologies, serving automobile and Internet of Things markets. The deal makes sense to us, as the two markets are ripe with opportunities that do not require cutting-edge nodes. However, it is difficult for us to consider an exemplary rating without numbers proving synergies as most non-cutting-edge products are commodities.UMC has been paying dividends every year since 2010. Since adopting the current ROI-focused strategy in 2018, management intends to distribute 85%-95% of earnings per share to shareholders, which is currently working as intended. The ratio is higher than the five-year averages of TSMCs 50% and Samsung Electronics 40%. While this does not affect companys investment ability in the next one or two years, beyond that management may be forced to increase gearing or cut distributions. That may be a reason for stopping short of devising a formal dividend policy other than vaguely stating that cash dividends will make up at least 20% of total dividends. We foresee UMCs dividend per share being volatile as well as its earnings, leading to high risk of cuts in the next five years.UMC is striving to improve capital efficiency by requiring guarantee payments for customers who want to reserve capacity. The company has more than TWD 30 billion in customer prepayments sitting on its books, which shows success in matching capital expenditure expenses with receipts from customers.","Founded in 1980, United Microelectronics is the world's third-largest dedicated chip foundry, with 7% market share in 2022 after TSMC and GlobalFoundries. UMCs headquarters are in Hsinchu, Taiwan, and it operates 12 fabs in Taiwan, Mainland China, Japan and Singapore, with additional sales offices in Europe, the U.S. and South Korea. UMC features a diverse customer base including Texas Instruments, MediaTek, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Xilinx and Realtek, supplying a wide range of products applied in communications, display, memory, automotive and more. UMC employs about 20,000 people.","UMC has maintained a reasonably strong balance sheet despite its unstable earnings. The company mostly maintained a net cash position up to 2014, then incurred large cash outflows during 2015 to 2018 before regaining net cash status in 2019. The main reason for the cash drain was UMCs rapid expansion of 28nm capacity, which caused the companys capital expenditures to increase from 2013s TWD 33 billion to 2016s peak of TWD 91.6 billion before dropping to TWD 26 billion in 2020. Unfortunately, utilization of 28nm capacity remained low--we estimate it to be less than 80%--until mid-2020 due to oversupply. Because of low utilization, UMC could not muster the capital required to mass-produce 14nm products, and it was forced to drop out of the cutting-edge race with TSMC and Samsung. The high capital expenditures not only dragged down profitability in the form of high depreciation, but also contributed to UMCs switch to a ""return on investment-focused"" strategy.The annual gross margin has fluctuated between 14% and 45% for the past decade. The weakness for the six months ended March 2019 was in line with other semiconductor companies, as utilization dropped amid the U.S.-China trade war, possible Huawei bans and smartphone weakness. We expect the gross margin to at low-30s for the next five years, as the company continues to strengthen its niche in power management and connectivity semiconductor products while spending TWD 100 billion on a new fab in Tainan.UMC has been paying dividends since 2010, but dividend per share has ranged from TWD 0.41 to TWD 3, averaging a 72% payout. Since adopting the current ROI-focused strategy in 2018, management intends to distribute 85%-95% of earnings per share to shareholders, and this is currently working as intended.

The growth is mainly attributable to the property and casualty segment where Europ Assistance and motor insurance have grown well. Generalis overall property and casualty combined ratio has improved versus the same period last year, though half of that improvement is due to higher discounting. The impact of natural catastrophe losses over the first 9 months amounts to EUR 875 million and those losses have primarily been caused by floods and hailstorms in Italy, Greece, and Central and Eastern Europe. Human-made losses have amounted to a little under EUR 400 million. Overall, Generali property and casualty has delivered a 94.3% combined ratio, 97.9% undiscounted, and versus the same period last year that is an improvement. Property and casualty operating profit is EUR 2.15 billion, marked by nonoperational developments. In life insurance, the business hasnt fared as well with a decline in net flows to EUR 1.2 billion. While net flows in protection and unit-linked products have both fared well, there have been significant outflows in savings products to the tune of EUR 8.7 billion. These outflows have been particularly strong in France and Italy. The new business margin has improved slightly as a result of this change in product mix. Life insurance operating profit has dropped to EUR 2.8 billion. In asset and wealth management Generali has delivered a mid-single-digit rise in operating profit to EUR 728 million. This has mainly been driven by a rise in Banca Generalis net interest margin. Net inflows into Banca Generali over the first 9 months amounted to EUR 4.3 billion. We maintain our EUR 21 fair value estimate and no moat rating.",Generalis life insurance business continues to shift toward a higher portion of hybrid and unit-linked products. The asset management strategy is substantially paying off. Rising asset yields should help the income on the traditional life and pensions back book and provide a tailwind for expansion of spreads.,"While unit and indexed linked investment products provide fees, asset levels do affect these fee levels. Wealth management is extremely sensitive to fluctuations and movements of capital markets. Leverage continues to be a bit of a problem, and Generali should seek to pay down debt as and when it can.",25/05/2023,"While Generali is a leveraged company, we view that by and large its operations are of high quality. The company has been building out a strong asset management offering to complement its life division, contributions from fees within life have been growing, and the technical margin remains resilient. The company's non-life division is also one of the best in our list of multilines with technical metrics that exceed peers in most of its markets. For its peripheral operations, such as Asia and South America, there is substantial room for improvement but from those that contribute the most they have been shaped into strong franchises. What tends to hurt Generali and make it an overlooked business, in our opinion, is its lack of exposure and operations in North America. It is predominantly a European insurance company, and so it has missed out on significant revenue and profit potential from North America, and this has led to a market cap lag. However, despite recent turmoil for leadership, we think the current management team has done well. Carving out respectable and good operations in key markets, there is plenty for the business and it can also focus on these peripheral markets. Overall, Generali is a largely overlooked European multiline that deserves more attention and versus other larger peers is comparatively better managed.","We believe Generali does not benefit from an economic moat because the business has earned below its cost of equity in return on equity.Generali is balanced between a pension, life, and savings business, a non-life insurer, and a nice business in asset management. Traditional life insurance savings and pensions are geared to rates of return on investment because they earn a spread from the assets they invest in over the guarantees they provide. This makes traditional life and savings business geared toward capital markets. However, as these products have become less and less popular with both consumers and companies, the business is increasingly selling unit-linked style investment products that dovetail well into Generali's strategy for asset management. Traditional savings products tend to be invested in fixed income assets whereas unit-linked style products are invested in a whole host of different investments. With Generali's strategy to build out and partner with boutique investment houses, the business has broadened the appeal of these products and likely provided an uptick in performance for underlying policyholders. While these products do not provide spread-based income, they do provide loading fees and fees on assets with these fees on assets still linked to the performance of capital markets. Total fees from unit and index linked products now account for a low-double-digit percent of the life division's income, though that has been growing from low single digits since the business started to focus on this strategy.Protection is another key components of the life divisions income and earnings, with margin on revenue and technical margin accounting for around one third of that division's income. We think that these sources of revenue are defensive and generally hold their profit profile, and Generali has a nice distribution channel for wealthier clients through its private bank. This means that while the investment margin has been under pressure on this traditional back book and the investment result has been declining as a percentage premiums, income generated on the sale of protection products and fees generated on investment products have provided a nice counter. And while Generali has been shifting away, over time, from this guaranteed business because of the pressures on investment income, as the macro environment shifts to one of climbing interest rates these products will start to again, in time, provide a profit tailwind and not headwind.Complementing Generali's life insurance division is its non-life unit that we think is one of the best non-life operations within our list of multilines. Bar France, and its peripheral Asia and Southern Europe markets' underwriting standards are always excellent.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Generali is Medium.Generali is a smaller and more local peer within the group of European multilines. The business continues to write very little business outside its core European markets. This has resulted in a relatively straightforward and traditional insurance company that has peripheral divisions of private banking and asset management. Generalis inroads into asset management have made this a good and reliable source of income over recent years. And while the business writes quite a lot of savings and pensions business, we anticipate the product mix is relatively traditional and low risk. Generali has also successfully built out its unit-linked and nonmotor business in recent years and has chosen its markets well, focusing on conservative countries. We expect this to be good for rates of switching. However, with persistent inflation and questions over growth looming combined with high leverage and sensitive solvency, we think Generali has Medium Uncertainty.","We assign Generali a Poor Morningstar capital allocation rating.While Generali's solvency ratio is strong at 227% at the end of first-quarter 2023, we believe the company has high sensitivities. Investments have been fair to good with a particularly beneficial round of money spend on building out its boutique third-party asset management partnerships. Against this sensitive balance sheet, we think distributions have been weak.","Assicurazioni Generali is a financial services company that offers life insurance, general insurance, and asset-management. While the company is listed in Italy, France and Germany are also key markets. Germany is the company's second largest life market by quite some margin, and this is a market that carries a high proportion of traditional products with guarantees.","Generali is a overleveraged with debt/capital coming in a little under 100%. While the business has been bringing this profile down over the years, in our view that leverage is still a high. The majority of Generali's financial liabilities do mature between five and 10 years out, which is a good thing and nearly all interest rates are fixed rate with only two lumps of debt carrying punitive interest rates.

25/11/2023,"Short-Term Challenges Persist, but Ocado Is Well Placed To Benefit From Structural Long-Term Trends",Ocado Group PLC,OCDO,5,19/09/2023,Ioannis Pontikis,559.8,GBP,23/11/2023,1550.0,Very High,,Exemplary,,19/09/2023,"Ocado Retail, a joint venture between Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer, reported a third-quarter trading update for the 13 weeks to Aug. 27, 2023, with retail revenue up 7.2% (versus 5% in the first half) and a return to positive volume growth in the last month of the quarter. Ocado Retail's good performance was driven by: 1) customer growth of 1.5% to 961,000; 2) growth in average orders per week of 1.9% to 381,000; and 3) the average basket value increasing 4.2%in turn due to 8.4% higher average selling price (lower than inflation), offset by smaller basket sizes (at 44 items per order, stable sequentially). The company maintained 2023 guidance, expecting Ocado Retail to grow at a mid-single-digit rate (versus 5% in our model) and be marginally positive, mainly driven by a second-half return to volume growth and improved capacity utilization. We don't expect to change our GBX 1,550 fair value estimate for Ocado. After a volatile period for the share price, reaching a low of GBX 380 in June of this year and bouncing back strongly over the last three months at around GBX 800 levels, shares are trading in 4-star territory.","We see Ocado Smart Platform as the most efficient and reliable end-to-end online fulfilment solution for the grocery market nowadays. Ocados global opportunity is immense, driven by the potential of online penetration in the grocery market. OSP is the result of Ocados relentless focus on solving the online grocery riddle through cutting-edge proprietary technology that is hard to replicate.","There is considerable execution risk involved in rolling out committed CFCs for partners/grocers over the next few years. Ocado's solution is significantly more capital-intensive than alternatives (for example microfulfilment) with longer payback timetables. There are considerable front-load financing needs ahead for Ocado as it rolls out its partners CFC network, which exposes the company to external capital market conditions (debt, equity).",17/01/2023,"Ocado Group offers exposure in one of retail's largest and most dynamic segments: global online food retailing. We think that the Ocado Smart Platform is well positioned to become one of the most sought-after online grocery fulfilment solutions for big brick-and-mortar grocers predominantly in developed markets as online penetration advances. Our thesis is shaped by our analysis of the following five elements: 1) Ocado's intellectual property and experience; 2) the underlying economics of customer fulfilment centers; 3) the potential profitability of Ocado's partners and competitive landscape; 4) the global opportunities ahead; and 5) the long-term impact of Ocado's emerging competitive advantages. We think that Ocado's technological advancements through the creation of proprietary hardware and software have resulted in greater warehouse efficiency that might be shared with partners/grocers, resulting in a market-leading value proposition. With volumes shifting progressively to the online channel, the evolving channel mix of grocers is steadily eroding their in-store profits, indicating big worldwide opportunities for Ocado in coming decades. We do not ascribe a moat to Ocado because we believe the nature of the company's solutions business and its early stage of development, with major execution risks ahead, increases the probability of permanent value erosion in the event of future operational mishaps. However, as additional partners join Ocado's platform we expect the emergence of network effects and strengthening of intangible assets, switching costs, and cost benefits. We anticipate that online grocery penetration will increase to 25% by 2040 across a group of developed nations, from around 4% in Western Europe and 8% in the United Kingdom in 2021, with OSP capturing approximately 10% of these markets. Consequently, we expect strong profitability and returns in the next few years, bolstered by the adoption of additional automation in operations (robotic picking) and scalability as the network of CFCs and partners grows.","We do not attribute an economic moat to Ocado. We believe that the company is showing traits of intangible assets, cost advantages, network effects, and client switching costs underpinning its solutions business, Ocado Solutions (less than 10% of group sales). That said, we think that the nature of Ocados solutions business (driven by proof of concept and a successful record), and the fact that its still in the early stages of expansion with significant execution risks ahead, increases the likelihood of permanent value destruction in case of future operational mishaps such as slower-than-expected rollouts or lower-than-expected operating efficiencies). Strategic partnerships with several leading grocers across the world and years of spending on proprietary software and material handling equipment should support Ocado Solutions intangible assets in the future, while improving efficiency and reliability along with continuous enhancements of its proprietary technology platform could lead to customer stickiness once those partnerships fully materialise. We also see emerging cost advantages, but we do not think they are significant enough to contribute to Ocado Solutions competitive standing yet (although they benefit the groups retail business).In our opinion, Ocados years of research and development investments, intellectual property, and relentless focus on the problem of online grocery delivery over the last 20-plus years of its existence have widened the knowledge gap versus potential competition (grocers as well as software and warehouse equipment companies), rendering its offering highly valuable to any grocer that wants to embrace the online channel. Although still a small part of the groups sales, Ocado Solutions is unique in that there is no direct competitor yet providing end-to-end online grocery fulfilment solutions that combine fully integrated software and material handling equipment, or MHE. There are operators providing e-commerce business solutions (software) to grocery retailers, such as Instacart at the low-cost end and IBM WebSphere, SAP Hybris, and Oracle Commerce in the high-customization space. Similarly, there are several suppliers of MHE to the grocery industry, such as TGW and Witron. However, none of them offer a fully integrated platform capability, and no competitor has the day-to-day experience of running an online grocery operation. We think Ocados retail operations not only act as a showcase for the solutions business capabilities but also contribute to improving the solutions offered to Ocados partners through continual learning and customer feedback. Ocados comprehensive end-to-end online fulfillment solution consists of three main modules: a front-end interface for ordering (grocery webshop with tailored mobile and tablet applications and back-end systems to analyze consumer habits and customer data for smart recommendation systems), automated fulfillment in CFCs (including a store pick system for areas that CFCs cannot cater), and last-mile operations for delivery (Ocado provides the routing and in-van technology, which helps track orders and drive cost efficiencies by planning the most effective and economic route to sequence deliveries). Other than Ocados centralized fulfilment model, which uses large, highly automated CFCs, online grocery retailers fulfil orders using either store pick (manually collected items sourced from existing nearby retail stores), dark stores (quasi-warehouses with efficient merchandizing not open to customers from which orders are manually picked), or a combination. Recently, a number of grocers have signed small-scale agreements with micro-fulfillment providers as an alternative to manual store-based pick. Any grocer or solutions provider seeking to assemble a platform equivalent to Ocados would need to invest time and capital in the integration of software and hardware (MHE) from several suppliers. In addition to the time and capital constraints, any customized platform solution that includes a combination of software and MHE from different suppliers would entail integration risk and uncertainty concerning the quality of the final untested online grocery service product. This is particularly important for large-scale grocery operations, which feature continually varying product ranges with diverse shelf lives and temperature requirements, further complicated by customer demands for accuracy and reliable delivery slots. Ocado offers the same reliable technology platform that is available to its successful retail business in the U.K., with the latters strong operational and performance metrics (even relative to much larger brick-and-mortar peers that should be able to better leverage costs) constituting a testament to the solutions unit capabilities, minimizing any perceived uncertainty around the integration and effectiveness of the offered solution for risk-averse grocers.The pre-COVID-19 profitability of Ocado Retail (which utilizes Ocado Solutions technology platform) is superior or at least equivalent to that of scale-advantaged traditional supermarkets in the U.K., an outperformance that we think emanates from its industry-leading CFCs, particularly their automation, use of own technology, and centralization. For instance, total labor hours used to fulfil an order (including delivery to CFC but not delivery to customer) runs 14 minutes, which according to the company saves up to 1 hour of labor when compared with store-based fulfilment used by supermarkets. Applying the U.K.s minimum hourly wage, this translates to more than GBP 8 per order or 8% of a typical Ocado basket size. Further, with fresh food products constituting almost 50% of a grocers sales, product waste is increasingly a concern in the industry. Ocados model enables it to carry lower inventory levels and to operate a first-in, first-out rotation dependent on shelf life, resulting in product waste of only 0.5% of sales across CFCs, the lowest in the industry (which averages around 3% in the U.K.). This reduces the firms markdowns despite its still carrying the most extensive range of products online (55,000 stock-keeping units) and maintaining best-in-class availability (99% order accuracy). This has been made possible by a strong understanding of the lifecycle of each product as every step in the online order cycle is carefully monitored and controlled. The customer interface, fulfillment, and delivery are all dynamically interlinked with advanced analytics optimizing the process, which enables a personalized and accurate customer experience through real-time inventory monitoring, slot booking, and guaranteed product life, among other factors. Finally, Ocados efficiency in last-mile delivery is unmatched in the U.K.; revenue per van per year is about 50% higher than the nearest competitors, driving substantial savings through improvements in its complex algorithms, which calculate delivery routes and cover variables such as the timing of a delivery slot, house location, and order volume.Although some of the order pick and last-mile advantages are consumed by presumably higher fuel costs versus the store pick model (as stores are closer to the destination), Ocados platform offering is still more attractive. Since 2016, when Ocado first started disclosing segmental information, Ocado Retail has exhibited an average 6.0% EBITDA margin versus about 6.0% for the group of large U.K. grocers under our coverage (which combine much more profitable brick-and-mortar operations with online businesses that break even or are only slightly profitable at the EBITDA level, by our estimates). The superior operational efficiency of Ocados end-to-end online grocery fulfillment solution is even more pronounced if we factor in scale-based advantages that those large supermarkets possess versus Ocados smaller U.K. operations; competitors enjoy a sales base about 10-25 times higher than Ocados, which could imply several percentage points of procurement benefit.We think the combination of reliability, flexibility, efficiency, and simplicity that Ocados platform offers to time- and capital-constrained grocers reflects the companys superior technology platform and could lead to additional long-term partnerships (building on eight partnerships already signed) and sticky client relationships. Cost efficiency in this growing channel is crucial for grocers, given the industrys poor underlying economics: Margins are razor thin and highly dependent on volume, which is growing online and declining in stores. With volume increasingly migrating to the online channel and competition just a click away, grocers evolving channel mix is gradually diluting margins, laying fertile ground for new partnerships.For Ocados solutions business, new partnerships act as proofs of concept, which help validate its model in the eyes of future clients. Since the end of 2017, Ocado has announced several international partnerships as its technology platform gains acceptance worldwide. Once a grocer decides to partner with Ocado, we think its tough to switch to another solutions provider. The majority of the agreements contain exclusivity clauses, which are conditional on the grocers meeting specific market share targets or ordering an agreed number of CFCs per year. Typically, Ocado structures deals with three layers of fees: short term fees, which are payable immediately when a new deal is signed; medium-term fees, which cover the costs associated with adapting the platform to the needs of the partner and reflect the future size of the CFC; and long-term fees, which grow as the partner takes on more capacity. In that way, grocers that sign the agreement commit long-term capital as they contribute not only for the licensing of technology but also during the development phase, as they are typically responsible for the building and the capital involved in finding a suitable location for a CFC that can accommodate Ocados MHE integration as well as the vehicles used to deliver to customers. Assuming smooth execution from Ocado, it is hard to imagine a situation where an Ocado client would want to opt out of an agreement or switch to an alternative option, not only because of the sunk costs but also because of the time and implicit costs involved in transitioning to solutions never tested before. We think potential switching costs are even higher when considering the benefits that partners gain through the continuous enhancements and innovations in Ocados technology platform. Those improvements (in software and hardware) span from detection of fraudulent events through machine learning programs to significant enhancements of order-picking robots efficiencies (which helps bring down the long-term cost of ownership through a combination of lower capital and running costs). These typically have an instant impact on clients bottom lines and ensure that grocers can focus on the retail side of the business while Ocado takes care of the technology.Although we see cost advantages (through operational efficiencies of CFCs) being a big part of Ocados retail operations superior financial metrics versus pure online players and traditional supermarkets, these advantages are not exclusive and will be shared with any competitor that is willing to join Ocado as a partner in the solutions business; thus we believe that those advantages do not contribute to a moat for the retail business in the U.K.","We award Ocado a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High.In the U.K., Ocado Retail faces intense competition. The grocer's Tesco ""price match"" have also resulted in significant price reductions over the years, hitting Ocado disproportionately compared with larger competitors who may leverage their higher purchasing power.Although Ocado's solutions business is the clear driving force and top focus moving ahead, the market is currently modest and it will take time to scale up capacity from a healthy pipeline of committed CFCs. We expect a possible trade-down in grocery consumption and a decline in consumers' out-of-home spending to partially offset higher food costs due to inflationary pressures, owing to the industry's defensive nature. However, we expect inflation or/and recession to have a greater impact on Ocado, given its exposure to larger baskets (average of more than GBP 100) and its added delivery costs per order.Given the increased importance of the solutions business, particularly after the sale of half of Ocado's U.K. retail business to M&S, the firm risks failing to successfully commercialize its solutions technology overseas due to service disruptions, quality issues, or slow online adoption growth in the markets where Ocado's grocers/partners operate. We believe the possibility of such severe occurrences (service failures) to be relatively low, but their potential impact on the organization might be catastrophic. Ocado relies on its reputation to continue increasing its CFC pipeline, so execution or quality difficulties might hinder the firm's ability to acquire new partnerships or maintain existing ones.Claims of patent infringement, such as those made by Autostore over the core cavity of the robots, among others, pose a fundamental threat to Ocado's commercial growth efforts.We are not aware of any substantial environmental, social, or governance problems having an impact on our evaluation of Ocado's Uncertainty Rating.","We assign Ocado Group an Exemplary Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. This is based on managements capital allocation decisions over the last 20 years that have resulted in extraordinary value creation and returns for shareholders.Tim Steiner is CEO and co-founder and has been at the helm since the beginning of Ocados operations. Steiner was employed by Goldman Sachs as a bond trader in London, New York, and Hong Kong for eight years, before co-founding Ocado in 2000. Steiner has about a 3% share of the company, which helps align shareholder interests. Management has built a successful online grocery business over the years, the first of its kind in the U.K. and one of the first in the world, with an estimated midteens share of the U.K. online grocery market despite competing against established, scale-advantaged firms such as Tesco and Sainsburys. We think this has been the result of managements relentless focus on building a business model from scratch and reinventing the way consumers do their grocery shopping by achieving exceptional service levels, with 55,000 products available, 99% order accuracy, and 95% of Ocado deliveries on time or early, providing reliable delivery within a 1-hour window. This, in turn, has led to consistently high top-line growth (around 15% on average over the last decade), with Ocado outgrowing offline and online competitors without sacrificing profitability; its pre-COVID-19 mid-single-digit EBITDA margins are comparable with those of large brick-and-mortar grocers.We think managements major contribution has been the transformation of Ocado Group from an undifferentiated grocer into a technology company, offering the opportunity to develop lasting competitive advantages and create significant shareholder value. This has been accomplished through managements conviction that Ocados proprietary technology and end-to-end fulfilment system can be valuable to brick-and-mortar grocers around the world, which led to the development of Ocados latest-generation warehouse solution, a modular, highly scalable, and efficient solution that can be rolled out internationally, considerably expanding Ocados addressable market.","Ocado, one of the largest pure online grocers in the world, operates in two divisions. Ocado Retail is the group's online grocery business in the United Kingdom (joint venture with Marks & Spencer); it offers an extensive product range of over 55,000 items via its Ocado.com website and holds more than 15% of the U.K. online grocery market and approximately 2% of the total U.K. grocery market. Ocado Solutions is built on the Ocado Smart Platform, a modular, automated online retail fulfilment and delivery solution that involves the provision of software, fulfilment infrastructure, and support services to corporate clients for a variety of one-time and ongoing costs. OSP has allowed the company to work with some of the world's largest grocers, including Ocado's retail operation.","Ocado Group is in reasonably good financial health. There are no debt maturities until fiscal 2024, and the capital required to build its contracted CFCs for its partners over the next few years is covered by the proceeds from a recent GBP 875 million capital raise (GBP 578 million equity raise and GBP 300 million revolving credit facility). In our estimates, Ocado is well capitalised to continue rolling out its CFC network in new and existing contracts. Considering the strong pipeline and front-load investment needs, we project that the solutions business will generate positive free cash flows in fiscal 2029, from which point the group should largely be able to finance itself independently.Capital spending will remain elevated as expansion continues and online penetration increases (at 14% of sales on average over the next 10 years). Capital spending should continue to be elevated as the rollout of new CFCs require significant capital spending from Ocado and the client. As the CFC backlog decreases we expect capital spending to gradually decline to a more maintainable low-single-digit percentage, when we believe the online grocery market will reach maturity in the developed countries that are Ocados target markets.",OCDO.L,Consumer Defensive,5109719040.0,LSE,325497.0,GBp,567.5999755859375,True,1,679.1848836499581,580.0168670286615,1
24/11/2023,"For Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Inventory Correction Bottoms Out, Auto Demand Drives Long-Term Growth",Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd,009150,4,27/10/2023,Kazunori Ito,137000.0,KRW,24/11/2023,210000.0,High,Narrow,Standard,,27/10/2023,"Two multilayer ceramic capacitor, or MLCC, suppliers, Samsung Electro Mechanics and Yageo, reported their September quarter results on Oct. 26. As the stock reaction after the results showed, the two companies results were in stark contrast. While Samsung Electro Mechanics, or Semcos, stock price dropped more than 10% after the results because of the unexpected margin contraction, Yageos stock price rose about 5% on the next day after the results because of the solid margin outlook. Although Semcos results imply intensifying competition in MLCC, we are still optimistic that the company will grow at a faster pace than the market, driven by the share gains in MLCC for automobiles. We will revise our earnings forecasts as well as our fair value estimates after meeting with the companies; for now, we maintain our fair value estimates of KRW 210,000 for Semco and TWD 670 for Yageo. We believe that both companies are undervalued. While Semcos September-quarter revenue increased 6.3% sequentially, driven by better MLCC utilization, its operating margin unexpectedly fell to 7.8% from 9.2% in the June quarter. The company explained that Japanese competitors have lowered MLCC prices to take advantage of the weak Japanese yen. For example, over the past three years, the Japanese yen has depreciated more than 30% against the U.S. dollar, while the Korean won has depreciated about 15%-16%, giving Japanese suppliers some room to lower prices to gain market share. While we believe the sharp postearnings decline in Semcos stocks is caused by the growing concerns about intensifying price competition, we view that the price erosion for this quarter is mostly a one-time factor reflecting the current currency exchange rate and thus the price decline will moderate in subsequent quarters. ","Semco will be one of the beneficiaries of the increasing high-end MLCC demand from the smartphone, auto, and information infrastructure industries. Semcos auto MLCC revenue growth will exceed the industry average as top suppliers are not able to fulfill all the demand. FC-BGA shortage would remain until 2023-24, enabling much higher profitability than in the past.","Competition with Taiwanese and Chinese suppliers may intensify as the technological gap narrows, and Semco may struggle from the price decline of MLCCs. FC-BGA profitability may deteriorate as supply meets the demand earlier than expected. MLCC inventory correction may continue throughout 2022.",31/07/2023,"Samsung Electro-Mechanics is the global second supplier of multilayer ceramic capacitors, which account for 40%-45% of Semcos revenue and 50%-60% of operating income. MLCCs are necessary to stabilize and control electric flow, and thus necessary for all electronic circuits. We believe the robust demand for MLCCs, mainly from smartphone and automotive manufacturers, will be the driver of Semcos growth in the midterm. Over the past decade, the growth of passive components has been driven by smartphone demand. We expect the number of MLCCs per phone to continue to increase, as faster processing and communication speed require larger power consumption from smartphones, and more MLCCs will be necessary to enable longer battery life. We estimate that the number of MLCCs used per 5G smartphone is 10%-20% greater than that of 4G smartphones. As such, we expect that content growth per phone will continue to drive MLCC demand for smartphones. Overall, we expect low-to-midteens percentage growth per year for the MLCC demand from smartphone manufacturers. Similarly, we believe that content growth per auto will accelerate, driving auto MLCC demand in the midterm. With the tightening of environmental and safety regulations, electric devices per car would increase along with the rollout of electric vehicles and the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS. We forecast high-teens to 20% growth per year for auto MLCC demand. Semco may achieve even higher growth as we believe that top auto MLCC suppliers are not able to fulfill all the demand, and subsequent suppliers, including Semco, will likely benefit from the spillover effect.","We assign a narrow moat rating to Semco, based on the intangible assets of its MLCCs. MLCCs, which store electricity and stabilize electric flow, are essential to remove electromagnetic noise, regulate current flow in a circuit, and enable better battery life. Hence, MLCCs are used for all electronic circuits. We estimate that flagship smartphones contain more than 1,000 MLCCs per unit, laptops use 600-800 per unit, and autos use 3,000-8,000 per unit. The number of MLCCs per unit has been increasing, driven by the larger number of electronic devices and greater complexity of electronic circuits. For instance, some electric vehicles use more than 10,000 MLCCs per unit, and typical 5G smartphones use 10%-20% more MLCCs than 4G smartphones.Unlike semiconductors, the MLCC manufacturing process contains analog elements, which makes it difficult for new entrants to replicate. In order to increase the capacitance of MLCCs, it is necessary to stack hundreds of fine ceramic sheets of 1 micron or less. While hundreds of ceramic sheets and electrodes are stacked and fired, uniform material blending and proper temperature control are necessary to prevent internal cracks. As such, the manufacturing process, including the blending of ceramic powder and temperature control during firing, is a black box, and even manufacturing equipment is produced internally. Thus, we believe that only companies that can develop both raw materials and manufacturing processes in an integrated manner will be able to lead the development of MLCCs. We believe this knowledge and capability form the basis of MLCC companies intangible asset moats. Suppliers have been increasing the capacitance per MLCC every year, which has been contributing to miniaturizing the size of MLCCs. Currently, the worlds smallest MLCC is the 0201 size (0.25mm x 0.125mm), which can be mass-produced by only a limited number of suppliers. We believe that the technology gap between top suppliers and commodity suppliers is widening, and it will be quite difficult for the new entrants to develop an understanding of the material and obtain the production know-how to produce tens of billions of MLCCs per year. In fact, the major MLCC suppliers have not changed over the past 20 years. Semco increased its market share in the 2010s and established its position as the global second MLCC supplier when digital appliances such as smartphones, flat-panel TVs, and laptops became more popular. In our opinion, there were two major factors for this breakthrough. First, we believe that Semco has succeeded in miniaturizing MLCC ahead of some Japanese competitors such as TDK. Due to the diffusion of smartphones and 4G communication, the demand for small MLCCs increased rapidly, and Semco was able to meet the requirements of set makers by leveraging its internal material resources. Second, Semcos captive market has been its strength. Samsung Electronics is Semcos largest shareholder and the worlds largest consumer electronics company, and has been the leading handset and flat-panel TV manufacturer globally for more than a decade. We estimate that Samsung Electronics market share on handsets and flat-panel TVs was approximately 20% in 2021, and we believe Semco has been able to benefit from its parent companys growth in digital appliances. Although we do not assign a moat rating to Samsung Electronics set businesses, we expect Samsung Electronics will maintain its market share by leveraging its brand and cost competitiveness, as it can source most key components, such as displays, memory, and systems on chip, or SoCs, internally. We estimate that revenue from Samsung Electronics had accounted for more than 60% of Semcos entire revenue in the early 2010s. This number dropped to 34% in 2020 as Semco intended to diversify its client portfolio, but we expect Samsung Electronics to remain Semcos most important client in the future.Semcos ROIC has been unstable in the past because of the volatility of other business segments. Module segments profitability used to be low and bumpy, but we believe it will improve due to 1) the disposal of the low-margin communication module business in 2020; and 2) diversifying client portfolio for the camera module business. By acquiring Chinese manufacturers as customers, the camera module business profitability has become more resilient to Samsung Electronics smartphone production cycle. However, we forecast module segments operating margin to remain around the mid-single-digit percentage as the company needs to source key components externally. Similarly, we believe that the substrate solution segments profitability will improve as 1) average flip-chip ball grid array pricing, or FC-BGA, would improve owing to the tight supply/demand underpinned by the robust chip demand; and 2) Semco has just announced closure of the rigid-flexible print circuit board business, which has been making a loss. Meanwhile, we believe MLCCs solid profitability would continue, based on our view that MLCCs tight supply will last in the midterm. We forecast that top auto MLCC suppliers, Murata Manufacturing and TDK, will not be able to fulfill massive demand from the auto industry, and thus, Semco would benefit from the spillover effect. We forecast the auto industrys share of MLCC sales to increase to 25% in 2027 from 16% in 2022, contributing to improving Semcos product mix.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Semco is High.As the majority of Semcos production sites are based in South Korea and the rest are in Southeast Asian countries, Semcos profitability is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Movements of U.S. dollars directly impact Semcos margin, and movements of the Japanese yen may affect Semcos price competitiveness, as most other major MLCC suppliers are based in Japan.MLCCs are a high gross margin business with heavy fixed costs, as it requires massive capital expenditure. Therefore, the impact of MLCC utilization rate on Semcos margin will be relatively large. In general, the company tends to maintain a high utilization rate as long as possible to keep its profitability even in a downturn, which may eventually trigger the inventory correction risks.Semco does not face any material, company-specific environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, which may affect our economic moat and uncertainty ratings. MLCC suppliers particularly pay attention to emission and energy consumption as MLCC production requires a large amount of electricity. Based on Semcos sustainability report, we view the company has been managing emission and energy consumption very well.","Our Capital Allocation Rating for Semco is Standard.Semcos mainstay product, multilayer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs, requires heavy investment, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process. Manufacturers stack hundreds to thousands of layers of ceramic sheets and sinter them at temperatures of 1,000 degrees or even higher, and top suppliers produce billions of MLCCs per month. In fact, Semco has been using 15%-20% of revenue for capital expenditure over the past five years. Given the high gross margin and high cyclicality of the business, MLCC suppliers tend to pay attention to maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As a result, Semcos average dividend payout ratio over the past three years has been around 15%, which is relatively low but understandable.We forecast Semcos operating margin for the next five years to be in the midteens after dropping to 10.3% in 2023 due to the inventory correction, which is close to the historical peak, as the company decided to shut down the unprofitable communication module and rigid-flex printed circuit board, or RF PCB, businesses. Meanwhile, we expect only a slight improvement in its dividend payout ratio for the next five years, as Semco will continue with aggressive investments in MLCCs and FC-BGA to satisfy the robust demand. We believe it makes sense to focus resources on moaty businesses and dispatch less-competitive businesses.","Samsung Electro-Mechanics, or Semco, manufactures various electronic components. The company operates three major segments; component solution, module solution, and substrate solution, and its main products are multilayer ceramic capacitors, or MLCCs, camera modules, semiconductor packages, and printed circuit boards. Semco is the global second MLCC supplier. Samsung Electronics, one of the largest consumer electronics and semiconductor companies, is Semco's largest shareholder.","Semcos balance sheet is sound and not highly leveraged. MLCC production requires heavy capital expenditure and the suppliers profitability is highly influenced by the utilization rate. Therefore, a healthy balance sheet and solid and steady cash flow are necessary for the supplier to continue investing. From this point of view, we are encouraged that Semcos net debt/EBITDA improved to 0.18 times in 2020 from 2.38 times in 2016, as Semco has succeeded in improving its profitability by dispatching unprofitable businesses.",009150.KS,Technology,10741476229120.0,KSC,232460.0,KRW,138200.0,True,1,138991.16820987655,143554.30703125,1
25/11/2023,Atlas Arteria Recovery Is Well Underway as Traffic Returns to Normal in France,Atlas Arteria Ltd,ALX,3,29/09/2023,Adrian Atkins,5.7,AUD,24/11/2023,5.85,Medium,Narrow,Standard,,29/09/2023,"We downgraded our fair value estimate for narrow-moat-rated Atlas Arteria by 3% in August to incorporate a mooted increase in nonincome tax at core asset APRR in France. That tax has now been proposed and we expect will be approved by French Parliament in late 2023. It is set at 4.6% of revenue above EUR 120 million, which we estimate will increase APRRs nonincome taxes by 42% in 2024, sufficiently close to our prior assumption of 50%. We maintain our AUD 5.85 per security fair value estimate, which includes a AUD 0.50 takeover premium given likely interest from IFM Investors. Atlas Arteria has had a poor year. From a literal and figurative high in mid-2022 when it was being stalked by IFM north of AUD 8 per security, its price has collapsed by more than 30% on a mix of external factors including rising bond yields and new taxes, and mis-steps including a discounted equity raising and overpriced acquisition. We think it's now trading around fair value, offering a big yield of 7% balanced by a short average concession life and with risks from the highly leveraged and poorly performing Dulles Greenway. According to its concession agreement, APRR is to be compensated for any new toll road-specific taxes, but by broadening the tax to cover other transport infrastructure like airports, the government believes it can raise taxes on toll roads without triggering compensation. We expect APRR to explore legal options but ultimately to accept higher nonincome taxes, which are unlikely to be deductible for income tax purposes. Distributions of AUD 0.40 per security are likely to exceed underlying free cash flow by about 10% in 2023 because of the dilutive 2022 equity raising. But we expect the gap to close within a couple of years despite rising tax and interest expense.",We forecast distributions to investors grow at a low-single-digit percentage on CPI-linked tariffs at APRR. APRR is a good quality asset. Revenue is defensive and earnings have a positive long term outlook. Dulles Greenway and Chicago Skyway add longer-term value. Toll roads are in high demand from pension funds and other large investors searching for yield. The two best roads could potentially be sold for high prices. ,"While distributions should grow in the medium term, Atlas must repay APRR debt before losing the asset in 2035.  While the best in Atlas Arteria's stable, APRR is less attractive than many other toll roads because of its relatively short concession life, high ongoing capital expenditure, and subdued organic revenue growth. Distributions are expected to exceed underlying free cash flows for the medium term.",31/08/2023,"Atlas Arteria is a global toll-road group. By far its most valuable asset is a 31% stake in Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone. Despite APRR's dominant motorway network in eastern France, the short concession life, high base capital expenditure requirements and subdued organic growth make it less attractive than some motorways. Longer-term distribution growth is likely to be held back by higher interest rates and, from the mid-2020s, the need to pay off all debt at APRR before handing the motorway concession back to the government in 2035. After the APRR concession ends, Atlas Arterias distributions will fall by two thirds to a level supported by the smaller Dulles Greenway and Chicago Skyway. APRR is one of the largest tolled motorway groups in Europe. Concessions covering its main network end on Nov. 30, 2035, and on the smaller AREA network on Sept. 30, 2036. These concessions are relatively short compared with those for other listed toll-road operators. When the concessions end, the roads are returned to the government for no consideration and after repaying all debt. The APRR concessions set base toll increases at 70% of the consumer price index, or CPI, excluding tobacco, and set a base level of maintenance and upgrade capital expenditure of about EUR 200 million per year. Atlas Arteria also owns 100% of Dulles Greenway and 66.67% of Chicago Skyway. Along with high debt levels, the main issue for Greenway is weak traffic volumes following the pandemic and as competing roads have been upgraded. After failing debt service coverage tests in recent years, Greenway is not allowed to pay distributions to investors. The Skyway also suffers from weak traffic volume growth, but tolls increase relatively quickly and its balance sheet is sound.  Atlas also owns the Warnow Tunnel in Germany, but it is tiny, contributing 1% of proportional EBITDA. ","We believe Atlas Arteria has a narrow economic moat underpinned by efficient scale. Its most valuable investment is a 31% stake in Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone, or APRR, which owns a concession over the main tolled motorway network in eastern France. Atlas also owns the concessions to Dulles Greenway and Chicago Skyway in the U.S. For toll roads, new entrants are deterred by inelastic demand and substantial upfront construction costs. A difficulty in securing land and planning permission further deter new entrants. We also believe the roads benefit from a form of switching cost due to time savings compared with non-tolled alternative roads. We estimate the time saving between Paris and Lyon is around two hours, or 30%, compared with the non-tolled alternative route. A relatively short concession life of 12 years for APRR precludes a wide moat. APRR is a large, hard-to-replicate motorway network with relatively defensive revenue. Trade and tourism are key drivers of traffic volumes, which tend to grow slightly faster than real GDP. Toll prices follow a set path--base increases of 0.7% of CPI excluding tobacco. Upgrades to the roads such as adding extra lanes to alleviate traffic congestion are negotiated with the government in return for additional toll price increases or concession extension. Upgrades generally provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. Supplemental toll increases to compensate for higher land tax, the 2015 toll freeze, and additional capital expenditure will see tolls grow slightly faster than CPI for the next few years. If new contracts on fair terms can't be agreed with the government, tolls and capital expenditure revert to the base schedule. French CPI is currently subdued, resulting in weak toll-price growth. Generally, the main risk toll road projects face is inaccurate traffic forecasts, but this is relatively low for upgrades given the roads are already established and traffic patterns well known. Additionally, returns for upgrades are typically good given the monopoly position in negotiating upgrades to its roads. The main APRR concession ends in late 2035, while the concession over the alpine part of the network ends in 2036. The wholly owned Dulles Greenway in the Greater Washington Area is a troubled asset, with weak traffic volumes and too much debt. We think it requires major improvement in traffic volumes or large toll increases to avoid trouble with lenders. Toll price growth is negotiated each year with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, likely negating the potential to earn excess returns. The SCC considers three factors when setting toll prices: are tolls reasonable in relation to the benefit obtained; will toll prices materially discourage use of the road; and will tolls provide no more than a reasonable return for the owner. The 66.67%-owned Chicago Skyway has a very long concession to 2104 and attractive toll uplifts of greater than 2%, CPI and nominal U.S. GDP per capita. The main negative is that it is a mature road and traffic volumes are trending flat to down. The Skyway is an 8-mile road that provides a shortcut from Chicago to Indiana, saving drivers an average of 20 minutes at peak times according to Atlas Arteria. But it is expensive--tolls are close to USD 6 for cars and an average of 5 times higher for trucks, depending on the number of axles. There are untolled alternatives, and these are likely to become more popular as Skyway's tolls accelerate from already high levels. Atlas Arteria's environmental, social, and governance risk is relatively low and does not impact our view of its moat rating. ","We assign Atlas Arteria a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. While the underlying toll roads are relatively defensive, Atlas Arteria has several key risks to consider. Toll roads are capital-intensive and typically require ongoing access to debt markets. This makes them more vulnerable to potential credit crises and economic downturns. Potential deterioration of credit markets could make it more expensive and difficult to borrow, particularly longer-dated debt. There is also the risk of weak economic conditions depressing toll increases and traffic volumes. France is running large budget deficits and could require higher taxes, particularly as interest rates have risen. Corporations are likely to prove easier targets for tax increases than the voting populace. Atlas Arteria's complex corporate and financial structure and minority stake in the main asset also add uncertainty. Atlas Arteria's ESG risks primarily relate to community relations and carbon emissions of motorway users. Roadworks for upgrades and new developments can cause temporary traffic congestion and damage nearby buildings, infrastructure and ecosystems. But we consider these risks to be low. Toll increases are unpopular with the community. This isnt a major risk for APRR as its tolls are linked to CPI, but the Greenway must apply to the regulator for toll increases. Carbon taxes or restrictions on fossil fuels could reduce motorway usage but this would likely require significant improvement in public transport. We think it is more likely for growth in electric cars--as they become more affordable--to offset. Additionally, motorways are typically more environmentally friendly than other roads because cars are forced to brake and accelerate less.","We assign Atlas Arteria a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distributions. This view is mainly based on APRR, which represents the majority of Atlas Arteria's valuation.Atlas' balance sheet is sound. Traffic volumes and earnings were hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns, but Europe has recovered and the U.S. shouldn't be far behind. Normally, Atlas' earnings are defensive, allowing it to carry high levels of debt. In the next three years, we forecast net debt/EBITDA averaging 3.5 times for core asset APRR, including holding company debt, which is conservative. A relatively long debt maturity profile also helps. Smaller asset Dulles Greenway is very highly geared, with net debt/EBITDA around 16 times, but at least debt is nonrecourse and the road has no refinancing requirements. We rate investment efficacy as fair. APRR is required by its concession to spend about EUR 200 million per year maintaining its road network. In return, it can increase tolls by 70% of CPI-ex tobacco inflation. Upgrades, such as road widening, new onramps/offramps and extensions are negotiated with the government and typically result in additional toll-price increases or small concession extensions. These projects typically provide good risk-adjusted returns given the firm's strong bargaining position, but the scope of projects is limited. More significant capital is likely to be invested in buying new assets as the firm tries to diversify away from the short-life APRR. Acquisitions are likely to be value-neutral, given synergies with the existing portfolio are unlikely. We think the recent Chicago Skyway acquisition diluted value. Shareholder distributions are appropriate. APRR pays out all net profit after tax as dividends--it is forbidden by law from paying out more. This is relatively conservative considering it generates strong free cash flows, ensuring asset-level financial leverage remains conservative. Dividends received from APRR cover financing costs at the Eiffarie holding company and operating costs at the Atlas Arteria head office, with the remainder passed through to Atlas investors. The Dulles Greenway is unable to pay dividends until credit metrics improve. Share buybacks are unlikely as any excess capital is likely to be invested in existing and new assets.","Atlas Arteria is a global toll-road investor created out of the reorganisation of Macquarie Infrastructure Group in 2010. The firm's main asset is a 31.1% stake in Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone, or APRR. APRR owns concessions to toll more than 2,300 kilometres of motorways in eastern France, most ending late 2035. The firm also wholly owns the Dulles Greenway and 66.7% of the Chicago Skyway, both in the U.S.","Atlas Arteria is in sound financial health. Net debt/EBITDA for APRR, including holding company debt, was 3.7 times at June 2023 and we expect it to fall to 3 by 2027 as earnings continue to grow. We forecast margin expansion going forward, underpinned by projected toll increases and traffic volumes, while operating costs are likely to be well-contained. The main debt covenant limit is net debt/EBITDA of 7.0 times. This should prove adequate headroom. Interest rates on more than 80% of debt are fixed or hedged for life. We estimate the APRR Group has a weighted average debt maturity of around five years. This fairly long debt maturity profile reduces refinancing risk. The best of Atlass remaining assets is the Chicago Skyway, which has reasonable net debt/EBITDA of 13 times. Dulles Greenway had net debt/EBITDA of 16 times in June 2023. While leverage is very high, it probably wont prove fatal thanks to the roads very long term, fixed rate debt, which means the company has no refinancing requirements and no interest-rate risk. Nonetheless it is unable to pay dividends to Atlas until debt service coverage (EBITDA/total debt service) improves. Debt service coverage was 0.77 times in December 2022, well below the 1.25 times threshold required to reinstate dividends. As coverage fell below 1.15 times, the road is barred from paying dividends for a minimum of three years. With poor traffic volumes following coronavirus lockdowns and upgrades to competing roads, Greenways debt service coverage is unlikely to improve to the point that it can start paying dividends until at least 2026.

24/11/2023,Endava Is a Fast-Growing Leader in Digital Transformation Services,Endava PLC,DAVA,3,20/11/2023,Rob Hales,65.64,USD,23/11/2023,77.0,High,Narrow,Standard,B,20/11/2023,"We're initiating coverage on two narrow-moat information technology services companies that specialize in digital transformation services. We think narrow-moat Globant is fairly valued with a $201 fair value estimate. In contrast, we think narrow-moat Endava is undervalued with a $77 fair value estimate, which puts the stock in 4-star territory. Endava is enduring a larger growth downturn than Globant in the current challenging environment given its high exposure to private equity, which we think has caused investors with a short investment horizon to sell the stock. Globant and Endava both specialize in the high-value, high-growth area of digital transformation services. Digital transformation projects are typically unstructured with murky goals at the outset. Indeed, clients usually don't know exactly what they want. Globant and Endava serve this need by providing a blend of consulting, traditional IT services, and digital advertising capabilities to their clients. The companies differ from traditional IT service companies by utilizing an agile project-management system, which maximizes innovation and flexibility, and nearshoring (that is, in the same time zone) employees close to clients given continuous interaction is critical for successful delivery of these projects. Comparing the two companies, Globant is larger, more focused on North America, and has a more diverse client base, although clients are still relatively concentrated in financial services and media and entertainment. Endava is more exposed to the U.K. and Europe and is more concentrated in financial services, particularly payments and private equity.","Endava specializes in digital transformation services, which is one of the fastest-growing areas in the IT services market. The companys land-and-expand strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the increasing average spending of its top-10 clients.  Endavas expertise in payments should be transferable to clients in industries that need similar services such as retail, automotive, and healthcare providers.",High growth expectations for digital transformation services is attracting new competition from big and small players.  Endava has limited ability to increase margins given the low operating leverage in its business model. Endavas revenue base is concentrated in the U.K. and continental Europe and in the financial services (particularly payments and private equity) and TMT industries.,20/11/2023,"Endava, based in the U.K., is an IT services company focused on providing digital transformation and engineering services. It generates revenue mainly by charging clients on a time and materials basis for services such as consulting/advice, customized software development and integration, and quality assurance and testing. Endava is highly exposed to the financial services sector, with nearly half of its revenue generated from the sector. Within financial services, Endava is known for its expertise in payments and private equity.  Like many of its peers, Endavas core strategy is to land and expand, which means securing big clients and growing revenue in those relationships by increasingly providing these clients more services. Endavas 10-largest clients account for around a third of group revenue with the largest, Mastercard, contributing around 10%. Mastercard has been a client for over 20 years. Endava concentrates on the financial services and technology, media, and telecom industries. The company aims to diversify its industry exposure by securing new clients from new verticals. In particular, Endava is targeting clients in retail and healthcare given its current expertise is most transferrable to these areas.  Similarly, Endava is geographically concentrated with around 40% of revenue generated in the U.K. and around 20% generated in continental Europe. To diversify, Endava is primarily growing its business in North America.  Endavas delivery model is based on agile project management from employees in nearshore locations, which it plans to expand. To best serve its clients' unique digital transformation goals, the flexibility from the iterative nature of agile project management is effective. Furthermore, the nonstandardized nature of these projects requires constant dialogue and interaction between Endava and its clients, which means having delivery teams with similar time zones to its clients (nearshoring) is best to deliver the project successfully in a timely manner. Endava is striving to achieve a maintainable organic revenue growth rate of around 20% with a relatively stable adjusted-profit-before-tax margin of 20%.","We think Endava has a narrow moat based on switching costs. The companys historical return on invested capital, including goodwill, has typically been in the 20%-30% range. We expect Endavas ROIC to be relatively stable in the low 20s in our forecast period despite our expectation for strong revenue growth due to a relatively low level of operating leverage in the business.The IT services industry is highly fragmented. According to Statista, the global IT services market has a value of around $1.1 trillion. Even the largest players like Accenture, Tata Consultancy, and Capgemini would typically only have a low-single-digit market share. Endava, with less than $1 billion in revenue, has less than 1% market share. We consider Endava, along with EPAM Systems and Globant to be leaders in the attractive niche of digital transformation services. We think these companies typically have more of a consulting role with their clients and a larger focus on engineering services to help their clients build new products and serve their own clients (that is, to generate revenue) using new technologies compared with traditional IT service providers who are experts in legacy technologies and are focused on commoditized development, integration, and maintenance engagements where cost is key (that is, to save costs). We think switching costs are based on time investment, risk-aversion, mission-criticality, and multiple customer touchpoints. Endava undertakes customized, highly interactive work engagements for its clients. Accordingly, the relationship typically starts small and grows over time as trust and familiarity are established. Once Endava solidifies this trust as a capable business partner and digital strategic consultant, the additional time and disruption needed for customers to be confident in an alternative provider is a significant deterrent to switching. Most companies consider digital transformation of their operations as mission-critical now. Endava asserts that 90% of its revenue is generated from existing clients, implying an average customer life span of 10 years, which supports our narrow moat rating. The vast majority of Endavas clients are large enterprises, which by their very nature are stickier relationships given the inherent complexity of their operations and propensity for risk aversion. Endava, like its peers, typically has a land and expand strategy where it primarily tries to increase its business with current customers by offering them services in varying parts of its operations. This creates multiple touchpoints in a customers operations that lead to increased switching costs. Indeed, Endava actively eschews small clients that do not have the potential to grow to a meaningful level.We think Endava differentiates from traditional IT service providers through its strategy of agile project management (versus waterfall) and nearshoring of its employees (versus offshoring to India), which support its moat by deepening customer relationships as the company becomes a trusted advisor that brings a clients strategic digital goals to fruition. Endavas business model is designed to help customers figure out a path to take on their digital journey. Indeed, most customers dont know exactly what they want. Agile project management allows this process to move incrementally, adjust for feedback along the way, and pivot in a completely different direction midstream, if necessary. In contrast, waterfall project management is a more linear and less flexible approach, which is better suited to standardized projects (that is, common cost-saving projects on legacy infrastructure). In order for agile project management to be successful, continuous interaction between Endava and its clients is necessary, which is why Endava asserts nearshoring its employees is essential so that Endavas employees and its clients are in nearly the same time zone. This is why nearly half of its employees are based in the European Union, particularly Romania, to support its clients, primarily in Europe. Endava typically contracts with its customers via a multiyear master services agreement. This agreement spells out the framework of the relationship, but generally does not include any monetary commitments to a certain amount of work. Actual work projects typically last 6-18 months. During a work project, the chance of a client switching providers is slim to none, given the disruption it would cause. However, upon completion the software and intellectual property is owned by the client and, in theory, Endava could be replaced by a cheaper competitor providing only a maintenance-type service. However, typically there is always another upgrade or enhancement of the original project to be undertaken. As long as the customer is satisfied with Endavas work, switching providers is rare given the familiarity and trust built with Endava and the accumulated knowledge Endava has developed with the customers IT systems. Therefore, clients have limited motivation to switch providers due to the additional time and effort it would require to get a new provider up to speed. We think Endava has industry expertise that supports its switching costs as the company is viewed as an industry leader in certain verticals. Consequently, customers in these verticals may doubt that a better outcome could be achieved with a different provider. Around half of Endavas revenue is generated from clients in the payments and financial services sector and nearly a quarter is generated in technology, media, and telecom. While many IT service companies have high exposure to financial services, Endava is notably a leader in payments and private equity. Its largest client, Mastercard, is in payments. Mastercard has been a client for many years and now accounts for more than 10% of revenue. Endavas expertise in the private equity sector has led that vertical to account for around 20% of total revenue.","Endava has a High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, given its high sales growth expectations can lead to dramatic moves in the stock price when market expectations change modestly. IT services is a cyclical industry and Endava is more cyclical than the larger, traditional firms given its geographical and industry concentration. Specifically, most of Endavas revenue is generated in the U.K. and continental Europe and most of its customers are in the financial services and TMT industries. Within financial services, Endava is particularly exposed to payments and private equity. Digital transformation services have more of a discretionary nature compared with some traditional services like business process outsourcing, but we think demand for digital transformation services is becoming more resilient as clients consider this mission-critical.Despite the implied cyclicality, Endavas margins historically have been quite stable with an increasing trend over time as the company has limited operating leverage given its primary cost is labor and it charges its clients on a time-and-materials basis for services. Consequently, our cash flow forecast is primarily driven by our sales growth forecast. Our Uncertainty Rating considers the increasing complexity of enterprise IT and the risks of falling behind in such capabilities, as well as perception risk that could cause distrust in the companys offerings, brought upon by an event that compromises security, which is not uncommon in the industry. Yet, we do not foresee any material environmental, social, or governance issues on the horizon.Like most IT services companies, Endava is at risk of employee attrition given its employees are its primary asset and value generator. A high attrition rate can prevent an IT services company from capturing all growth opportunities due to staff shortages while also impeding operational efficiency due to increased resources being dedicated to training and maintaining institutional knowledge. ","We assign Endava a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating. In our opinion, this rating reflects a sound balance sheet, fair investment efficacy, and appropriate shareholder distribution policies. The company typically maintains a net cash position on its balance sheet with debt primarily related to lease liabilities.Endava regularly acquires businesses as part of its growth plan, but historically they have largely been small bolt-on deals with minimal financial disclosure, which makes assessment challenging. Endava uses acquisitions primarily to enhance its expertise in new technologies and verticals and to diversify geographically. Endava has continuously generated strong growth and a healthy ROIC historically, so we assume its acquisitions have generally been strategically sound and accretive to value. The company does not pay dividends or buy back shares in meaningful amounts. This is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. We think this is reasonable given Endava continues to have a large organic growth opportunity ahead. Endava has a dual-class share structure where Class B shares (mainly owned by management) have 10 times the voting power of the Class A shares. As of Aug. 15, Class B shareholders controlled 78.3% of the voting rights of the company including 43.5% controlled by CEO John Cotterell. Consequently, Class A shareholders have limited ability to influence corporate matters. ","Endava is a next-generation IT services company that primarily assists clients with their digital transformation efforts by creating customized software for them. The company was founded in 2006 in the U.K. and it continues to generate the majority of revenue in the U.K. and Europe. Endavas client base is concentrated in the payments and financial services, technology, media, and telecom industries. ","Endavas financial condition is solid. IT services is a capital-light business as its major expense is labor, which means operating leverage is fairly low. The company has maintained a net cash position for several years with little debt on the balance sheet.

24/11/2023,Stellantis Benefits From Scale and Manufacturing Efficiencies as Merger Integration Progresses,Stellantis NV,STLA,5,31/10/2023,Richard Hilgert,20.14,USD,23/11/2023,41.0,High,,Standard,,31/10/2023,"No-moat-rated Stellantis reported third-quarter revenue of EUR 45.1 billion, rising 7% from EUR 42.1 billion reported in the prior year, despite the UAW strike. Excluding unfavorable currency, organic revenue rose 14%. The top line beat the FactSet consensus estimate of EUR 43.3 billion by 4%. Stellantis did not give specific figures for the third-quarter impact but did say that the UAW strike resulted in 50,000 lost units for a EUR 3 billion revenue hit and cost less than EUR 750 million in adjusted operating income, cumulatively for September and October. Even though headwinds continue to be substantial, we were impressed that organic revenue growth outpaced volume growth by 3 percentage points as pricing, mix, and volume supported the revenue increase. The automaker (French-domiciled for accounting purposes) discloses only revenue in the first and third quarters. Managements largely unchanged 2023 guidance reflects slightly improved volumes above prior guidance in most of its regions, partially offset by lower volumes in South America, and the UAW labor stoppage. The firm forecasts double-digit adjusted operating income margin and positive free cash flow. The CFO commented about margin on the third-quarter call, saying that momentum should be positive through the second half as cost mitigation efforts partially offset strike impact. We estimate 2023 revenue of EUR 184 billion and an AOI margin of 13.3%, which assumes a 12.1% second-half AOI margin, up a hair from 12.0% last year. We remind investors that ratification votes still need to be taken by the UAW for U.S. workers and Unifor for Canadian hourly workers and we remain concerned about economic softness in major auto markets, geopolitical turmoil, supply chain disruption, and inflationary cost pressures. The 5-star-rated shares of Stellantis on Oct. 31 traded at a compelling 55% discount to our unchanged EUR 39 fair value estimate.","Merger integration enhances economies of scale. In 2022, management achieved cash flow synergy targets two years ahead of schedule. Low global light-vehicle inventory due to COVID-19 and the microchip shortage has strengthened the current pricing environment, which should enhance margin in the near term. Global expansion of premium brands like Alfa Romeo, DS, Jeep, and Maserati strengthens average revenue per unit and improves profitability.","Stellantis lags competitors progress in transition to EVs as Fiat Chrysler required the purchase of carbon credits to avoid clean air regulation noncompliance fines due to slow EV development. However, merging with Peugeot has accelerated Fiat Chrysler EV development. The global auto industry suffers from overcapacity that increases pricing pressure, in turn limiting economic profits in the long run. Fiat Chrysler failed to grow its premium Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands. Under new Stellantis leadership with Carlos Tavares as CEO, these storied brands may yet have new life.",31/10/2023,"Stellantis was formed by the merger of Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler, which closed on Jan. 16, 2021. In 2022, chip crisis-affected total unit volume was 6.0 million, while revenue and adjusted operating income were EUR 179.6 billion and EUR 23.3 billion, respectively. Unit sales volume in 2022 makes Stellantis the fifth-largest global automaker behind Toyota at 10.3 million, Volkswagen at 8.0 million, Hyundai/Kia at 6.8 million, and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance at 6.4 million. Management had targeted about EUR 5.0 billion in annual run-rate cash flow synergies from the merger, 80% of which to be realized by the end of 2024 on a one-time cost estimated at EUR 4.0 billion. Seventy-five percent of the synergies were targeted for technology, platform and product convergences, optimizing research and development investment and manufacturing processes, plus procurement; while all other functions like logistics, supply chain management, quality, and aftermarket account for 18%; and 7% from selling, general, and administrative. However, management has said that, as of the end of 2022, the firm has already achieved EUR 7.1 billion in cash flow synergies, exceeding the original target two years ahead of schedule. We expect additional synergies to emerge during the next three years. Because it takes between 18 months and three years to develop and launch a new vehicle, widespread adoption of common vehicle architectures and parts across Stellantis' product portfolio has yet to occur. Stellantis' Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan sets targets for electrification, revenue, and profitability. In 2022, the firm had 23 battery electric vehicle nameplates and sold a total of 228,000 BEVs. Stellantis targets 75 BEV nameplates and 5 million BEV sales volume by 2030, of which management aims for 100% BEV mix of EU passenger vehicle sales and 50% BEV mix of U.S. passenger car and light-duty truck sales. Management targets EUR 300 billion in 2030 revenue while maintaining double-digit adjusted operating margin during the plan period. While we are skeptical of Stellantis' revenue and margin targets, we expect greatly improved results from merger integration. ","We have assigned Stellantis a no-moat rating. In general, automotive manufacturers are no-moat companies that participate in a highly competitive industry and make products that are easily substitutable by consumers. Automakers are capital-intensive, causing significant swings in economic profitability on relatively moderate changes in demand, and they experience cyclicality that can destroy economic value for a year or more. Even though the automobile is a modern-day technological marvel that requires enormous engineering talent, complex software coding, considerable regulatory compliance, and immense organizational skill to design, develop, and bring to market, substantial global industry overcapacity (41 million units excess capacity of 124 million units 2021 global light-vehicle capacity according to IHS Markit) would seem to indicate limited barriers to entry despite substantial capital requirements as well as complex regulatory safety and emissions compliance.Given the industry's highly competitive nature, mass-market manufacturers must consistently and frequently execute in design and development of both product and assembly process. Owing to the competitive landscape, we liken auto sector companies to a swimmer who vigorously treads water with an extra 50 kilograms tied around his waist. That extra 50 kilograms of weight results from substantial light-vehicle overcapacity with only roughly 75% to 80% peak utilization worldwide. As soon as the swimmer stops treading, he immediately finds himself frantically struggling just to get back up to the surface.Hard-fought market share is won, and temporary economic profits are achieved by three typical routes. First, automakers seek to introduce a radically new design that defines a new vehicle niche (Chrysler's introduction of the minivan in the 1980s and Toyotas RAV-4 crossover in the 1990s). Second, original-equipment manufacturers race to be the first to market a dramatically differentiated technology (Toyota's introduction of the Prius hybrid in the early 2000s and Teslas electric vehicles in the late 2000s). Finally, some firms maintain a younger product portfolio through frequent new vehicle introductions and substantial redesigns. The Japanese in the 1980s and 1990s had a competitive advantage by cutting their time to market in half relative to other manufacturers.Even though Stellantis enjoys premium pricing with Alfa Romeo, DS, Jeep, and Maserati brands, competitors have been able to achieve the same or better perceived brand value. Wealthier consumers of these products view their vehicles as extensions of themselves and are willing to pay a premium for a machine that exudes a certain image. While Stellantis brands represent premium sportiness, rugged off-road capability, and luxury, consumers can easily switch to competitors' vehicles like Audi, Bentley, BMW, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, or Rolls-Royce. In price-conscious, high-volume markets, fickle consumers can switch among competing brands, and quite often, they do. The latest fads, hottest styles, coolest technologies, high-profile recalls, cost of financing, trade-in value, high dependability ratings from consumer publications, and utilitarian needs can all influence consumers' buying decisions. For penny-pinching educated shoppers, dependable transportation at an affordable price is all that's required, and it doesn't matter which manufacturer's vehicle they buy, just as long as it's the best deal they can find. In this instance, consumers can easily switch from Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Fiat, Opel, or Peugeot to Buick, Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Renault, Skoda, Toyota, or Volkswagen, then back again.","Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Stellantis is High. The companys risks include cyclical global light-vehicle demand, merger integration execution risk, volatile commodity costs, and a unionized workforce. While the merger is geographically complementary, with exposure to differing countries in Europe (Peugeot in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom plus Fiat in Italy) as well as a major presence in North America and South America (Peugeot is strong in Argentina, while Fiat has one of the top market shares in Brazil), the two companies have been unsuccessful in penetrating China.Stellantis has some exposure to environmental, social, and governance risk, which we include in our high uncertainty rating. The firm is transitioning to electric vehicles from greenhouse gas emitting internal combustion engines. While the company sells EVs, ICE vehicles will likely still be sold for at least the next decade. All automakers' vehicles have product governance risk exposure from potential recalls, ICE vehicles risk compliance with clean air regulations, and the risk of compliance with governments' safety regulations. Stellantis' products are highly engineered, requiring the company to attract and retain software and engineering experts. Business ethics risk stems from Stellantis' involvement in diesel emissions cheating, which the company has denied. The business controversies add to Stellantis' corporate governance risks that also include: the chairman, CEO, senior independent director initially holding five-year terms while board members initially hold four-year terms but thereafter all members are elected to two-year terms; voting rights are differentiated by duration of ownership after three years (loyalty voting structure); Exor controlled by John Elkann (chairman) owns 13.99%, the Peugeot family (Robert Peugeot is vice chairman of the board) owns 6.98%, and the French state owns 6.0%; however, Stellantis' board has a director dedicated to ESG oversight.","We assign Stellantis a Standard Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our assessment of a sound balance sheet, fair investment, and poor shareholder distributions. We think reinvestment in the business is the most likely key driver of total shareholder returns. At a normalized midcycle, we estimate that Stellantis' return on invested capital is 1.3 percentage points below its 9.8% weighted average cost of capital, but in 2022, ROIC exceeded WACC by 9.8 percentage points.The balance sheet is sound, with pro forma net debt/EBITDA averaging negative 0.4 times (a net cash position) and a net debt/total capital ratio averaging negative 11.0% (also a net cash position) since 2015. We expect the balance sheet to remain sound and estimate three-year forward average net debt/EBITDA and net debt/total capital of negative 1.0 times and negative 21.4%, respectively. Since 2015, pro forma Stellantis' shareholder distributions have been low, with dividends being paid in only four of the last seven years as the predecessors focused on reducing debt.Peugeot paid stock dividends in 2017-19 averaging a 24% payout ratio, and Fiat Chrysler paid a regular dividend in 2019 with a 28% payout ratio. However, including a special dividend from Fiat Chrysler's sale of Magneti Marelli, the total 2019 payout ratio was 84%. In 2022, the firm repurchased EUR 883 million in stock net of shares issued to fund employee stock ownership programs. In February 2023, the board of directors authorized a EUR 1.5 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2023. Management targets a 25% to 30% dividend payout ratio and to repurchase up to 5% of outstanding shares through 2025. While this may change our future shareholder distributions assessment from poor to mixed or even fair (if Stellantis maintains consistent dividend payout ratios), it would unlikely change our overall Standard capital allocation rating.Stellantis is 13.99% owned by Exor NV, which is in turn controlled by Giovanni Agnelli BV, the Agnelli family investment firm. John Elkann, Stellantis NV, Giovanni Agnelli BV, and Exor NV chairman, and Andrea Agnelli, a director on Stellantis', Giovanni Agnelli's, and Exor's boards, are great-great-grandsons of Fiat founder, Giovanni Agnelli. Etablissements Peugeot Freres SA, the Peugeot family investment company, owns 6.98% of Stellantis and Robert Peugeot is vice chairman of the board. Through Bpifrance Participations SA, the French government owns 6.0% of Stellantis, represented by Nicolas Dufourcq on the board of directors. Stellantis has a loyalty voting program whereby shareholders owning shares for three years are eligible for an extra voting right through a special voting share, without entitling the shareholders to additional economic rights. Ordinary shares listed in the loyalty registry are blocked from trading. We expect the Agnelli and Peugeot families to register for the loyalty voting shares, increasing their voting control of Stellantis.The Stellantis board of directors consists of 11 members, including CEO Carlos Tavares. Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot nominated two independent directors and one labor representative, respectively. Exor nominated two directors, while EPF and BPI nominated one director, each. We would prefer to see a majority of independents on the board. Additionally, the French government has the potential to interfere on behalf of labor unions in collaboration with employee board representatives, restricting the company's ability to pursue truly beneficial restructuring.As of Feb. 20, 2014, Tavares took over PSA Peugeot Citroen's operations and as of March 31, 2014, he took over from Philippe Varin as president of the group's managing board. Varin had been in these positions since June 2009. Before joining Peugeot, Tavares was with Renault since 1981, serving in progressively greater roles of responsibility across the Renault-Nissan alliance operations. Up until his departure, he was considered the heir apparent to Carlos Ghosn at Renault. His turnaround initiatives have successfully expanded margin, reduced debt, and generated economic profits since 2015. Besides Tavares, there is only one other Stellantis board member with meaningful automotive industry operating experience. However, given the auto industrys digitization trend, it is interesting to note that four board members have tech industry experience.","Stellantis NV was formed on Jan. 16, 2021, from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. The combination of the two companies created the worlds fifth-largest automaker, with 14 automobile brands. In 2022, pro forma Stellantis had sales volume of 6.0 million vehicles and EUR 179.6 billion in revenue, albeit affected by the microchip shortage. Europe is Stellantis' largest market, accounting for 44% of 2022 global volume while North America and South America were 31% and 14%, respectively.","Before the merger and the pandemic, Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot had dramatically reduced their debt leverage, improving their financial strength. Automakers with substantial financial leverage are at a competitive disadvantage, as interest payments detour cash needed to continue product development during cyclical downturns. On a pro forma basis, we calculated that Stellantis total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (takes into consideration operating leases and rent expense) was at 2.5 times in 2015. However, by 2019, that ratio had been reduced to 1.3 times, more in line with investment-grade credit metrics. Netting cash against total adjusted debt, the 2019 ratio would have been negative 0.2 times, indicating a net cash position. However, at the end of 2022, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 1.1 times while net adjusted debt/EBITDAR was negative 0.5 times, again indicating a strong net cash position.At the end of December 2022, Stellantis liquidity was EUR 62.7 billion, including EUR 50.0 billion in cash and EUR 12.7 billion in available credit facility. As part of the merger agreement, Fiat Chrysler shareholders received a special EUR 2.9 billion dividend on Jan. 29, 2021. On March 22, 2021, Stellantis shareholders received a special EUR 308 million cash dividend as part of the spinoff of Faurecia. Then, on April 28, 2021, Stellantis shareholders were paid a EUR 1.0 billion special dividend as part of the combination agreement. The firm's dividend policy targets 25%-30% annual dividend payout ratios. In our view, Stellantis has a healthy liquidity position to weather cyclical downturns while maintaining product development plans and dividends.",STLA,Consumer Cyclical,67548688384.0,NYQ,5437499.0,USD,20.13999938964844,True,1,19.105058827124708,23.924074055235803,1
24/11/2023,Daifuku's Cleanroom and Intralogistics Businesses Facing Headwinds but Expect Recovery in 2024,Daifuku Co Ltd,6383,4,14/11/2023,Jason Kondo,2680.0,JPY,24/11/2023,3500.0,Medium,Wide,Exemplary,,14/11/2023,"We maintain our fair value estimate of Daifuku at JPY 3,500, after adjusting our projection based on the September-quarter results. The warehouse/cleanroom automation space has been facing headwinds, as the total September-quarter orders declined 13% year on year. However, we think orders have bottomed, as this was still a 26% sequential increase. Quarterly orders for the intralogistics, or IL, segment were stronger than expected with a 34% year-on-year increase, compared with negative 37% in the June quarter. While global warehouse automation demand continues to be sluggish, the impact was mitigated by large-scale seasonal renovation/upgrade projects by existing customers in North America and the weak Japanese yen. We maintain our outlook that automation investments will pick up in the first half of fiscal 2024, and project Daifukus revenue to grow 7.4% year on year in 2024 (up from 6.7% previously) after remaining flat in 2023, followed by 6.6% CAGR between 2023 and 2027. We believe the market is underestimating Daifukus medium-term growth potential, driven by secular trends such as the shortage of skilled labor in Japan and the further penetration of warehouse automation in the U.S./Asia. Although the weak global semiconductor investments continue to affect cleanroom orders, we see strong demand in China and a pickup in investments in North America. As a result, the 34% year-on-year decline for September-quarter cleanroom orders was better than the 61% decline in the June quarter. Daifuku has been particularly benefiting from increased investments related to power semiconductors/older-generation chips in China and we expect this to continue. However, we think the larger-scale logic and memory investments by the major foundries/chipmakers would not increase until the second half of fiscal 2024. Over the medium term, we expect demand for high-performance computing and high-end mobile electronics to drive demand for Daifukus cleanroom equipment.","Well positioned to capitalize on semiconductor production growth, as a market leader in high-end cleanroom automation equipment. Its track record and partnership with automating Fast Retailings global distribution operations shows Daifuku is capable of capitalizing on rising e-commerce and warehouse automation demand. Long-term contracts backed by service income (about 25% of total sales) will likely lessen the negative impact on top-line growth and margins during economic downcycles.","A material decline in semiconductor and/or e-commerce investments can significantly affect sales. Lower margins in Daifuku's North America business relative to Japan can present negative regional mix effects to margins, if sales growth in Japan becomes weak. Companywide operating margin is pulled down by lower margin businesses like airport and automobile segments, suggesting need for reorganization.",14/11/2023,"Daifuku is the global market leader in material handling, which involves the automation behind transport, storage, and control of products/materials in factories, cleanrooms for semiconductor production, distribution centers/warehouses, and airports. The company not only adds value to customers as an equipment supplier but also serves as a system integrator providing material handling solutions based on its products, which include automated storage and retrieval systems, pallet racks, conveyors, sorting systems, automated guided vehicles, and software systems that manage the material handling process. Having supplied to market leaders across various industries, including Toyota, TSMC, Intel, Dell, and Fanuc, the company is leveraging its established know-how in material handling into the warehouse/logistics automation market, which is expected to grow backed by rising e-commerce demand. While the global material handling market is relatively consolidated, with the top five players (Daifuku, Dematic, Schaefer, Vanderlande, and Honeywell Intelligrated) holding majority share collectively, the warehouse automation subsegment is more fragmented with low market penetration rates, as it is in the earlier stages of growth. Despite high competition in the growing warehouse automation market, we think Daifuku is well positioned to be competitive to capitalize on secular market growth, as it can apply decades of experience providing tailored automation solutions to various customer facilities. Further, its record of automating Fast Retailings distribution facility in Tokyo as well as its strategic partnership with the company to automate its facilities globally is a clear sign that Daifuku has the capability to compete with other leading players.","We assign Daifuku a wide moat rating, with switching costs and intangible assets as its main moat sources. Since its inception in 1937, the company has focused on material handling, which involves the movement, protection, storage, and control of products/materials within facilities such as factories, distribution centers, and warehouses. Its main businesses are intralogistics (which includes material handling solutions for warehouses and factories), cleanroom production-line systems for foundry operators/semiconductor producers, automobile production systems, and airport technologies (like baggage handling). Daifuku's largest business by sales is the intralogistics segment, which provides material handling solutions comprising automated storage and retrieval system, or AS/RS, pallet racks ranging from a standard storage racks to mobile racks, conveyor and sorting systems, vehicle systems ranging from overhead monorail to automated guided vehicles, software to manage the overall transport process (for example warehouse management systems), and other warehouse/factory automation equipment. With customers looking to automate the material handling aspect of their manufacturing and/or logistics/distribution processes, we believe companies that can tailor customer needs by providing a comprehensive set of equipment and software systems are best positioned maintain their competitiveness. Leading Player in the Global Material Handling MarketSince delivering the first chain conveyor system to Toyota Motor (Japans first passenger automobile factory) in the 1950s, the company has refined its specialty as not only an equipment manufacturer but also a system integrator that provides services ranging from consulting to maintenance, while expanding to other areas like warehouse and cleanroom automation. According to Modern Materials Handling, Daifuku has been ranked as the top worldwide materials handling systems suppliers by revenue for the past seven years, as of year-end 2021, with a 16% share in the overall market.Daifukus main competitors include Schaefer, Honeywell Intelligrated, Dematic, Murata Machinery, and Vanderlande Industries, where these companies together hold the majority of the market share. One key factor that has led to this consolidated market structure was due to high M&A activity in this space. For example, Daifuku acquired several companies in the airport automation space, including U.K.-based Logan Teleflex as well as the Netherlands-based Scarabee Aviation, as part of its efforts to advance into growth markets outside North America and to strengthen its digital solutions for airport business. Other notable M&A by competitors include the acquisition of U.S.-based Intelligrated by wide-moat Honeywell (diversified industrials conglomerate) in 2016, acquisition of U.S.-based Dematic by narrow-moat Kion (manufactures forklifts, warehouse trucks, and so on) in 2016, and acquisition of the Netherlands-based Vanderlande by Toyota Industries (manufactures automotive components and forklifts) in 2017.Daifuku's intralogistics segment is applying decades of accumulated know-how from supplying to numerous customers across a variety of industries, into the growing logistics/warehouse automation market, backed by rising demand in e-commerce. The warehouse automation market exhibits a mix of a consolidated market for larger, global customers/projects with a fragmented market for smaller projects. In China, the foreign players like Daifuku tend to engage in large-scale automation projects (for example, Daifuku supplied its AS/RS to Chinas largest dairy product manufacturer, narrow-moat Yilis distribution center in Hohhot), while the local system integrators are part of a long tail where, on the extreme end, each of the market players has records of two to three small-scale projects per company. As a result of this mixed, long-tailed market structure, the warehouse automation subsegment (particularly in China) is more fragmented than the overall material handling market, where the top five material handling players currently hold only about a third of the global warehouse automation market. Despite this market composition, the leading material handling players continue to hold the top share in the warehouse automation market as well, as they benefit from first-mover advantage and are able to apply their respective material handling technologies as well as implementation know-how to capitalize on growing trends in e-commerce. High Switching Costs Underpin Daifukus Economic MoatWe believe Daifukus moat is underpinned by high switching costs as its material handling equipment tends to be integrated with the manufacturing and/or supply-chain processes and are usually long-term contracts leading to steady service-related income for the supplier (which is about 25% of total revenue for Daifuku). Further, these material handling solutions, which are composed of both hardware and software, tend to be customized and require significant amount of time in the planning stage. For example, according to the companys management, the planning process of airport baggage handling systems take three to four years. The projects require engineers of both suppliers and customers for the planning, implementation, and maintenance to be involved over a long time frame, as the suppliers must develop a thorough understanding of customer facilities and the customers must learn various aspects of the equipment from usage/operations to maintenance. As a result, the mutual learning curve creates significant switching costs for customers as switching vendors would create additional costs from starting the entire process over. Also, with the risks and related costs of unplanned downtime being significant (for example, from damaged goods and reputation in e-commerce, delivery error of checked luggage in airports, improperly made semiconductors, delay in delivery of automobiles, and so on), we expect existing customers will continue to have a strong incentive to keep Daifuku as their material handling equipment supplier over the long term. Intangible Assets: Long-Term Record Backed by Leading TechnologyDaifuku boasts a long-term record with leading companies/institutions in a variety of industries, such as deliveries of: material handling solutions to Toyota Motor, cleanroom equipment to TSMC, advanced FA systems to leading industrial robot manufacturer Fanuc, baggage handling systems to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (including 128 check-ins, conveyors above 10 km in aggregate length, barcode readers, x-ray machines, and so on), picking cart systems to leading Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido, and storage/retrieval systems and case sorters to Dell Technologies. We believe Daifukus long-term record to Toyota Motor is a strong indicator of its intangible assets, as the leading car manufacturers just-in-time lean manufacturing process, which avoids having extra inventory and ensures that parts are taken to a designated department at a specific time, makes any form of production trouble leading to Toyotas production system no longer effective, and thus requires not only material handling equipment with reliable technology but also a strong knowledge of customer processes. As a leading incumbent player, we think Daifukus track record has allowed the company to evolve and gain specific know-how by continuously developing solutions under various conditions, like Toyotas strict quality control and adherence to delivery deadlines, and thus contributing to its reputation of reliability.We think Daifuku's track record to Fast Retailing Co. (Japanese retail holding company with brands like Uniqlo), is a testament to its intangible assets moat source. In 2018, Daifuku and Fast Retailing entered a long-term strategic global partnership to reform and improve Fast Retailings e-commerce/logistics processes, with the aim to build the worlds most advanced automated facilities, where it plans to invest JPY 100 billion in the project over an unspecified time frame and eventually automate all of the companys warehouses globally. Daifuku became a trusted supplier of Fast Retailing initially through the automation of Fast Retailings main warehouse in Ariake, Japan, where the project was historically the largest project for Daifuku and led to realized efficiencies for Fast Retailing, such as tripling its storage efficiency, 90% reduction in labor, shipment productivity of 19 times, and warehousing speed of 80 times (15 minutes from order to shipment at the fastest). Further, after meeting candidate companies worldwide prior to selecting the partner, the founder and President of Fast Retailing, Tadashi Yanai, described Daifuku as the most reliable and mentioned that only Daifuku can do this (strategic partnership) together until the end. Wide vs. Narrow MoatWe believe Daifuku warrants a wide moat. Minimization of unplanned downtime will likely continue being one of the largest supply-side issues for the companys customers over the long-term, which serves as a strong foundation to its moat sources, and its high switching costs and intangible assets have a strong reinforcing effect on each other. Similar to the main products produced by its wide-moat factory automation peers, Daifukus factory, distribution, and airport automation products are highly integrated into the facilities they are supplied to, as they tend to be sold as packaged sets of equipment and software that work together throughout the material handling portion of the supply chain process (from warehousing/storing to shipment for logistics systems) or baggage handling process in the case of airports (from automatic check-in to the transport of goods to the respective flights through the conveyor systems). Also, to avoid unplanned downtime, we expect existing and potential customers (especially those planning to undergo complex, large-scale projects) will minimize any form of risks on avoiding downtime by preferring suppliers with a proven long-term track record and other intangible assets, as they are aware that costs from equipment malfunction as well as switching suppliers can be significant. Further, we think the after-market revenue coming from the long-term equipment life that can go above 20 years solidify Daifukus moat. Daifukus strong technology and implementation know-how as system integrators, from having supplied to numerous major companies in their respective industries, will likely be significant contributors to its ability to generate excess economic profits over the long-term, especially as production and distribution processes of customers become more complex, due to trends related to Internet of Things connectivity as well as increasing sophistication of manufactured goods. For example, in the semiconductor FA space, the company has supplied its equipment to major manufacturers, such as TSMC, and we expect significant technological hurdles in material handling equipment to continue existing. Cleanrooms for semiconductors must be kept cleaned (as the name implies) to keep contaminants away and prevent defects in the semiconductors, so the material handling equipment must be able to prevent generating dust. The equipment requires high durability as the facilities tend to run 24/7 and with semiconductors becoming increasingly miniaturized, they must be handled carefully, with low vibration levels. All of this must be done under tight production deadlines, while transporting on overhead rail tracks that can be long as 10 km in aggregate length in larger facilities. We project Daifukus average adjusted ROIC to increase to about 22% in 2027 from 17.5% in 2022, which is well above its weighted average cost of capital of 7.9%. Environmental, Social, and Governance RisksWe do not think Daifuku faces any material, company-specific ESG risks that may affect its economic moat or uncertainty ratings. Similar to all industrial equipment/component companies, the company is exposed to risks related to product control and safety. Product safety issues in FA equipment include accidents related to programming, electricity control, sensors, hardware deterioration, operation errors, and so forth. Further, poor ESG risk management can lead to direct and indirect costs related to intellectual property, data security from the increasing influence of the Internet of Things, environmental issues, and corporate governance such as from cross-shareholdings. Over the past decade, the company has not incurred any material extraordinary losses stemming related to ESG risks, and while some risks like labor-related accidents are not completely avoidable, we currently do not see any additional company-specific risks that can directly affect its uncertainty rating or economic moat.","We assign Daifuku a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium, based on our revised expectations of material handling equipment demand for warehouses, factories, and airports. Although the pandemic-induced e-commerce demand had previously led to a surge in orders and increased the uncertainty for its intralogistics business, we expect demand will be relatively stable after the current postpandemic slowdown from 2024 onward. Further, the companys balanced exposure to various customer industries and stable service income (which makes up approximately 20% of intralogistics sales and above 45% of automobile/airport sales) will mitigate the impact of demand fluctuations of highly cyclical industries.On the other hand, we think the uncertainty of its cleanroom business, which we estimate to be about a third of total operating income, remains high. With flat panel display exposure to be far less than its 2018 peak, we expect medium-term sales to be almost entirely based on semiconductor production trends. Consequently, this hinges on the capital expenditure plans by leading chip manufacturers/foundries, geopolitical dynamics related to semiconductor production, and ability to land new orders outside its existing customer-base, which will require expansion in the U.S. and China.Daifuku is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, and Korean won, relative to the Japanese yen, but the degree varies greatly by segment. While the majority of intralogistics sales comes from Japan, about 25% of its sales comes from North America, making it sensitive to the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar rate. On the other hand, the cleanroom and airport segments have concentrated exposure to Asia ex Japan (Korea, China, and Taiwan) and North America respectively, making them more vulnerable to swings in the rates of their respective currencies.","We rate Daifukus capital allocation as Exemplary. The companys ability to allocate capital to both shareholders and its own operations has surpassed standard levels over the recent years. When it comes to returning capital to shareholders, the company plans to increase its dividends to JPY 105 per share in fiscal 2022 from JPY 70 in 2017. We expect Daifuku will maintain the payout ratio at about 30% going forward.On the operational side, its capital allocation has effectively translated to material improvements in the companys profitability, return on total invested capital and financial health. A key contributor to this comes from its inorganic expansion initiatives, where the company acquired more than 10 companies over the past decade. Daifuku has maintained a careful stance on capital deployment when it comes to acquisitions, where the target companies tend to be small companies with regional presence, and in many cases, the fixed assets of the acquired companies tend to be fully depreciated. Despite high failure rates regarding mergers and acquisitions or M&A (estimated 70%-90% by the Harvard Business Review), we expect Daifukus allocation toward M&A to continue contributing to shareholder value.Daifukus management of fixed assets is similar to its cautious approach with acquisitions. It continues to mainly utilize its production facility in Shiga, Japan, which was established in 1975, thus allowing the company to maintain low depreciation levels, at an average of 1.3% of total revenue over the past 10 years. Further, by having the main components of its products be produced in Shiga Works and then having its engineers go to customer facilities to install the logistics systems, the company has managed to avoid the need to undergo major production capacity expansion (for example, to create additional space). Despite its history of low capital expenditure levels, the company made significant investments in 2019 and 2022, to expand capacity in both overseas and Japan, as well as improve its production structure. We think this is a display of strong stewardship of capital, as it allows Daifuku to develop its local production capabilities in key markets with growth potential and refine its product line at the global level. We think it is also worth noting the JPY 22 billion financing behind its recent record capital expenditures. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company issued new common stock shares through a public offering. However, we believe the decision to issue new shares was appropriate, considering Daifukus share price level was at an all-time high at the time of announcement (above 2.5 times higher than the lowest closing price in 2017) and the additional shares considered dilutive for earnings per share were only up to 3% (including overallotment) of total shares outstanding. Further, the proceeds used for its record capital expenditures in the subsequent years are necessary for overseas expansion as the company looks to capitalize on new growth opportunities and thereby further improve shareholder value.","Daifuku provides manufacturing, engineering, design, installation, and after-sales services for material handling equipment and logistics systems. Its solutions are categorized into six segments: factory and distribution automation solutions (automated warehousing, automated storage and transport systems, sorting systems, and so on), cleanroom automation solutions for semiconductor/FPD production, automotive factory automation solutions, airport baggage handling solutions, industrial computers/controllers, and car-washing machines. The company was founded in 1937 and is headquartered in Osaka, Japan.","Daifuku has maintained a net cash position for the past eight years. From a more long-term standpoint, net debt/EBITDA peaked at 2.95 times in fiscal 2011, when the company acquired Logan Teleflex. Since then the firm has gradually reduced its debt levels (total debt/EBITDA dropped to 0.18 times in fiscal 2022 from 7 times in 2011), while at the same time quadrupling its cash balance to about JPY 102 billion. The company has been able to maintain its net cash position despite making further acquisitions in 2019. Considering its tendency to acquire smaller companies with local presence and overall cautious stance when it comes to deploying capital for acquisitions, we expect Daifuku will maintain its financial health over the medium term.The company has been able to self-fund its capital expenditures with its cash flow from operations in nine out of the past 10 years. In 2019, the companys free cash flow to the firm was negative, as the amount of investment in affiliates as well as record capital investments toward production expansion led to negative cash flow from investments of JPY 15 billion. Since then, free cash flow has remained in positive territory, despite record capital expenditures in 2022.
